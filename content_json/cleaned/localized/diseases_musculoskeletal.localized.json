    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Obtain a nourishing diet. (See \"Bones, Strengthening,\" just below.)\n• Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme which acts to reduce swelling and\ninflammation. Eat half a fresh (not canned or processed) pineapple daily, until the fracture\nheals. Canned pineapple or pineapple juice may contain aluminum salts, pulled by the acid\nfrom the can by the very acid liquid.\n• During healing, the diet should include enough calories in order to provide the energy\nnecessary for new bone-cell formation.\n• You may use clay poultices to alleviate bruising and swelling.\n• Helpful herbs include comfrey and alfalfa. Also helpful are plantain and mistletoe.\n• Also place comfrey over the site of the fracture, to speed healing and reduce pain and\nswelling.\n• Too much calcium supplementation, during bone healing, can induce kidney stone\nformation during the immobile period while the cast is on. The problem is that the person\nis not active enough at that time.\n—For detailed information on rebuilding the bones, see \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\n(Broken Bone)\nSYMPTOMS—There may be extreme pain and tenderness in the injured area, a protruding bone, blood\nunder the skin, or swelling. There may be tingling, numbness, weakness, or paralysis below the fracture.\nA digit, or limb, may be at an abnormal angle or there may be pain at a specific place on a bone.\nA major fracture can cause a loss of pulse below the fracture, weakness, and inability to bear weight.\nCAUSES—A fracture is a crack or break in a bone. If the skin over the bone remains intact, it is a\nclosed or simple fracture; if the bone breaks the skin, it is a compound fracture.\nAccidents are not a common cause of broken bones, but the bone can also be weakened from\nosteoporosis, bone tumors, or metabolic disease. A weakened bone can break much more easily—even\nfrom a slip of the foot, a slight fall, or knocking against something.\nMalnutrition can also be involved. There can be a deficiency of calcium and/or magnesium, or there may\nbe an improper calcium/phosphorous ratio.\nA vibrating tuning fork can be placed against the area; if it causes pain, there is a fracture. X rays will\nconfirm whether it is a fracture or strain or sprain.\nIt is important that the bone be properly set, so it will not thenceforth be deformed, and not function as\nwell.\nOlder people do not absorb calcium and other minerals as well. This begins at 40, increases at 50, and\nvery much so beyond 60. It is believed that 200,000 hip fractures occur in people over 65 every year.\nVery often, this results from osteoporosis. The bone has somewhat hollowed out and the break more\neasily occurred.\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures than other people their age.\nWhen a break occurs, protein fibers form a bridgework between the two parts. Then calcium,\nphosphorous, and silica are deposited between the protein fibers.\n(Oddly enough, although phosphorous is needed for good bone formation, you will find, below, that it is\nimportant that you avoid phosphorous foods if you want strong bones. This is due to the fact that\nphosphorous is the one mineral which is abundantly found in food. Yet too much of it in a meal locks\ninto the calcium and removes it from the body.)\nFirst aid includes covering any wound and immobilizing, or splinting, the broken part in the position it\nwas found (so the problem will not worsen during transport). Take the person to a physician or the\nhospital, depending on the seriousness of the problem. Medical treatment involves placing the bones in\ntheir proper position and keeping them there while healing occurs.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Give vitamin C to bowel tolerance, along with vitamin E and magnesium.\n• Correct the calcium/phosphorous ratio by taking 2,000 mg of calcium a day.\n• Research indicates that plant-derived colloidal minerals tend to reverse spurs and\ncalcium deposits, without surgery, by remodeling the bones.\n• Do not eat meat, coffee, sugar, and alcohol. These upset the mineral balance in the body\nand retard healing.\n• Temporarily avoid citrus fruit.\n• A 1-2 week raw food fast can be helpful.\n• Rubbing the bottom of the feet with ice will help draw healing blood to the area. In the\nearly morning, walk barefoot outside on the wet grass. Then come in and dry off; make\nsure your feet are warm afterward.\n• If the shoes are not comfortable, this can make the pain feel worse. Wear rubber heels on\nyour shoes, not leather. Adding heel cushions to your shoes may reduce pain.\n• Avoid walking on hard surfaces.\n• If you usually walk or jog for exercise, try cycling or swimming instead.\n• It may be necessary to have the spur surgically removed, if it is too painful or irritating.\n(Heel Spur)\nSYMPTOMS—Possible pain at a place where the bone seems to protrude out from the body more than\nit should.\nCAUSES—A bone spur is a pointed growth on a bone. Occurring most frequently on the heel, the bone\nsticks out and occasionally strikes against something, causing pain. Or there may be ongoing pain at the\nsite.\nBone spurs can cause the formation of tiny, painful, tumors at the end of some of the nerves in that area.\nThose with problems with the heel are generally overweight or middle-aged. But they are also common\nin those who have tendonitis, neuritis, arthritis, or alkalosis.\nIf bone pain is felt at an unusual bumpy, protruding, place, x rays will confirm whether the problem is\narthritis, fracture, bone spur, or possibly primary or metastic bone cancer.",

    "title": "Chronic Rheumatism",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Diet changes, water drinking, and weight control are all very important.\n• The amount of urates in the blood is keyed to dietary intake and the amount of body\nweight. Many in middle life who initially experience the pain of gout are overweight.\n• Those with gout need to reduce to 10-15% below calculated normal weight. However,\nweight reduction must be done gradually, so as not to stir up more urates and temporarily\nincrease the number of gout attacks.\n• Do not fast when you have gout. Doing so greatly increases the amount of uric acids in\nthe blood.\n• Drink at least 2 quarts of water a day between gout attacks, not only to get rid of the uric\nacid, but also to reduce the likelihood of kidney damage and kidney stones. Those with\ngout tend to have kidney stones.\n• A high-carbohydrate diet tends to increase uric acid excretion. In contrast, a high-fat diet\ndecreases excretion and may bring on a gout attack (even though they may be unsaturated\nfats). Keep your diet low in protein and fat.\n• A vegetarian diet is the best program for a person with gout.\n• Avoid excessive food yeast.\n• Eating cherries is very helpful. The uric acid level in the blood decreases and the attacks\ntend to stop. They can be any type of cherries, and either fresh or canned (½ pound per\nday). One or two tbsp. of cherry concentrate can be taken instead. If canned cherries are\nused, only use water-packed ones; most have too much sugar and additives.\n• Overeating tends toward gout.\nHere are foods high in purines: liver, brains, kidneys, heart, anchovies, sardines, meat\nextract, fish roes, herring, consommé, mussels, and sweet breads.\n• Here are foods of lesser purine content: fowl, fish (except those listed above), other\nseafoods, and other meats.\n• Here are foods of moderate amounts: whole-grain cereals, lentils, peas, beans, asparagus,\nmushrooms, oatmeal, cauliflower, and spinach.\n• Here are the foods which have only small amounts of purines; foods containing\nnegligible amounts of purines: vegetables, fruits, refined cereals, cereal products, eggs,\nmilk, cheese.\n• There are cases in which drinking large amounts of milk or eating lots of tomatoes\nproduced gout.\n• Do not take any alcoholic beverage. Alcohol increases uric acid production and reduces\nexcretion of urates.\n• Direct injury to a joint, tending toward gout, can bring on an acute attack.\n• It is known that the skin can excrete uric acid, so baths will help.\n• During acute attacks, keep the affected joint elevated and at rest.\n• Hot fomentations for 15 minutes every 3 hours, to help relieve pain. But, to reduce pain,\nsome do better using cold applications.\n• Mud packs, applied to the affected area, will absorb a fair amount of the uric acid.\n• Charcoal is very helpful. Take it by mouth (12-16 tablets daily), and also lay charcoal\npacks on the area.\n• A compress of comfrey root or leaves, blended with water, helps relieve gout pain.\nApply for two hours or more, or overnight.\n• Burdock will help clean uric acid deposits from the joints and other areas. Kelp, red\nclover, and yucca help eliminate uric acid and other toxins.\n• Colchicine is the primary drug medication for gout. But it causes nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, cramping, hair loss, anemia, liver damage, and decreased leukocytes and\nplatelets. Natural remedies can do the job better.\n• A number of drugs increase uric acid levels, so it is best to avoid drugs. Diuretic drugs\nare especially bad.\n—See \"Arthritis\" for much more information.\n—Also see the author's book, Arthritis and Rheumatism (see order sheet), detailing the findings of 63\nresearch studies on various arthritic and rheumatic conditions.\n—Also see \"Gout—2,\" \"Arthritis—1\" and \"Rheumatoid Gout.\"\n(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nRHEUMATISM (CHRONIC) GENERAL CARE—The same as for \"Rheumatism, Acute,\" except\nthat the local applications are made to the muscles instead of to the joints. Sweating baths, especially the\nRadiant Heat Bath and the Steam Bath; long Neutral Baths; Fomentation over painful parts, followed by\nthe well-protected Heating Compress; water drinking; aseptic diet.\nGOUT—1\nSYMPTOMS—Sudden attack, often in the middle of the night, of extreme pain and swelling of a joint\nin the fingers or toes (usually the big toe). But it can affect the ankles, knees, hands, elbows, and wrists.\nMotion or pressure greatly increases the pain. After the swelling subsides, the skin tends to itch and peel.\nDuring attacks, there often is loss of appetite, stomach and intestinal problems, fever, and decreased\nurine output.\nCAUSES—Gout is an acute type of inflammatory arthritis, and occurs most often in people who are\noverweight or eat rich foods, such as meat, gravies, spices, and alcohol.\nThe body cannot handle all the purines and other acids in the meat, and so these products settle in the\nbody. Uric acid is the end-product of the breakdown of purine compounds.\nGout typically attacks the smaller joints of the feet and hands, especially the big toe. Uric acid salts\ncrystallize in the joint, and produce swelling, redness, and a sensation of heat and extreme pain.\nUnlike most forms of arthritis, gout affects men in 90% of the cases. It generally does not begin until\nafter 35 years of age; peak age of onset is 45. Women who have it are generally post-menopausal.",

There\nis a frequent clenching of the jaws.\nPossible headache, toothaches, dizziness, pain and ringing in the ears, and pressure behind the eyes\nWhen eating or yawning, there is a clicking, grinding, and popping noise, and perhaps pain. There may\nbe difficulty in opening and closing the jaws.\nCAUSES—The bite is misaligned, either as a cause of the jaw problem or as an effect. The cartilage\ndisk that cushions the joint becomes damaged. This causes the bones of the temporomandibular joint to\nrub against one another instead of gliding smoothly past each other. If the tooth repair or replacements\nhave not been done properly, this can be a factor in causing the problem.\nStress, a poor bite, and bruxism are the most frequent causes. Some people develop the habit of\nclenching their teeth together during the day and/or at night. Called bruxism (which see), this is very\nhard on the joint in the jaw.\nAn injury, poor dental work, osteoarthritis, bad posture, repeated or hard blows to the jaw or chin,\nwhiplash, gum chewing, thumb sucking, chewing on only one side of the mouth, or holding the phone\nbetween the shoulder and jaw.",

    "title": "Muscle Cramps",
    "contentEn": "(Muscle Pain, Leg Cramps; Charley Horse)\nSYMPTOMS—A pain in a body muscle, most often in the legs (especially the calf muscles) or feet.\nCAUSES—Muscle cramps may occur at any age. Between the ages of 15 to 80, a full 50% of people\nwill, at some time, have pain or cramps in the legs. Leg pains in children are frequent enough that they\nare called \"growing pains.\"\nReduced blood supply to the legs is part of the problem. Another is an imbalance in the levels of calcium\nand magnesium in the body or a deficiency of vitamin E.\nBut other causes have also been noted: arthritis, anemia, tobacco usage, inactivity, poor circulation, too\nmuch or too little exercise, muscle injury, allergy, fibromyalgia, arteriosclerosis, dehydration,\nhypothyroidism, heat stroke, and varicose veins. Diuretic drugs for heart problems, or hypertension can\nalso induce cramps. Those who have had part of the stomach removed tend to have muscle cramps\nthereafter.\nIf cramping occurs when walking and stops when you cease, it may be impaired circulation and nothing\nmore.\nIf leg cramps occur during pregnancy, they may be caused by hormone changes, fatigue, uterine\npressure, chilling, or muscle tenseness.\nA calcium deficiency can make the leg muscles trigger-happy; the contractions in the muscles are\nstronger.\nLeg cramps in older people may be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the circulatory system. Turn to\nthe articles on heart and blood vessels, and see your physician. Vitamin E (600-800 IU daily) is very\nhelpful.\nIMMEDIATE TREATMENT—\n• Massage the muscles and use heat to relieve pain.\n• A heating pad may be applied to the area. For some, alternate hot and cold compresses\nwork better (heat for 6 minutes and cold for 30 seconds, with 4 changes).\n• Drink peppermint tea and apply it as an external compress.\n• Pinch the upper lip between the thumb and index finger, and hold for 20-30 seconds till\nthe cramping disappears.\n• If you are pregnant and cramping occurs, push the toes upward while applying pressure\nto the knee, to flatten the affected part.\n• Here is the strangest advice of all: The next day, repeat the activity that made you sore.\nDo it with much less intensity. This will help work out the soreness. Thereafter, follow\nthis hard/easy routine; for it takes 48 hours for the muscle to properly recover. This is how\nserious athletes train.\n• An alternate method is to vary activities, such as regular walking, with occasional biking\nor swimming instead.\n• After hard exercise or physical work, slow down instead of stopping suddenly. The\nbloodstream is loaded with lactic acid; so slowly exercise at a relaxed pace while it drains\noff. (However, that will not protect you from soreness the next day, resulting from torn\nmuscle fiber.)\n• Perhaps you need to change into more comfortable shoes, in order to improve your leg\nand foot problems.\nONGOING CARE—The blood circulation needs to be improved and equalized.\nDrink enough water each day.\nA common mistake is to drink water and take salt tablets during heated exercise. Instead, you need a full\nrange of electrolytes, and not so much sodium chloride. Drink fruit drinks. At mealtime, eat lots of fresh\nfruits and vegetables. Include seaweed in your diet. Potassium broth (from thick white potato peelings)\nis excellent.\nA fat-free, sugar-free, salt-free diet improves the circulation.\nEat an abundance of green leafy vegetables, in order to improve the quality of the blood and the mineral\nbalance.\nAlfalfa, brewer's yeast, and kelp are important.\nA deficiency of calcium, potassium, selenium, and vitamin E exists.\nMineral imbalances can produce cramping. Be sure you are getting enough calcium through\nsupplementation. Otherwise the phosphorous in certain foods locks with it, so the calcium cannot be\nabsorbed. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for more information on solving the calcium-phosphorous\nproblem.\nThose with dentures, who find eating vegetables difficult, are especially prone to magnesium and\ncalcium deficiency and leg cramps. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw\nvegetable juices daily.\nEvery 3 hours, drink a large glass of quality water, to help clean the bloodstream, liver, kidneys, and\nbowels of stored toxins.\nDrink less whole milk\nEat your meals slowly and chew well.\nDo not smoke. Nicotine greatly impedes blood circulation. Avoid second-hand smoke.\nIf you are taking diuretic drugs, take supplemental potassium. Better yet, switch to corn-silk tea and\nother herbal diuretics; also drink more water (see the several articles on kidneys and urine).\nDo not stand in one position for hours without moving. Some motion or shifting of body weight is vital.\nGet off your feet for 5 minutes every hour. If possible, during that time, take your shoes off; massage\nyour feet and wiggle your toes.\nDo not sit with crossed legs.\nStretch your legs every so often, with the feet flexed up, not down.\nWhen sitting, try to elevate your feet every so often.\nDo not wear garters or any binding clothes.\nAt night, wear roomy pajamas.\nKeep the bed covers loose or use a foot cradle, to keep bedding weight off the feet. If you sleep on your\nstomach, extend your feet over the edge of the bed. Another method is to sleep on your side, with your\nlegs bent and a pillow between your knees.\nRub olive or flaxseed oil into your muscles before and after strenuous exercise.\nTwice a day, soak in a tub of warm water (100o-110o F.). Massage the toes, feet, and calves.\nHere is an exercise which really helps stop ongoing lower leg cramps for many people: Stand with shoes\noff, facing a wall 2-3 feet away. Lean forward, bracing against the wall with hands and arms, all the\nwhile keeping your heels on the floor. When a moderate pull is felt in the calves, hold that position for\n10 seconds.\nThen stand straight for 5 seconds of rest, and lean forward and repeat. Do 3 stretching cycles.\nIf you are overweight, reduce to normal range or slightly below.\nIf leg cramps are caused by varicose veins or pregnancy, elevate the foot of the bed 9 inches.\nIf leg cramping occurs during pregnancy, take frequent rest periods with the feet elevated. Wear\ncomfortable, not tight, clothing. Be sure you are getting enough calcium; this is important.\n—Also see \"Claudication,\" which has the same leg symptoms—but some very special, dangerous\ncauses.

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• According to one view, sprains should be treated with ice or very cold water. Follow this\nby bandaging the injury with an Ace bandage.\n• But, according to a different view, sprains should be initially treated with alternate hot\nand cold—especially if it is in the wrist, elbow, or ankle. This method works better than\nusing cold alone!\n• Put the injured part in very hot water, and keep it there 20-30 minutes. Every few\nminutes take it out of the hot water and plunge it into cold water for about a minutes, then\nback into the hot. Keep the hot water hot. This can continue for up to 2 hours with good\nresults.\n• Repeat this for several days; and, twice a day, massage around the area.\n• If you use the cold method alone on a sprain, you may not be able to walk on a sprained\nankle for days; use the alternate hot and cold method, and you may be much better in half\nthe time.\n• (A third method calls for cold on strains to begin with, to reduce initial swelling,\nfollowed by alternate hot and cold afterward.)\n• If the sprain or strain is in the back or shoulder, treat it with hot fomentations, short cold,\nand massage.\n• A bad bruise on any part of the body can be treated as for a sprain or strain.\n• In addition to the above, strains frequently require a cast similar to that used for a\nfracture, so the injured joint area can be immobilized for more complete rest.\n• DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is a liquid that can be applied externally to the injured area,\nto relieve pain, reduce swelling, and promote healing. But only buy it in the health food\nstore.\n—Also see \"Athletic Workouts.\"\n(Sprains and Strains)\nSYMPTOMS—Bruised wrists, ankles, fingers, knees, back, hips, and sore or swollen muscles.\nCAUSES—Muscle injuries can occur when straining muscles too much, using them too long or hard,\nsuddenly twisting, or hard falls.\nAthletes frequently have such problems.\nSprains are a painful stretching of ligaments of the joints, caused by lifting, sudden stops or turns,\ninjuries, or falls.\nStrains are more severe; They involve torn ligaments and torn joint capsule, with bleeding and swelling.\nThe following suggestions are good both for prevention and treatment of injuries:",

    "id": "disease-musculoskeletal-backache",
    "title": "Backache",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\nFirst, we will consider less serious back pain:\n• The most common cause of backache is muscle strain. Rest will generally eliminate the\nproblem. Bed rest for 24 hours may be needed.\n• Soaking in a tub of warm water may be quite relaxing to a strained back.\n• For the first 72 hours after a back strain occurs, an 8-minute ice massage often helps.\nUse ice cubes (or freeze water in a paper cup or frozen fruit- juice can). Massage the area\nand about 6-8 inches around it.\n• After 72 hours, use alternate hot and cold applications. Apply a wrung-out hot towel for\n30 seconds, followed by brief cold. Do this 4-5 times.\n• Ice packs are especially helpful in relieving muscles spasms.\n• Moist heat reduces local inflammation and increases blood flow to the area.\n• Some people think that staying in bed for a week will help back pain. This is not true. If\nyou remain in bed a week, it will take two weeks to rehabilitate.\n• Stretching a sore back will tend to accelerate the healing process. Gently bring your\nknees up from the bed and to your chest. Once there, put a little pressure on your knees.\nStretch, then relax. Do this again.\nPreventive measures that will help you, either before or after experiencing back problems:\n• Be very careful when lifting something. Take several deep breaths, to increase muscle\nstrength and then slowly lift with the legs, not the back, and hold the object close to your\nbody. Do not lift from a bending forward position (closing windows, lifting things from\ndeep in the car trunk).\n• Keep the body warm and do not become overly fatigued. When the muscles are chilled\nor you are exhausted, it is easier to injure joints because the muscles are not able to do the\nwork needed.\n• Do not take a hot bath just before doing heavy exercise, for your muscles will be in a\nweaker condition.\n• Proper nutrition, including adequate amounts of calcium, minerals, vitamin D, etc. See\n\"Bones, Strengthening\" for much more on this.\nExercises, to build the muscles are very important, if you would avoid back trouble. More on this later in\nthis article.\n• Walking and rowing are good for the back (walking is good for just about everything!).\n• When sleeping, either a firm mattress should be used or a ¾-inch thick ply board should\nbe placed beneath the top mattress. Place 1-2 pillows under the knees to straighten the\nlumbar curve. When lying on the side, flex the knees and place a pillow between them.\n• Avoid sleeping on the stomach; it increases the swayback and twists the neck. This is\ndue to the fact that the trunk, being heavier, sinks farther into the bed, causing the back to\narch.\n• It is reported that water beds, which do not make a lot of waves, may help people with\nback trouble to sleep.\n• When you get out of bed, roll out slowly and carefully. Do not sit straight up in bed.\n• If you have back pain, slide to the edge of the bed. Then, keeping your back rigid, let\nyour legs off the bed first. That will act as a springboard, lifting your upper body up and\noff the bed.\n• Sit in a straight chair with a firm back. The knees should be higher than the hips; if\nnecessary, use a small footstool. Avoid soft sofas and stuffed chairs. Chair arms help\nsupport the shoulders and upper back. Get up and move about every so often.\n• When in a car, push the car seat forward, to raise the knees higher than the hips. This\nlessens back and shoulder strain. Use safety belts.\n• Look for a car with adjustable lumbar support, and adjust the support down as low as it\ngoes. Then, if necessary, raise it a notch or two.\n• Do not stand in one position for long periods.\n• High-heeled shoes will bring trouble sooner or later. Women should wear low-heeled\nshoes if they want to protect their pelvic organs and spine.\n• Good posture when sitting, standing, or walking should be the goal.\nExercises to strengthen the back:\n• Do press-ups which are half a push-up. Lie on the floor, on your stomach. Keep your\npelvis flat on the floor and push up with your hands, arching your back as you lift your\nshoulders off the floor. This will help strengthen your lower back.\n• Do floor swimming. Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise your left arm and right leg.\nHold for one second, then alternate with the right arm and left leg. Go back and forth. This\nextends and strengthens the lower back.\n• Do a crunch sit-up. Lay on your back on the floor, with knees flexed and feet flat on the\nfloor. Cross your arms with your hands on your shoulders. Raise your head and shoulders\noff the floor as high as you can while keeping your lower back on the floor. Hold for one\nsecond, then repeat.\n• Know your limit when exercising. If you feel fine 1-2 days after exercising, then it is\nsafe to continue them.\n• Spinal surgery: Should you have a back operation? Sometimes the problem is so serious\nthat a back operation is necessary. But, if at all possible, try to avoid having one. Not only\nare they expensive, but frequently do not solve your movement and pain problems. It is an\nintriguing fact that, according to U.S. government reports, only 1% of those with back\npain obtains relief from back surgery. And there is always the possibility that the\noperation will only result in greater pain, more serious damage, and even less mobility.\nBut, after weighing all the possibilities, you may still decide to undergo it.\n—Also see \"Sciatica.\"\n(Low Back Pain; Sciatica; Slipped Disk; Lumbar Disk\nHerniation; Spinal Disk Prolapse)\nSYMPTOMS—Pain in the back, frequently in the lower back.\nIf pain comes after lifting something heavy, after coughing, or after unusually heavy exercise, and the\npain prevents you from moving or shoots down one leg, you may have a herniated disk.\nCAUSES—Backache, or pain felt in the spinal column, is one of the most common reasons for\nhospitalization in the Western world. Your spinal column has a complicated interconnection of muscles,\ntendons, bones, and ligaments.\nIt is helpful to identify the various parts of the spine, also called the vertebrae (singular is vertebra): The\ntop part of the spine, where the neck is located, is called the cervical spine (or cervicals); the shoulder\nand mid-part (which protrudes outward in an adult) is called the thoracic; the lower portion (called the\nhollow of the back) is the lumbar; and the bottom part (ending in the tailbone or coccyx) is the sacrum.\nThe first cervical is the atlas. This enables your head to tilt up or down. The second is the axis; it permits\nyour head to turn from side to side.\nAches and pains in the lower back can be a chronic problem. This pain can be in the spine or it can be in\nthe sacroiliac. The sacroiliac joint connects (articulates is the correct word) the spine to the pelvic bone.\n(There can also be pain in the muscles of the lower back; it is called lumbago.)\nA subluxation occurs when two vertebrae get out of proper alignment with one another. A chiropractor\nputs these back in place for relatively little cost.\nSciatica is chronic pain in the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve, which\npasses down through the upper leg, can experience neuralgia and neuritis as a result of a pinched nerve\nin the lumbar region. If the problem is not solved, eventually the leg where the pain is may no longer\nreceive nerve signals from the brain or the central nervous system.\nThe intervertebral disks (also spelled discs) are made of cartilage and act as cushions between the\nvertebrae. Each disk has a tough, fibrous, outer layer surrounding a soft interior, which provides the\ncushioning.\nLumbar disk herniation and lumbar disk prolapse occur when the disk herniates (ruptures or breaks) and\nsome of this soft inner disk material pushes outward against the spinal cord to one degree or another.\nThis may be very serious; and, like sciatica, it can lead to muscle wasting, reduced nerve reflexes, and\nmuscle weakness. Disk herniation and prolapse are often erroneously referred to as a \"slipped disk.\"\nCauses of lower-back pain include wrenched or damaged muscles, bones, tendons, or ligaments, Kidney\nor bladder infection, prostate problems, or female pelvic disorders may cause backache. Overeating,\noverdrinking, eating the wrong kinds of food, and constipation can also be involved. The spinal bones,\nand muscles attached to them, are weakened by wrong habits. Chronic conditions causing back pain\ninclude arthritis, bone disease, or abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis).\nOther causes of back pain are poor posture, walking habits, improper shoes, lifting, straining, calcium\ndeficiency, slouching when sitting, or soft mattresses.\nThere is a definite relationship between smoker's cough and severe back pain. Injecting the nicotine\nequivalent of one cigarette decidedly reduced the measured blood flow in the vertebral body. It is also\nthought that using tobacco interferes with the elasticity of connective tissue.\nA small percentage of lower-back pain may be linked to flat feet.\nSometimes a serious case of constipation will cause an ache in the back, from impacted stools or\npressure from gas.\n(More rarely, back pain can result from congenital abnormalities, metabolic disorders, cancer, or\nreferred syndromes.)\nThe back pain can also be the result of an excess of lactic acid in the muscles, following muscular\nexercise. Drinking enough water helps lessen this problem.\nWhere can you go to get help with your bad back? There are lots of experts out there:\nChiropractors adjust the back by pushing and thrusting. They also recommend nutritional and lifestyle\nchanges. In 1994, the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research issued a report, that\nchiropractors generally provided the most effective treatments for acute back pain. They cost far less, do\nthe job quicker, and do not give medicinal drugs (most of which are usually poisonous). The British\nMedical Journal reported that chiropractic treatments proved more successful than hospital treatments in\nnearly every way.\nX rays are generally considered a routine part of back pain diagnosis; yet only a few back conditions\nshow up on x rays! If the pain is caused by muscle strain or a herniated disk, an x ray will not reveal\nanything because muscles, disks, and ligaments are all soft tissues. Beware of x rays if you are pregnant.\nOrthopedic surgeons are another source of help. These are medical doctors who also do back surgery,\nthey are very likely to recommend it—and that is something you want to avoid, if at all possible.\nOsteopaths can prescribe drugs and do surgery also, but they are less likely to do so.\nPhysiatrists, also called doctors of physical medicine, are also medical doctors. They have a good record\nof helping to solve serious back problems (such as disk problems) without resorting to surgery (which\nthey are not licensed to do). They recommend lifestyle changes, back braces, etc.\nPhysical therapists try to restore muscle strength and joint and spine mobility.\nWhich back pains are the most serious?\nBack pain that comes on suddenly, for no apparent reason.\nBack pain that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, stomach cramps, chest pain, or\ndifficult breathing.\nAn acute attack of back pain that lasts more than 2-3 days, without any relief.\nChronic pain which lasts more than 2 weeks.\nPain in the back which radiates down the leg to the knee or foot.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Give a nourishing diet, restricting all salt. Put on a water and fresh fruit and vegetable\njuice diet. Eat no solid food until the fever subsides and joint pain is reduced. Then\nmaintain a light diet, including fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, etc.\n• Avoid caffeine, fried foods, soft drinks, processed or refined foods, sugar, or salt.\n• Bioflavonoids are especially valuable in preventing and treating rheumatic fever.\n• Bed rest is very important.\n• While in bed, massage and mild exercise is helpful. A planned exercise program should\nbe undertaken later.\n• Useful herbs include bayberry bark, goldenseal, yellow dock, pau d'arco, and burdock\nroot. Echinacea and dandelion are also good.\nSYMPTOMS—Pain, inflammation, and stiffness in a large joint, such as the knee. These initial\nsymptoms are accompanied by pain.\nThe pain and swelling can travel from one joint to another. A skin rash may also appear.\nCAUSES—Rheumatic fever is a streptococcal disease (Streptococcus Group A), and occurs between the\nages of 4 and 18. It tends to follow a bout with tonsillitis, scarlet fever, strep throat, or an ear infection;\nmost often strep throat (see \"Tonsillitis\")\nAfter the disease appears ended, it may recur again later.\nRheumatic fever affects one or several body organs or locations: joints (arthritis), brain (chorea), tissues\n(nodules), skin (erythema marginatum), or heart (carius). It may also result in residual heart disease,\nproducing permanent damage to one or more heart valves. (See \"Arthritis\" and \"Chorea.\")\nThe residual heart valve damage is the most dangerous aspect of untreated rheumatic fever. Treatment\nearly in the course of the disease will generally prevent the heart damage. But this treatment may require\nthe help of a physician and a stay in the hospital.
