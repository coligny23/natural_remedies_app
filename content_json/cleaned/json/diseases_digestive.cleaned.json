Leafy, dark green vegetables and garlic are important.\n• Do not eat meat, and avoid alcohol and nicotine!\n• Make a gallon of goldenseal tea (stronger than you would drink); and, after straining out\nthe herb, put the leg in it for an hour. When finished, let it dry for 10 minutes; apply olive\noil in, and around, the ulcer. Dust a little powdered goldenseal on it. If needed to keep out\ninsects, put a light gauze bandage over it while letting the air in. It will heal, but slowly.\nAs much as two months may be required.\n—Also see \"Abscesses\" and \"Boils.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Open sores which develop on poorly appearing skin areas of the legs.\nCAUSES—Leg ulcers occur when the blood circulation to the legs is inadequate. Skin tissue tends to\nerode and ulcers can form. Individuals with varicose veins, thrombophlebitis, or other conditions caused\nby poor circulation are most likely to develop this problem.",

Throughout the day give small amounts of water, fruit juices, or ice chips,\nto help restore lost fluid.\n• Do not give junk beverages (colas, black tea, coffee, or alcohol), for they will only\nirritate and intensify the symptoms.\n• When vomiting and diarrhea cease, give small amounts of non-irritating food, such as\ncooked rice, plain cooked potatoes, cooked carrots, bananas, or apple sauce.\n• Avoid processed and greasy foods; avoid milk and high-roughage foods.\n• Do not be quick to let him up from bed, for the vomiting and loss of fluids may have\nweakened him.\n• Especially in small children and infants, watch for signs of dehydration. These signs\ninclude drowsiness, rapid respiration, and dry skin and mucous membranes. This is\nimportant.\n• Mix 1 tsp. of catnip tea leaves in a cup of water, steep for 15 minutes, and drink while\nwarm. This is very soothing to the digestive system.

    "title": "Chronic Gastritis",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• For rapid pain relief, drink a large glass of water. It dilutes the stomach acids and flushes\nthem out.\n• Avoid all situations resulting in tension, stress, irritability, nervous strain, anger, or fear.\nComplete rest and relaxation from pressing problems and worries is needed.\n• Do not eat fried foods, tea, caffeine products, salt, chocolate, animal fats, strong spices\nor soft drinks. Do not drink cow's milk. Do not smoke (if you do, do not expect the ulcer\nto heal properly).\n• A diet high in sugar increases HCl production. White bread also causes more HCl to be\nmade.\n• In earlier years the recommended treatment included frequent feedings, milk intake, and\na bland diet. But this approach is being discarded.\n• It is now known that the calcium in milk only stimulates acid production rather than\ndecreasing it, as was taught for years. (Milk does initially neutralize HCl, but the calcium\ntriggers gastrin, which causes the walls to excrete more HCl.)\n• In addition, it is now known that sipping milk and cream can lead to myocardial infarcts\n(heart attacks). The problem seems to be the butter fat in the sippy diet.\n• The bland diet approach is also being discarded because those foods neither relieve pain\nnor speed healing. So, instead, eat whatever good food works best for you.\n• Potatoes are very helpful. They are soothing and have an alkaline reaction.\n• Vitamin U is the anti-ulcer vitamin. It is specifically for peptic ulcers. Raw cabbage juice\nand alfalfa have the most. Boiling destroys this anti-ulcer factor, and wilted cabbage\ncontains less vitamin U. Drink fresh, raw cabbage juice immediately after juicing.\n• Eat plenty of dark green leafy vegetables. If symptoms are severe, eat soft foods\n(potatoes, squash, bananas, yams, etc.) Put other vegetables through a blender.\n• If you have a bleeding ulcer, add some psyllium seed to the food.\n• Well-cooked white rice and millet are good.\n• Eat several small meals.\n• Do not eat between meals. Doing so slows emptying of the stomach, and thereby\nincreases HCl amounts in the stomach.\n• Chew food slowly and properly.\n• Also helpful are flax, German chamomile, licorice, catnip, bayberry, goldenseal, hops,\nvalerian, and myrrh.\n• Exercise neutralizes stress. Maintain a daily program of out-of-door exercise.\n• Make sure the bowels move daily or take cleansing enemas.\n• Do not take antacids or painkillers, such as aspirin. That only increases the problem. The\ncalcium carbonate in the antacids doubles the amount of HCl production. The aspirin\ncauses the stomach to bleed!\n• Do not use medicinal drugs.\n• For peptic ulcer pain, apply an ice bag to the abdomen just above the navel. Or place it\non the spine between the shoulder blades.\n—Also see \"Peptic Ulcer—2.\"\n(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nAVOID CAUSES—such as mustard; pepper; vinegar, strong acids; even acid fruits; sugar; preserves;\ncheese; alcoholic beverages; tea and coffee; all indigestible and irritating substances; coarse vegetables;\npickles; confectionery; and hasty eating.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL REST—Avoid the use of fish, fowl, game, and all flesh foods which excite the\nsecretion of HCl (hydrochloric acid) and remain long in the stomach. Coarse vegetables; fried foods;\nfats, except in a natural emulsified condition; large meals; tea; coffee; wines; and all liquors are to be\navoided.\nINCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE—Graduated Cold Baths, twice daily.\nCOMBAT LOCAL CONGESTION—Fomentation over stomach area, 3 times daily, 15 minutes at a\ntime.

Ice Bag over stomach, half an\nhour before eating.\nPAIN IN STOMACH—Revulsive Compress over stomach and intestines; repeat several times daily if\nnecessary. Avoid acid fruits, very hot foods, very cold foods, and concentrated sweets, if they cause\npain.\n—Also see \"Gastroenteritis.\"\nPEPTIC ULCER—1\n(Gastric Ulcer, Stomach Ulcer; Duodenal Ulcer)\nSYMPTOMS—Chronic burning or gnawing stomach pain, which often begins 45-60 minutes after\nfinishing a meal or at night. Drinking a large glass of water or eating food relieves it. Vomiting or\nswallowing something quite alkaline also does. The pain sometimes awakens the person at 1 or 2 a.m.\nPain just beneath the breastbone is a frequent symptom of an ulcer. Sometimes it radiates to the back.\nThe pain is often considered to be heartburn or an empty stomach.\nOther symptoms may include headaches, a choking sensation, lower back pain, itching, and possible\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers occurring in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers\noccurring in the top part of the small intestine. However causes and treatment are essentially the same.\nThese ulcers can be caused by wrong food or too much food. They can also be induced by severe\nnervous and mental stress.\nThe walls of the stomach pour a powerful acid into the stomach (hydrochloric acid, or HCl). This\npowerful fluid is needed to digest protein. Although the walls of the stomach are protein, they are not\nnormally disturbed by the fluid. But when there are problems with people or with the food—then trouble\ncan begin.\nThe stomach acids begin digesting the walls of the stomach, because too much HCl is being produced;\nprotective mucous, in order to protect the walls, is not being produced; or both.\nThese ulcers can occur in the esophagus, but generally occur in the stomach or small intestine.\nGastric ulcers (peptic ulcers in the stomach) occur 2½ times more often in men than in women, most\nfrequently in the 40-55 age group.\nDuodenal ulcers (peptic ulcers in the small intestine) occur in the first 11 inches of the small intestine,\nand are caused by excess HCl from the stomach. These ulcers are found in men 4 times as often as in\nwomen, and most frequently between 25 and 40 years of age. Duodenal ulcers occur 10 times more\noften than gastric ulcers. As much as 15% of the U.S. population have ulcers, but only about half are\ndiagnosed. Some are not discovered until the person begins vomiting blood. Ulcers especially occur\nduring the spring and fall, and tend to run in families.\nMany factors affect stomach-acid secretion. Stress and anxiety increase it. Aspirin, steroids, anti-\ninflammatory drugs, and smoking—all increase HCl production.\nWhen you have stomach pain, drink some lemon juice. If the pain gets worse, you have too much acid in\nyour stomach.\nHypoglycemics tend to produce too much HCl and are in danger of eventually having a peptic ulcer.\nIf you vomit blood or have \"coffee-ground\" stools, then the ulcer is bleeding. You are in danger of\nbleeding to death—go to a hospital immediately.",

Do this 4 times each day.\n• Most cases of hepatitis are self-limiting and will heal with rest and supportive care.\n• Avoid sugar, fat, and alcohol.\n• Vitamins B and C are important.\n12\n• He should have bed rest until the acute stage is past; also he should have initial liquid\nfasting, followed by a light diet. The patient often has a poor appetite and does not feel\nlike eating, even though he should.\n• Drink plenty of water, avoid constipation. He should bathe frequently, and wash his\nhands with soap after every bowel movement. The toilet seat should also be washed after\neach usage.\n• He should not prepare food for others, and his own utensils should be sterilized after\neach of his meals.\n• His linen and clothes should be washed separately.\n• In China, 10% of the population have hepatitis at any one time. That is 100 million new\ncases each year. As one might expect, the rate of liver cancer is quite high there.\n• A word to the wise: Gay men often take jobs working in restaurants; yet they have a high\nrate of hepatitis B and C infections, both of which do not reveal symptoms for weeks or\nmonths, during which they can, and do, transmit the infection to customers through food\nthey handle. Something to think about the next time you want to eat in a restaurant or café.\nSYMPTOMS—Weakness, nausea, headache, vomiting, fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite,\ndrowsiness, dark urine, joint stiffness and pains, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, light-\ncolored stools, and often jaundice (a yellowing of the skin, which will first be noticed in the eyes and\nmucous membranes). Skin rashes and itching may also occur; the latter is caused by excess bile salts\nunder the skin.\nCAUSES—Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, and may be caused by a virus, bacterium, or toxic\nsubstance. But, in most instances, the cause is viral. There are actually several main types of hepatitis:\nHepatitis A (infectious hepatitis): Transmitted by contaminated water, milk, or food, it has an incubation\nperiod of 15-45 days. The contagion is highest just before illness begins, so food workers can transmit\nthe disease. Hepatitis A is contagious from 2 weeks to 1 week before the illness starts. It is easily spread\nby person-to-person contact and through contact with food, clothing, linens, etc. It can be transmitted\nfrom animals. Eating shellfish is a good way to get it, even if the waters they live in pass national\nstandards. Recovery generally occurs within 4 weeks. Chronic cases are less likely to occur.\nHepatitis B (serum hepatitis): Found throughout the world and spread as HIV is—through contact with\ninfected blood (contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusions) and sexual contact. Six cases have\nbeen traced to contaminated acupuncture needles. About 5% of all Americans and 85% of gay men have\nit. Hepatitis B is very serious. It has an incubation period of 28-160 days (2-6 months), and recovery\nmay require 6 months. All during that time, it can be passed from one person to another. In increasing\nnumbers, cases are reverting to chronic active hepatitis, which can result in liver cirrhosis and death.\nHepatitis B is the ninth major killer in the United States.\nHepatitis C: Contracted in the same manner as HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C may take 6 months to\nproduce symptoms, yet all that time it can be spread from one person to another. Between 20-40% of all\nhepatitis cases are of this type. It accounts for 90-95% of all hepatitis transmitted by blood donations.\nHepatitis E, hepatitis non-A, and hepatitis non-B also exist, but are of lesser significance in North\nAmerica. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is in epidemic proportions in Africa and Asia, and is\nbecoming a serious problem in Mexico. It is generally contracted from drinking sewage-contaminated\nwater. Such water should be boiled before using.\nAll of the above are primarily viral forms of hepatitis. But there is also one which is caused by toxic\nchemicals. It is called toxic hepatitis. The amount to which the liver was exposed to the poisonous\nchemicals, fumes, drug, etc., determines the amount of damage to that organ.\nOverall, there are 40,000-70,000 reported, new cases of hepatitis each year in America. But the experts\nsuspect that there are probably ten times that many which go unreported. It most often occurs in young\nadults, and is highest in teenage girls.\nHepatitis A is decreasing, and hepatitis B is rapidly increasing. It is fourth among the 30 leading\ncommunicable diseases.",

In case of pus in the gallbladder, there may be (and may not be) chills and fever.\nTherefore be alert, if chills and fever occur.\nThe presence of gallstones tends to irritate the lining of the gallbladder.

If the pain is severe, apply the heat\nfor an hour, remove for an hour, and then apply again for an hour, until relief comes.\n• Take charcoal tablets, to relieve gas and bloating. But do not use it daily or it will cause\nconstipation.\n• The pain may be sharply increased by drinking cold liquids and eating food. It is now\nknown that the pain is generally associated with constipation. (See \"Constipation.\")\n• The person may think he has too much gas, but studies reveal only that the normal\namount of gas in his intestines bothers him more. But it would still be wise to avoid gas-\nforming foods. (See \"Bloating\" and \"Belching.\") Avoid swallowing air. Do not chew gum\nor smoke, drink enough water, and avoid carbonated beverages.\n• Eat more bran (oat bran, etc.) and it will produce more normal bowel movements.\nCoarse bran works better than fine bran. A high fiber diet is particularly important in\nsolving IBS.\n• Add crushed psyllium seed to your diet.\n• Avoid stress, strain, worry, and rush.\n• Avoid tobacco, tea, coffee, soft drinks, alcohol, and drugs.\n• Research shows that refined sugar needs to be avoided if you want to return to normal\nliving.\n• Do not use sugar substitutes (sorbitol, etc.).\n• Do not take antacids or laxatives.\n• Eat on a regular schedule. Do not skip meals or eat between meals. Let your digestive\nsystem rest before the next meal.

(See\n\"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\")\n• Avoid animal fats, butter, fried foods, and dairy products.\n• Because of the ongoing diarrhea, people with IBS require as much as 30% more protein\nthan normal, as well as an increased intake of minerals and trace elements.

But be sure and include fiber if you are on a soft diet,\nand some protein.\n• Wear loose-fitting clothing.\n—Also see \"Colitis.\"\n(Mucous Colitis, Spastic Colitis,\nIntestinal Neurosis)\nSYMPTOMS—There are three basic patterns:\n(1) constipation and pain; (2) alternating constipation and diarrhea; (3) and painless diarrhea with\nmucous. Diarrhea frequently occurs upon arising, and again following breakfast. For the remainder of\nthe day, he may be constipated. Diarrhea at night is rare. Instead of diarrhea, stools sometimes are pasty\nand very narrow.\nAlso present may be gas, nausea, bad breath, heartburn, severe headaches, bloating, lack of appetite,\nweakness, faintness, backache, and heart palpitations.\nPain is often triggered by eating, and may be relieved by a bowel movement.\nA fifth of those with this problem also experience rectal bleeding.\nCAUSES—Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common digestive problem which patients see\ntheir doctor about. About one-fifth of Americans have the problem. Primarily occurring between the age\nof 20 and 50, women have it twice as often as men. It is said that three-fourths of the population\nexperience it at some time in their lives. Yet IBS is comparatively unknown in cultures where people eat\nsimply, and not too much of it.\nThe fundamental problem is that the muscles of the small and large intestines contract in spasms rather\nthan regularly. Something in the food bothers the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract,—probably the totality of\nthe strange things Westerners eat: processed, greasy, fried, sugared, chemicaled, synthetic, drugged, and\nalcoholed food; and eaten hurriedly, at irregular times.\nThese spasms cause the food to pass through the GI tract either too fast or too slow. When too slowly,\ntoo much water is absorbed, causing hard, dry stools; when too fast, too little water is absorbed and the\nstools are watery.\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a nuisance, but is not life-threatening. But be aware that symptoms of IBS\nmay indicate more serious problems, which sometimes are related by IBS: arthritis, diabetes mellitus,\ngallbladder disease, malabsorption disorders, candidiasis, pancreatic insufficiency, skin disorders, ulcers,\ncolon cancer, and parasitic infections, such as amoebiasis and giardiasis.\nThere are diseases which have similar symptoms, such as diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative\ncolitis, and lactose intolerance.",
