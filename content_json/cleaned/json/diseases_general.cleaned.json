Those who do so, may feel weaker for a\nfew days, but afterwards will generally feel much better and stronger.\n• Over-indulgence in sex is an excellent way to debilitate the body. Worry wears out the\nlife forces. The use of coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and processed and junk foods are also\nsources of trouble.\n• Trust in God, obey the Ten Commandments, and live as healthfully as you can.\n• A good program of better nutrition, more rest, less tension, and taking time to go\noutdoors and work or walk 30-60 minutes at a time will do much to build the body. A cold\nmorning shower invigorates the body.\n• As an aid in rebuilding the body after acute or chronic illnesses, the following herbal\nformula is quite helpful. It combines nutritional benefits with herbal tonics:\nMix together 1 oz. parsley root, 1 oz. alfalfa; 1/2 oz. of each of the\nfollowing: dandelion root, comfrey root, yellow dock root, burdock root,\nnettles leaves, and dulse. Place in an uncovered pot with a quart of water\nand simmer for 20 minutes. Let it cool, then strain. Place the liquid back in\nthe pot and simmer uncovered for one hour or until it is reduced to one cup.\nStir in one cup of unsulphured blackstrap molasses and refrigerate. Take\none tablespoonful 3 times a day.\n• A variant method would involve taking the powdered, mixed, dry herbs (not having gone\nthrough the cooking stage), place them in #00 capsules, and take 2-4 caps with each meal.\nHYDRO—Here are water treatments, explained in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet),\nwhich will increase endurance: Tonic frictions, which include Wet Hand Rub, Cold Mitten Friction,\nCold Towel Rub, Wet Sheet Rub, Dripping Sheet Rub, Ice Rub, and Salt Glow (WTM, pp. 97-105). In\ncases of severe exhaustion, bed rest for a time, proper diet, plus carefully graduated tonic cold\napplications, especially Percussion Douche to spine (p. 228).\n(Weak, Debilitated Conditions)\nSYMPTOMS—A feeling of exhaustion all or much of the time.\nCAUSES—This can be caused by a number of dietetic, physical, or hormonal problems, some of which\nare mentioned below.

Regularity in bowel movements are\nessential. Add fiber to the diet. Cleansing enemas should be used occasionally. Get plenty\nof rest. Do not overexert yourself with heavy exercise.\n• Remove from the diet all junk foods, processed foods, fried foods, stimulants (coffee,\ntea, soft drinks, sugar), and white flour products (bread, spaghetti, etc.)\n• It is said that 60 percent of those with EBV also have candida (see Candidiasis),\ntherefore it is best to eat some form of acidophilus. Eliminate sugar, alcohol, mushrooms\nand all fungi, molds and yeast, fermented foods such as sauerkraut, soy sauce, dry roasted\nnuts, potato chips, soda pop, bacon, pork, lunch meats, and all types of cheese.\n• Eat some brand of \"greens\" tablets. Chlorophyll is vital to proper diet and healing. Make\ngreen drinks from whizzed up greens and pineapple juice.\n• Take no aspirin, since it may induce Reye's syndrome (especially in children).\n• Helpful herbs include red clover to cleanse the blood, echinacea to help the glands, garlic\nas an antibiotic, and saffron to help reduce pain.\n—Also see \"Lyme Disease,\" which has similar symptoms. Also see \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"\n(Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)\nSYMPTOMS—Recurrent upper-respiratory tract infections, exhaustion, extreme fatigue, sore throat,\nswollen lymph nodes, achy joints and muscles, memory loss, low-grade fevers, headaches, poor\nconcentration, night sweats, irritability, and deep depression. Because the symptoms resemble flu and\nother viral symptoms, EBV is not always diagnosed correctly. In fact, it is frequently misdiagnosed as\nhypochondria, depression, or psychosomatic illness.\nCAUSES—Chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). This condition has\nbecome widespread in America. the CDC in Atlanta estimates that tens of thousands of people are\ninfected with it. Yet they are unaware of it since symptoms are frequently not prominent.\nThis virus is also the cause of infectious mononucleosis. When mononucleosis occurs, the person\nbecomes very ill for two to four weeks, or longer if the diet is not corrected. (See \"Mononucleosis.\")\nEBV is a type of herpes virus, and is related to the viruses that cause genital herpes and shingles.\nKeep in mind that chronic fatigue syndrome can also be caused by certain other factors: candida albicans\n(yeast infection), anemia, chronic mercury poisoning from dental amalgam tooth fillings, hypoglycemia,\ninsomnia, and hypothyroidism. (All of the above problems are dealt with in articles in this book.)\nOnce EBV is contracted, it always remains in the body. Fortunately, most people develop antibodies to\nit. The problem occurs when they become run-down and overworked—and then the dormant EBV\nstrikes. It is more likely to reveal its presence when other diseases are also present, such as arthritis,\nlupus, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or AIDS.\nEBV causes the body to overreact, resulting in a burn-out of the immune system.\nEpstein Barr virus is very contagious, and can be transmitted by close contact, kissing, sharing food,\ncoughing, and through sex.\nBlood tests for antibodies against candida albicans, EBV, HBLV and CMV are available for specific\ndiagnosis. Yet the fact remains that EBV symptoms are similar to those for many infections, anemia,\nparasites, endocrine diseases, and AIDS.",

Some of it is also regularly found in your mouth, throat, and genital tract. But\nthis organism goes wild when its competitors, the normal bacteria of the intestines, are killed by long\nterm use of antibiotics. This enables the candida to greatly increase in number.\nStress causes a reduced production of stomach acid, which lets candida enter the stomach—a place\nwhere it normally is never found. As a result, less digested food enters the intestines, much to the liking\nof the candida which feeds upon it.\nThis yeast-like substance proliferates so massively that it enters the blood stream and is carried to many\nparts of the body, weakening the immune system and causing various problems.\nIn the oral cavity, candida is called thrush. White sores may develop on the tongue, gums, and inside the\ncheeks.\nIn the vagina, it results in vaginitis. Large amounts of a white, cheesy discharge and intense itching\noccur.\nOther effects are food allergies, athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch, and even diaper rash.\nCandida is not transmitted sexually, but mothers may pass thrush on to their newborn children. The\nbaby's tongue will appear red and be covered with white spots (generally appearing 8-9 days after\ndelivery) that will appear like milk spots. On the buttocks, thrush may resemble diaper rash.\nBecause their vaginal environment is more conducive to the growth of yeast, diabetic women can\ncontract candida easier than diabetic men.\nYou may wish to request a blood test for antibodies against C. albicans. A skin test, similar to a TB tine\ntest, is also available. A positive result is clear-cut. Unfortunately, a negative one provides less certainty\nthat one does not have it. Candida is difficult to diagnose, since a culture cannot be used. This is because\nthis yeast is a normal constituent of everyone's intestines.\nTREATMENT—Try to eliminate food allergies, hypoglycemia, any infections, and indigestion.\n• Replant Lactobacillus acidophilus. This is the friendly intestinal bacteria which the\n\"wonder drugs\" earlier killed off. Lactobacillus is a primary competitor of candida for\nfood in the intestine. Use a retention enema containing 4 oz. warm water and 10 billion\norganisms (empty twenty 500,000 organism capsules into the water). Use 3 times weekly,\n10 minutes each time.\n• Helpful herbs include burdock, echinacea, ginger, golden seal, bee pollen, kelp, lobelia,\npassion flower, pau d'arco, psyllium, slippery elm, ginkgo, and suma.\n• Useful nutrients include vitamin B complex with extra biotin: 100 mg 3 times a day. /\nB12 lozenges: place 2,000 mcg lozenge under tongue 3 times a day between meals. /\nEssential fatty acids: Wheat germ oil, primrose oil, etc. / Garlic capsules: 2 caps 3 times a\nday. / Multivitamin cap, 2-3 times a day. Take vitamin C up to bowel tolerance.\n• Also helpful: vitamin A: 25,000 IU one to two times a day; B6: 100-250 mg one to two\ntimes daily; vitamin E: 400-800 IU daily; biotin; aloe vera juice: 2 oz. four times per day.\n• Do not use oral contraceptives while you have candida. Do not use sugary foods. Do not\nuse cheese, alcohol, chocolate, fermented food, gluten grains (wheat, oats, rye, and\nbarley). Do not use meat, pickles, raw mushrooms, vinegar, or any yeast products.\n• Yeast thrives on sugars and carbohydrates. A vegetarian nondairy diet of protein,\nunrefined grains, and vegetables is best. Onions and garlic are very helpful. Fresh, raw\ngarlic is the best. Avoid meat-based proteins, since these are associated with abnormal\nbowel flora development. Avoid yeasted grain foods.\n• Avoid antibiotics and steroids, because they destroy the competing bacteria and allow\ncandida to overgrow.\n• Wear cotton underpants, rather than close-mesh synthetic or silk.\n• An alternative to douching is the sitz (sitting) bath. Fill a shallow tub to the hip with\nwarm water, then add salt (enough to make the water taste salty, about 1/2 cup) to match\nyour body's natural saline state. Add 1/2 cup vinegar to help rebalance the vaginal pH to\n4.5. Then sit in the water, knees apart, until it gets cool. The bath will do the cleansing.\nDouching can be done with a similar mixture (4 teaspoons vinegar to 1 pint of water).\nINFANT THRUSH—Four percent of infants have oral thrush. Keep rubber nipples clean, as well as all\nobjects going into baby's mouth. If bottle-feeding, boil nipples and bottles 20 minutes after thorough\nwashing (candida spores are heat resistant). Give plain water to cleanse the mouth after every feeding.\nInspect the mouth before each feeding, and begin treatment if thrush is seen. Swab infected areas with\nsaturated solution of baking soda 3-4 times a day. Garlic overpowers candida, so it may be swabbed on\nthe lesions several times a day.\n—Also see \"Vaginitis,\" \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"",

If you remain in the sun, even though resting and\ndrinking fluids, your temperature will continue to rise! Do not return to the sun for many\nhours!\n• In the early stages, drink large amounts of mineral-rich vegetable and fruit juices to\nreplace water and electrolyte loss in perspiration. Water, by itself, does not replace\nelectrolytes. Potassium-rich vegetable broths are helpful.\nPREVENTION—Plan ahead, so you will not come down with heat stroke later:\n• Drink water. Drink diluted electrolyte drinks. Avoid salt tablets. They do the opposite of\nwhat they are supposed to do. The increased salt in the stomach keeps fluids there longer.\n• Do not use caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco. The first two accelerate dehydration, and the\nsmoking constricts blood vessels.\n• Over several days' time, adapt yourself slowly to the sun. Do not overexert when out in\nit.

When there is too\nmuch jostling back and forth, movement which you do not have control over (as when riding in cars,\nplanes, or boats), your sensory system may become overloaded. Since the eyes also sense vertical\nbalance, when what you see does not seem to agree with what your labyrinthine receptors in the inner\near sense, then mental confusion results.

Some foods are high mucus-forming. Overcooking\nof food is part of the problem. Pasteurized milk, white flour, sugar foods, and meat should\nbe avoided if you want to cut down on mucus. Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. If you\nhave cooked food at a meal, begin with raw food. This will help the digestive system\nhandle the increased load that cooked food places upon it.\n• Indigestible food also forms higher levels of mucus in the body. Any specific allergen (a\nfood or substance toward which you are allergic) may cause catarrh.

Eucalyptus oil also\nhelps. Be sure and drink enough water. As intake decreases, the mucus thickens and cuts\noff breathing.\n• During the illness, you may drink primarily of fluids (fruit juices) at times.

Vegetables and fruits must be washed, and then immersed in boiling water for a few seconds,\nthen peeled.\n\nTREATMENT\n• If the fever gets too high (above 102o F. in adults or 103o F. in children), immediately\nimmerse the body in tepid water to lower the temperature.\n• Other suggestions would include: ice packs on the forehead, running cool water over the\nwrists, cool baths and drinking certain herb teas, such as feverfew, cinchona bark, and/or\nwhite willow.

Keep the rest of the body\ncovered.\n• Cool tap water can be sponged on the skin to dissipate excess heat. Wring out a sponge\nand wipe one section at a time, keeping the rest of the body covered. Because of rapid\nevaporation, you will not need to dry him with a towel.\n• Some people shiver when they have a fever. In such cases, immerse them in a tub of\nwarm water. This will also lower temperature. For babies, give room-temperature baths.\nSandwich them between wet towels, which are changed every 15 minutes.\n• If very hot, remove more covers and clothes; if chilly, add them.\n• When signs of fever are gone, be sure to prevent chilling.\n• Putting too many clothes on a child can actually cause a fever.\nREOCCURRENCE—If feverish flu-like symptoms keep reoccurring; in children this might indicate\ndiabetes, and in teenagers and adults Epstein Barr virus.\n—Also see \"Fever Diseases.\" Also see diseases listed under \"Childhood Problems (\"Chickenpox,\"\n\"Diphtheria,\" Measles,\" \"Mumps,\" \"Scarlet Fever,\" etc.).\nSYMPTOMS—A fever is an elevation of body temperature above normal. A fever is not a disease, but\na symptom that an infection or disease is present. Fevers are common in a wide variety of diseases, from\nmild to severe.\nSymptoms include headache, flushed face, body aches, nausea, little or no appetite, and sometimes\ndiarrhea or vomiting. Skin may be warm with some perspiration, or hot and dry. The elevated\ntemperature is an effort by the body to burn out infection, and the perspiration helps eliminate toxins.\nTherefore a partial fever may be helpful to the body in fighting the infection. If the fever does not get too\nhigh, let it run its course. Many enzymes, antibodies and white blood cell responses are better during\nslightly elevated temperatures.\nMORE ABOUT FEVERS—Normal is generally considered to be within a range of 97o to 99o F., but it\ncan vary among individuals. If it is 100o F. or above, it is a fever. One should not have undue concern\nunless the body temperature rises above 102o F. in adults or 103o F. in children. Then call a doctor\nimmediately.\nWhen body temperature is not more than 5o above normal, it does not completely interfere with body\nfunctions. But levels above 105o F. are dangerous; at 106o F., convulsions are common; at 108o F.,\nirreversible brain damage frequently results.",

Quinine\nwill generally eliminate the malaria, but a mild to severe hearing loss may also result.\n• The other way is to give hot and cold water treatments to the person. This takes work.\nThe result is equally good, but no hearing loss results.\n• During the fever, give cold applications (cool wet sheet packs, sponge him off with cool\nwater, etc.). During the chills, give him hot applications (hot packs).\n• Give goldenseal tea.\n—See \"Fevers\" for additional suggestions.\nSYMPTOMS—Chills occur for several hours, followed by drenching sweats every 1-3 days.\nCAUSES—There are four types of parasites which are introduced into the bloodstream by the anopheles\nmosquito. If the disease becomes chronic (recurrent), it results in general debility, anemia, and an\nenlarged spleen.\nSevere cases can be very debilitating. An especially deadly form is called blackwater fever. The skin\ntakes on a yellow tint and the urine becomes progressively darker in color. Few people survive three\nattacks of blackwater fever.\nThis disease generally occurs only in tropical climates, but it can and does occur in the United States as\nwell.",

Eat broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, onions, garlic, and similar worthwhile food.\nSkip the junk food.\n• High doses of vitamin A in the form of carrot juice (beta carotene) are especially helpful.\nThat, along with vitamin C, may be the most important vitamins for the immune system.\nEssential fatty acids (fresh or newly purchased flaxseed oil is especially good); zinc at 50\nmg, three times a day; selenium at 300-900 mcg per day, germanium at 50 mg/day.\n• Vitamin B complex, especially B6, B12, folic acid, and pantothenic acid. Vitamin E:\n400-800 units.\n• Herbs include echinacea root, dandelion, red clover, and kelp.\nSYMPTOMS—It is the immune system which fights infections, and it does this by triggering defenses\nagainst invading bacteria. The antibodies and antitoxins of this system recognize these foreign bodies\nand send white blood cells to attack them. With his immune system weakened, a person is less able to\nwithstand Epstein Barr virus, candidiasis, food allergies, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, etc.\nInfections occur more easily. The person is more susceptible to colds, infections, and viruses.\nCAUSES—Autoimmune disorders can result from conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to\nkidney disease. Unrelenting stress, chronic allergies, chronic infections can exhaust the immune system.\nMedicinal drugs, such as cortisone, prednisone and chemotherapy cause immune depression! Beware of\nthem! Other causes of a weakened immune system are vaccinations and immunizations against common\nchildhood and epidemic diseases. The thymus gland seems to be the most affected by this weakening.\nThe thymus gland is especially important due to its production of T-helper cells.\nProlonged stress, or toxic exposure to chemicals or radiation can weaken the immune system. Severe\ninfections can both result and cause it. An example of this would be allergies (resulting from immune\nmalfunction) which follow a severe case of rheumatic fever, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or other acute\nviral or bacterial disease. Lack of proper rest is yet another cause.\nYet another cause are nutritional deficiencies. Some natural healing specialists believe that any\ninfectious disease may be considered an immune deficiency problem.\nThe taking of aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, asthma, low birth weight and birth defects.\nMeat contains hormones, antibiotics, and bacteria which brings on disease. Alcohol, nicotine, and a high-\nsugar diet weaken the immune system. Air pollution is yet another problem (move out of the city!)\nHypothyroidism can also result in immune deficiency. Marijuana, cocaine, and the morphine family are\nother culprits. Mercury amalgam fillings are yet another incipient cause.",

    "contentEn": "SYMPTOMS—It usually begins suddenly with fever, fatigue, arthritis and/or joint pain. Those with it\nare frequently misdiagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis. Ninety percent of lupus occurs in women in\ntheir 30s. Other symptoms include a characteristic facial \"butterfly\" rash, severe hair loss, and papular\nskin lesions. This rash forms over the nose and cheeks in something of a butterfly shape (which tends to\nintensify because of sunlight).\nThe skin lesions are small, yellowish lumps. They leave scars when they disappear. (\"Lupus\" means\n\"wolf\" in Latin; indicating the rough-skinned appearance it gives to the skin.)\nAlso generally present are kidney disease (in 50% of those with lupus) and low white blood cell count.\nAll this, in turn, produces inflammation of the joints and/or blood vessels, affecting many parts of the\nbody.\nSometimes the first appearance of the problem is an arthritic-like condition, with swelling and pain in\nthe joints and fingers. Severe cases can affect the brain and heart.\nSometimes the central nervous system is affected, and deep depression, amnesia, seizures, or psychosis\ncan result.\nCAUSES—Lupus is an inflammatory disease of the connective tissue. It has been classified as an\nautoimmune disease, since the body is attacking itself.\nUltraviolet rays in the sun can trigger the first attack. Stress, childbirth, fatigue, infection, chemicals, and\ncertain drugs can also bring it on.\nTREATMENT—Dr. Max Gerson used a careful, very nourishing diet, including vegetable and fruit\njuices and vitamin-mineral supplementation to eliminate lupus in his patients, but the dietary change had\nto be total or no progress was made. All meat, gravy, fats, junk food, fried food, soft drinks, caffeine,\nalcohol, etc. had to be eliminated from the diet. The diet had to be low in fat and salt (thus helping the\nweakened kidneys).\n• It is best to eliminate all unsaturated fats. Fats quickly become rancid and, in that form,\nharm the connective tissue, and wear away the myelin sheath which covers the nerves.\n• Avoid eating alfalfa sprouts, for they contain canavain which, in your body, replaces its\narginine.\n• A vegetable juice fast would be very helpful.\n• Do not take birth control pills; they can intensify the lupus.\n• Up to 10% of the lupus cases originate by taking medicinal drugs (New England Journal\nof Medicine). Pollutants, additives, chemicals, and certain foods can also bring it on.\nWhen the cause is drugs, the kidneys or nervous system are generally not affected, the\nlupus is a milder case, and it tends to stop when the drug is no longer taken.\n• Parasites are associated with lupus. The parasites excrete droppings which interfere with\nbody functions. Until the blood stream is cleansed and the parasites removed, healing\ncannot commence.\n• Allergies can be another causative factor. Search them out and eliminate them. Here are\nseveral to consider: beef, cow's milk, wheat, corn, ammonia, hair spray, formaldehyde,\nperfume ethanol, pesticides.\n• Those with Raynoud's disease should live carefully, for they are also prone to\ncontracting lupus. Those with lupus are often misdiagnosed as having syphilis. Lupus is\nnot AIDS. HIV destroys the body's immune system, but lupus is one's immune system\ndestroying his body.\n• Obtain enough rest and exercise. Avoid all stress.\n• Echinacea, yucca, red clover, pau d'arco, and goldenseal are helpful herbs.",

In the U.S., estimates run to 200,000 to 4 million;\nof which 90% are women.\nBecause each symptom affects different parts of the body, physicians and dentists often treat the\nsymptom which applies to their field as minor and of little consequence.\nTests are available to diagnose the disease. The cause is, so far, unknown. And, to date, there are no\nknown cures. The treatments, some of which are noted below, only help a person live with the condition,\nrather than solving it. Yet, if it can save your eyesight or an internal organ, it is worth it.\nTREATMENT—You can learn much more about this condition by contacting the National Sjogren's\nSyndrome Association, P.O. Box 42207, Phoenix, AZ 85023 (800-395-NSSA); they will send you free\nliterature.\n• Or contact the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation, 333 North Broadway, Suite 2000,\nJericho, NY 11753 (516-933-6365).\n• They will tell you that artificial tears (eye drops) and salivas, ointments and ant-\ninflammatory drugs are among the treatments prescribed.\n• We asked one individual we know, who has Sjogren's and believes in, and regularly\nuses, natural remedies, and were told this:\n• Women with this problem produce too much estrogen, in relation to the amount of\nprogesterone they make. So purchase progesterone cream and rub in on the belly.\n• For the eyes, add 1/4th tsp. of table salt (or its equivalent in seawater) to one cup of\nwater, bring it to a boil, then let it set until it is tepid. Put some of this in the eyes every so\noften. Do not use store-bought salt, because it contains aluminum, which may damage the\neyes. Take emulsified vitamin A, and use torula yeast. Black walnut husk tea may help.\n—Also see \"Dry Tear Ducts.\"",

But there can be other reasons.\n• Exercise is important. Lack of it causes loss of bone and muscle mass, and inevitable\nphysical degeneration. Walk out of doors every day! Your life depends on it. Breathe\ndeeply. Be positive and cheerful as you walk. Hold your head up and enjoy it.\n• Hearing loss can accompany aging. Too much fat in the diet, and lack of vitamin A can\ncause hearing problems. Some physicians suggest that hearing loss is a sign of later heart\ndisease.\n• Processes of aging are accelerated by poor living, wrong eating and drinking habits, and\ndangerous activities. Some people make themselves prematurely old.\n• Older people do not absorb nutrients as well as younger people. This includes vitamins,\nminerals, and amino acids. Enzymes and co-enzymes are not produced as abundantly as\nthey formerly were. Food supplements are needed even more than in earlier years.\n• Eat good, nourishing food, but do not overeat. You are not working hard physically, as\nyou once did. Experimental rats were given much less in food calories, and lived 50%\nlonger.\n• Systematic undereating is one of the key secrets of longevity. Lose weight and keep\nslim. Extra weight rapidly ages you.\n• Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. A high fiber diet is important. If you are not\nhungry, then do not eat very much.\n• Brittleness and fragility of bones result as calcium is more poorly absorbed. Make sure\nyou are obtaining an adequate supply of calcium, vitamin D, and copper.\n• Drink freshly-made carrot juice every day.\n• If possible, drink only spring or steam-distilled water. Keep your body's water table\nhigh. It will go a long way toward protecting you against later heart and blood vessel\nproblems.\n• There is increased oxidation of cells with the advance of years. Take vitamin E to help\nsafeguard against this. Vitamins A and C are also antioxidants.\n• The B complex are needed for good brain function, proper digestion, sound nerves, and\nphysical stamina.\n• Vitamin C in your diet will lessen the likelihood of strokes and blood vessel ruptures. It\nstrengthens the body, and promotes healing of wounds. It fights infection.\n• Make sure you are obtaining enough minerals. Take a vitamin/mineral supplement so\nyou will get enough potassium, iron, selenium, zinc, and all the rest.\n• Eat a little Nova Scotia dulse or Norway kelp each day to get those needed trace\nminerals.\n• Stop smoking, drinking, and living in excess. Throw out the caffeine and processed\nfoods. Go to bed on time. If you cannot sleep in the middle of the night, pray and thank\nGod for your blessings. Go outside and breathe deeply of the good night air, then go back\nto bed and to sleep.\n• As much as you can, stay away from medicinal drugs, and you will be happier for it.\n• A person who is depressed or negative will age faster. Cheer up, go to God and surrender\nyour life to Him. Obey His Ten Commandment laws and trust your life to Him. Be\npeaceful in Christ. Find in Him your strength and hope.\n• It can be more difficult to deal with stress as you get older. God can help you with that\nalso.\n• Find someone to help, write to, and pray for.\n• Helpful herbs include ginseng, gotu kola, echinacea, cayenne, pau d'arco, hawthorn, and\nsuma.",

They generally do not begin appearing till\nthe age of 20, and occur equally among men and women. Older people have them less frequently.\nCanker sores generally heal by themselves within a week or two. It is said that as much of 40% of the\nadult population experiences them.

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Apply sugar or honey poultice to the sore; it will help draw out the poisons. Local\napplications can also include zinc oxide ointment, aloe vera, wheat germ oil, or comfrey.\nAvoid meat products. Make a paste out of crushed comfrey leaves and slippery elm, and\ncover the sores. Wash the sores 3-4 times a day with a combination tea (witch hazel and\nmyrrh or goldenseal). Mix powdered comfrey leaves and slippery elm in equal parts, mix\nwith water, make a paste, spread on a cloth, and tie it over the sore. It can be left on\novernight. When dry, sprinkle some powdered goldenseal or echinacea over the sores to\ndisinfect the area; cover with cotton or wool (not a synthetic fabric).\n• Improve the diet; this is crucial to solving the problem. Drink enough liquids, even when\nnot thirsty. Avoid processed, fried, and junk food. Do not eat meat.\n• The diet should include enough fiber. Oat bran is especially good. The bowels should\nmove every day. Lower the pH with acid foods (such as cranberries).\nPREVENTION—Prevention is much easier than treatment.\n• Use protective padding on the bed, massage the skin to stimulate the circulation, and\nkeep the skin dry and clean. Turn the patient regularly. Watch for signs of redness.\nOccasional sunlight to the skin is beneficial. Sponge bathe daily with a mild herbal soap\n(never with harsh soaps). The bed must be kept clean and the sheet without wrinkles.\nSheepskin bed covers help disperse weight more evenly. The use of air or water\nmattresses can be helpful. Sponge baths are helpful. Loose-fitting clothing allows air to\npenetrate to the skin (cotton is best). If the patient can sit up, have him do it 3-4 times a\nday. Sometimes prop him up with a pillow.\n• Give a well-balanced, adequate diet. Give plenty of greens and carrot juice. Give\nvitamins A, B, C, E, and zinc.\n• Apply vitamin E oil to the skin area.\n• The alternate hot and cold compress is very helpful. This is a fomentation application\nwith the application of a cold compress after it.\n(Pressure Sores)\nSYMPTOMS—These are deep skin ulcers—especially found on buttocks, hips, sacrum, shoulder\nblades, elbows, and heels.\nCAUSES—These ulcers form during periods of prolonged bed rest, as pressure is continually applied to\nbony parts of the body. The bedridden elderly, the unconscious, and the paraplegic are those most likely\nto experience this problem.\nSuch individuals generally have a high pH (too alkaline), and are deficient in vitamins A, B2\n(riboflavin), E, and C, as well as zinc.",

Keep hands away from the face.\n• Wash the hair twice a week.\nSYMPTOMS—Blackheads are small, tallow-like plugs formed in the pores by the accumulation of dirt,\noil, and bacteria. They are black, at the exposed end, because of oxidation rather than the presence of\ngerms. They generally cause no itching or pain, but are unsightly.\nCAUSES—The duct of an oil gland becomes plugged with partly dried oil mixed with, more or less,\ndust or dirt.

Freckles are caused by melanin pigments which react\nto the sunlight in fair-skinned people. Liver spots are the result of a \"ceroid\" pigment build up in the skin\nof older people.\nThese latter spots are the outward signs of free radical destruction within the body. There is pre-\noxidation of fats—in the cells instead of in the liver. Free radical damage produces waste materials in\ncells throughout the body, including the brain and liver.

Although he is a little fellow, you know he is there.\nScabies is found on all social levels. Contact, even by a handshake, is all that is needed to acquire it. It\ncan also be transmitted through clothing and bed linen. It is more common in older adolescents and\nyoung people, and in girls rather than boys. People can also get it from touching dogs, other animals, or\ntheir bedding. It is a special problem in institutions, such as nursing homes, etc.\nScabies can only be accurately diagnosed by taking skin scrapings and viewing them under a\nmicroscope.

Place 2 lbs. of ether in a muslin\nbag and set in a hot bath (104o-106o F.).\n• A paste of cream of tartar and water can be applied to the area.\nLonger term solutions:\n• Try to find the cause or causes of this problem. Here are some of the things which result\nin hives in others:\n• Stress, food allergy (milk, wheat, eggs, shellfish, pork, onions, some fruits), chlorine in\ndrinking water, adrenal exhaustion and/or liver congestion resulting from an allergy,\nhydrochloric acid deficiency, food dyes, preservatives, drug allergy, acid conditions,\ninsect stings, chronic infection, penicillin in the milk you drink, aspirin, coffee, alcohol,\nand tobacco.\n• Secondary factors will be spinal lesions, stoppage of lymph flow, imbalance between\ndeep and surface blood circulation, and adrenal exhaustion.\n• Another factor is improperly (too hurriedly) weaning a child from breast milk.\n• Reading over the above lists, it appears that the primary cause is frequently a physical\nreaction to a substance which the body cannot tolerate to have put into it. We live in a\nchemical age. One cannot even drive down the highway without breathing dangerous\nfumes.\n• Do not use steroids, alcohol, or processed foods.\n• Lymph stasis and poor circulation may result from poor skin function, lack of exercise,\nfresh air, and poor elimination; but ingesting poisonous substances top the list.\n• Aside from trying to find the chemical offenders, prolonged fasting is generally\nconsidered the best method of terminating recurrent hives. This cleans out the body and\nenables it to better deal with the chemicals it is daily confronted with. Fasting will help the\nintestines and other organs to heal. It will eliminate toxins and help the bowels begin\nworking properly again. Trunk packs will help induce sweating. Moderate sunbaths will\nhelp also.\n• As a rule, fasting should not be over 1-3 days in length. If you are overweight, longer\nfasts might be considered. If you are thin, never go over 3 days; indeed, one meal or 1 day\nfasts are best for frail individuals. A carrot, beet, and green vegetable juice fast is better\nthan a straight water fast.\n• Use enemas during the fast, and even afterward, until the hives do not return. Maintain\ngood bowel action thereafter.\n• Also important are dietary changes: Be sure and get nutritional supplements, including\nvitamins A, B complex, B6, B12, C, and calcium. You may need to take hydrochloric acid\nwith meals.\n• There is one other cause which we have not yet mentioned: a lack of unsaturated fatty\nacids. The best is wheat germ oil. Flaxseed oil is also outstanding. But corn oil would be\nacceptable. In addition to including only such oils in your diet, you would do well to rub\nwheat germ oil on the affected area.\n• When the problem exists for weeks or months, it is vital that you identify the cause, so\nyou can eliminate the hives.\n• Chronic hives can be linked to candida.\n• When severe anaphylactic reactions occur, immediately take the person to the hospital. It\nis best not to let situations come to such a crisis. Solve the problem before hives produces\nsuch an emergency.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\n(Urticaria)\nSYMPTOMS—Strong itching (pruritus) may suddenly occur. Elevated wheals result, along with\nswollen eyes. The subsequent scratching makes you appear swollen and scratchy. The intense itchy\nwheals which may result may disappear in minutes, hours, or several days. Hives are generally gone\nwithin 1-7 days, except in cases of severe hypersensitivity, when death may result. Occasionally a fatal\nanaphylactic reaction occurs. At such times, edema of the breathing passages produces respiratory\ndifficulty similar to severe asthma.\nCAUSES—The skin is reacting to allergies, physical irritation, stress, or emotions. Special dermal cells\nbegin releasing histamine, which causes internal blood vessels to leak fluid into the deepest layers of the\nskin.\nMeat; dairy; and poultry products, especially in frozen or fast foods, are frequent causes of hives. This is\ndue to the chemicals, antibiotics, and hormones given to farm animals.\nHere is a list of special things known to cause hives in some people:\nAspirin, antimony or bismuth (in various metal alloys), anti-pyrine or phenacetin (pain relievers),\nbarbiturates, BHA and BHT (preservatives), phenobarbital or chloral hydrate (sedatives),\nchlorpromazine and meprobamate (tranquilizers), fluoride (dental products and fluoridated drinking\nwater), food colorings, griseofulvin (antifungal), insulin, liver extract, menthol (in perfumes, candy,\ncigarettes), mercury (dental fillings), morphine, penicillin, pilocarpine (glaucoma medication),\npreservatives, procaine (anesthetic, known as novocaine), quinine, (quinine water and malaria\nmedication), reserpine (heart medication), saccharin (artificial sweetener), salicylates (flavoring and\npreservative), sulfites (preservative in dried fruit), and thiamine hydrochloride (cough medications).",

    "title": "Impetigo",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Impetigo is actually an early sign of immune depression, which allows organisms\nnormally on everyone's skin to produce disease. The body needs to be built up.\n• Proper nutrition is needed, along with sanitary living conditions.\n• In some individuals, a food allergy (such as milk, wheat, or soy) or a contact dermatitis\n(such as detergents in the clothes) weakens the immune system—permitting the impetigo\nto gain a foothold.\n• Strict hygiene is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection to other parts of the\nbody—or to other people.\n• Vitamin A is necessary for good skin health. Give the child a good multivitamin\nsupplement. Give vitamin C, to bowel tolerance.\n• Put a wash of boric acid and herbs such as comfrey, golden seal, or echinacea on the\naffected area.\n• Place garlic oil, squeezed from capsules, on the area.\n• Removal of the crusts results in a more rapid cure. Bathing in soapy water every 4 hours\nduring the day is helpful. Severe cases may require a slightly salty or hydrogen peroxide\napplication (3 parts water to 1 part 3% peroxide). Apply soaks or warm compresses to the\nattached crusts. Hot and cold compresses may be applied after the crusts are gone. At\nnight, charcoal poultices can be attached and left overnight.\n• Use disposable tissues instead of cloth handkerchiefs. Each person should be given his\nown towel and washcloth. Wash the hands frequently; and, while the infection lasts, keep\nthe fingernails short and clean. Change pillowcases and bed sheets daily, and boil all\nlinens for 10 minutes. If possible, isolate the child.\n• Exposure to the air and sunlight will help, but do not swim.\n• If impetigo is on the scalp, cut the hair so you can treat it.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\n(Impetigo Contagiosa; Echthyma)\nSYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—Impetigo is not something to ignore. Neglected, it can produce boils,\nulcers, or other skin complications.\nUntreated, it can result in deep infections of the tissue beneath the skin. Impetigo is a skin disease\ncaused by a streptococcal bacteria. It occurs primarily in children, especially in undernourished ones,\nand in the summer months. Lower economic groups living in crowded conditions are the most likely to\ncontract it. It is more frequently found on the face, hands, and arms next and feet and legs third.\nCuts, abrasions, insect bites, and stings allow entry of the bacteria. An area of redness is seen, followed\nby blister-like swellings. The fluid is straw colored. If not scratched, the lesions break down in 4-6 days\nand form a honey-colored crust which heals slowly. The skin beneath may lose its color, not to be\nregained for months. The scratching generally results in more skin injury and a spread of the infection.",

The amino acid,\nlysine, can help inhibit the spread of the herpes virus. The diet must include raw fruits and\nvegetables, brewer's yeast, brown rice, and whole grains. Be sure and eat enough protein.\n• Some suggest leaving the blisters alone if they are not too bothersome. Other suggestions\ninclude placing one or more of the following on them: calamine or other calcium\npreparation on them. Calcium is always soothing to skin rash conditions. Apply vitamin E\noil from a capsule to the area.\n• Put cold water on a cloth and place it over the area. The cooler it is, the better it feels.\nAvoid anything that will make your blistered skin hotter.\n• Put apple cider vinegar on it daily. Take hot baths 2-3 times a week. Take a starch bath\n(one cup of cornstarch or colloidal oatmeal) into a hot tub. Colloidal oatmeal is powdered,\nand is at the pharmacy. Do not slip in the tub!\n• Clean out the bowels frequently. Light fruit and vegetable fasts will also help clean out,\nand strengthen, the body. Wear only cotton clothing while the condition exists.\n• Dab the infection with hydrogen peroxide to purify it. If pain exists after the blisters are\ngone, put ice on the area.\n• Avoid drafts. Allow sunlight on the area for short intervals. Gently wash the blisters\nwhen bathing and avoid touching or scratching them.\n• If the shingles appear on the forehead, tip of the nose, or near the eyes, contact an\nophthalmologist. Such cases can lead to blindness.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\n(Herpes Zoster)\nSYMPTOMS—Sharp, burning pain along a nerve route somewhere in your body for 3-4 days. There\nare angry red blisters at that pain site several days later. These are very painful and itchy. Later the\nbumps blister, turn cloudy, and form scabs. It usually lasts 7-14 days from the time the blisters appear\nbefore the scabs drop off. This is no ordinary rash; it is shingles, which is a viral infection of a nerve. It\nmost often occurs on the skin of the abdomen, under the ribs and above the navel. But it can appear\nanywhere on the body. It most frequently occurs after the age of 50.\nIf shingles starts near an eye, beware! The cornea can become infected and blindness may result. You\nwould then do well to consult an eye specialist.\nCAUSES—This staphylococcal infection consists of small round bacteria growing in clusters. The virus\nin the chickenpox you had as a child never really left your body; and, when you are an adult, it comes\nback in the form of shingles. The virus may lie dormant in the spinal cord and nerve ganglia for years\nuntil triggered. It normally lives on the nostrils and skin of everybody.\nWhat triggers the attack? It is known that poisonous substances in food, metals, drugs, and other toxic\nsubstances can do it. For example, risk of shingles increases with the use of anti-cancer drugs. Anything\nthat weakens the immune system can bring on an attack of shingles. Once it occurs, the pain can\ncontinue on for months or years. So it is better to prevent an attack.",

This will eliminate the felon.\n• To relieve pain, put a piece of lemon on it. If on the end of a finger, cut a small hole in\nthe lemon and place it over the finger.

Always wear gloves in cold weather (mittens will keep you even\nwarmer). Wear shoes; do not walk without them when it is cooler. Wear extra warm socks\nin the winter. Dress warmly at all times. Gloves, mittens, and shoes should be warm\nbefore putting them on, since it is difficult for one with this problem to warm them. Wear\nshoes which breathe, so you do not end up with damp, cold feet. Wear a warm hat in cold\nweather.\n• Avoid contact with cold objects, even for brief moments. While preparing meals, use\ntepid, not cold, water.\n• When an attack occurs, immerse the body part in warm (not hot) water, no warmer than\n90o F. Why not warmer water? During an attack, without realizing it, one's skin can more\neasily burn.\n• Massaging the hands and fingers every evening helps reduce the severity of the attacks,\nby stimulating blood circulation in that area.\n• Stressful situations produce a spasm of the blood vessels. As much as possible, avoid\nsuch situations. Keep calm, cheerful, and relaxed. Plan ahead and avoid scheduling\npressures. Trust in God and believe He will care for you. Vigorous outdoor exercise will\nstrengthen the entire body, and also relax it. Exercise tends to neutralize the attitude and\neffects of stress.\n• Avoid fatty and fried foods, all junk foods. At least 50% of your diet should be raw food.\nAvoid food items which tend to bother you (allergenic foods). Avoid caffeine (caffeine,\ntea, soft drinks, chocolate). Caffeine restricts blood flow. Use a fat-free, sugar-free diet.\nSugar increases blood viscosity as well as triglycerides. Avoid food seasonings.\n• Do not take any tobacco product or use alcohol. Nicotine causes constriction of the\nblood vessels and it produces plaque in them, both of which reduce blood flow. Do not be\neven in the same room where someone is smoking.\n• Medicinal drugs for Raynaud's do not seem to help. The side effects outweigh the\nbenefits (ergot, beta blocking drugs, cytotoxic agents, etc.). Do not take birth control pills.\n• Avoid machinery which vibrates the hands. In one study, 50% of pneumatic drill\nworkers had Raynaud's, compared with 5.6% for the average population. Such equipment\nincludes chain saws, metal grinders, stone cutters, lathes, and manual typewriters.\n• Drink enough water, but not soft drinks. Eat a high fiber diet which includes some\npsyllium seed, to help clean the colon. Eat slow-cooked grains and a low protein diet.\n• Take vitamin E (80-1,200 unites per day), unsaturated fatty acids alone (wheat germ oil,\netc.), tryptophan.\n• Take calcium (2,000 mg daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg daily). Get enough iron in\nyour diet. (webmaster's Note: It is reported that Zinc is also very helpful in this condition.\nsee http://coldcure.com/html/zinc-angina.pdf )\n• Sprinkle a small amount of cayenne on your food, to increase circulation. Other helpful\nherbs include garlic, ginkgo, biloba extract, and pau d'arco.\n• Sunbathing is also helpful, for it strengthens both the body and the blood.\n• One physician (Donald McIntyre) suggests occasionally swinging the arms in circles, 80\ntwirls per minute, to throw blood into the hands. He says to do it as a pitcher does it:\nswinging the arm up from the back and then hard downward in front. It has been found\nthat those with back problems can swing their arms entirely in front of the body with the\nsame beneficial effect on the hands (upward in the trunk and downward to the side).\n—Also see \"Buerger's Disease.\"\nSYMPTOMS—The small arteries in the extremities constrict or tighten. The hands and feet are\nextremely sensitive to the cold, and suddenly contract. Lack of oxygenated blood causes the fingers or\ntoes to become whitish or bluish in hue. As a result, the affected area may temporarily shrink in size!\nUnless these attacks are reduced, ulcers may form, which further damage the tissue and produce chronic\ninfection under, and near, the fingernails and toenails.\nThe hands are the areas most often affected. But it can occur in the fingers and possibly toes, nose,\ntongue, cheeks, ears, or chin. The blood spasm may initially blanch the area. Tingling, and then\nswelling, may occur and become painful. The appearance may change to a bright red, as the blood\nvessels again distend and fresh blood is sent back into the area.\nThe attacks usually do not last long. But, in those instances in which they do, gangrene can develop.\nCAUSES—A cold attack is generally brought on by exposure to cold or emotional upset. The hands go\ninto the refrigerator for a moment, a difficult written exam must be taken, or a verbal conflict occurs.\nSpasms of small arteries result.\nThe underlying cause may be less easy to identify. It might be high blood pressure, drugs, connective\ntissue disease, inflammation of the arteries, or equipment vibrations which injure the blood vessels.\nSome individuals have lived in a cold, improperly heated environment for too many months or years,\nand the problem developed. Try to avoid resting or sleeping in ice cold places.\nFood allergies, junk food, or a poor diet which is high in starches and low in greens, vitamins, and\nminerals may cause it.\nApparently the cause is not a \"thoracic inlet syndrome\"; that is, squeezing of nerves or arteries issuing\nfrom the thorax by muscles or bones.\nInstead of Raynaud's, you might have Buerger's disease (a nerve disorder which gradually cuts off nerve\nsupply to the extremities). Buerger's disease is primarily caused by using tobacco products. (Buerger's is\na steady cutting off of nerve flow; whereas Raynaud's is an intermittent blood flow.)\nAntihypertensives, ergot drugs, channel blockers, or alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers can be the\ncause.\nThere are two forms of this condition:\n(1) Raynaud's phenomenon: This may be due to various bodily disorders. It occurs evenly\nin both men and women, and usually begins after the age of 30. Symptoms in the\nphenomenon may affect only one side of the body.\n(2) Raynaud's disease: This is primary disease, and occurs mainly in women. The disease\ngenerally begins in the teens or early twenties. But it can occur at any time in the life.\nAttacks normally affect both sides of the body equally.\nFrequency of the attacks are significant: They may be rare or occur as often as several times a day. Mild\noccurrences only last a few minutes; severe ones may continue for hours. Between attacks the hands will\nat first appear normal; later they may remain slightly bluish. Gradually the attacks will be more frequent\nand last longer.\nIn later years, the hands will be slightly bluish all the time. The fingers become swollen. The skin turns\npale, discolored, shiny, taut, and smooth. The nails become clubbed and deformed. In advanced stages,\npoor blood supply can weaken the fingers and damage the sense of touch. The sense of feel may\ndecrease and delicate movements become more difficult to perform. Infections and gangrene may occur\nmore frequently in the affected area.",

As soon as a corn develops, apply oil to soften it.\n• Soak your feet in very diluted chamomile tea. It will both soothe and soften the hard\nskin. (The stain the tea makes on the feet will come off easily with soap and water.) Or\njust soak the feet in comfortably hot water for several minutes. Then apply a hand cream\nwhich contains 20% urea. This will help dissolve the hard skin. Do this daily.\n• Another formula is to soak the area in a mixture of oil of wintergreen, witch hazel, and\nblack walnut tincture, daily. Use a pumice stone and emery board to trim down the corn or\ncallus.\n• Yet another formula is to crush 5-6 aspirin tablets and mix into a paste, by adding a half\nteaspoon each of water and lemon juice. Apply this to the hard-skin areas. Put the foot in a\nplastic bag, wrap a warm towel around it, and sit for 10 minutes. Then unwrap the foot\nand scrub the area with a pumice stone.

After washing them,\nrinse the socks well, to get out the detergent (which the fungus likes).\n• Put on clean socks before dressing; in this way you avoid infecting the groin area.\n• Boil socks to kill the fungus.\n• Do not use plastic or waterproof shoes. They create a warm, moist place for fungus to\nbreed. Never wear boots all day.\n• Do not wear the same shoes 2 days in a row. This gives a pair of shoes 2 days to\nthoroughly dry out.\n• Spray Lysol on a cloth and wipe the inside of the shoe.\n• Place the shoes in the sunlight, angled toward the sun. Ultraviolet light kills fungus.\n• Useful herbs are blood root and goldenseal; use alone or together.

If diabetes is\ninvolved, add chromium supplementation. Avoid excess cholesterol, sorbitol (artificial\nsweetener), unsaturated fatty acids, and mercury tooth fillings (amalgam).\n• Higher blood sugar levels in diabetics and hypoglycemics causes the cells in the lense to\nabsorb large amounts of glucose. This is converted into sorbitol, an insoluble form of\nsugar. This gradually crystallizes in the eye—forming a cataract.\n• Take chaparral tea internally.

In advanced cases, the lens is becoming opaque, so that blindness is setting in. Only part of the\neye is generally cloudy or opaque, but this can gradually extend to the entire eye.\nCAUSES—The most common cause is senility.\nCongenital cataracts occur if the mother had rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, or if the\ninfant has galactosemia (inherited inability to digest galactose [a type of milk sugar, resulting from\nlactose] properly). These cataracts generally do not get worse. Not using milk products at all can help\nprevent this in adults.\nTraumatic cataracts result from blows which rupture the anterior lens capsule, harmful chemicals,\nintense infrared radiation, or X rays. Radiation causes free radical damage in the eyes. This causes the\nlens to absorb aqueous humor. The lens becomes cloudy and must be removed, to restore eyesight.\nPeople living closer to the South Pole (which has part of its ozone layer stripped away) are more likely\nto develop cataracts.\nOther causes include hypoparathyroidism, Down's syndrome, and atopic dermatitis. The longer one has\ndiabetes, the greater the risk of cataracts.\nHair dye has been shown to cause cataracts. Only 23% of those not dying their hair get cataracts;\nwhereas 89% of those who dye their hair develop them.\nComplications of tumors, detached retina, iritis, glaucoma, and severe myopia can also bring it on.\nOther studies reveal that people with stress, allergies, or who eat seafood (thus ingesting methylmercury)\nare more likely to develop cataracts.\nIt is now known that a reduction in vitamin C or B in the diet can help produce cataracts.

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• There appears to be no evidence that restoration of vision, lost through glaucoma-caused\nnerve degeneration, can be restored. But there are things which can be done to slow or\nstop the advance of this problem.\n• Dietetic problems are among the most common causes of glaucoma. This includes\novereating, eating the wrong foods, and not eating the right ones. Emphasize a raw,\nvitamin C rich, diet.\n• Food \"allergies,\" eating foods which do not agree with the system, can be a frequent\ncause of the disease. Do a pulse test and find out which foods may be causing you\nproblems. In addition, a tonometer can be purchased, which you can use to test your\neyeball pressure.\n• The diet should include betaine HCl, vitamin C, a good vitamin/mineral supplement,\nvitamin A, vitamin B , and nourishing, natural food—but not too much of it.\n2\n• Moderate, daily out-of-door, exercise helps reduce pressure.\n• Warm fennel herb, alternated with chamomile and eyebright, is helpful. Apply as\neyewash in an eyecup or three drops to each eye, 3 times a day.\n• If anxiety seems to be a cause, increase the B complex intake. Avoid stress, worry, fear,\nand anger. Cultivate a tranquil, restful lifestyle. Great temperature changes (as found in\nthe north) are a source of stress.\n• Higher blood sugar levels increase pressure.\n• Avoid heavy lifting, pulling, etc. Avoid constipation, for straining at the stool increases\neye pressure (as does diarrhea). Maintain a slight, mild laxative effect. Avoid sitting or\nstanding still for long periods. Lying face down significantly increases pressure. Standing\non the hands astoundingly increases pressure.\n• Increased blood pressure brings increased pressure within the eyeball. Keep your blood\npressure down!\n• Do not use the eyes intensively for long periods of time (TV viewing or excessive\nreading).\n• Avoid coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and all junk and processed foods. Smoking damages\neyes which have glaucoma. Tobacco in the system increases intraocular pressure. Avoid\nspicy foods.\n• Avoid excessive fluid intake (juice, water, milk, etc.) at any one time. Drink only small\namounts, and only an hour apart.\n• Motion sickness medication patches increase eyeball pressure.\n• Those with glaucoma do well to remain under the care of a professional. Every time the\npressure increases, a little more eyesight is permanently lost.\nSYMPTOMS—Early symptoms include eye pain or discomfort mainly in the morning, blurred vision,\nhalos around light, inability to adjust to darker conditions, and peripheral (side) vision loss (resulting in\ntunnel vision).\nHigher than normal pressure within the eyeball (called intraocular pressure), it is more common in\nblacks than whites, tends to run in families, is more common in women than men, and especially affects\npeople over 40.\nCAUSES—Fluid is continually produced in the eyeball; and, just as continuously, it is draining out. The\nbalance is called intraocular pressure. Normal pressure is 15-20 millimeters of mercury, but glaucoma\nlevels may reach 40 or more. The increased pressure, unless it is relieved, will damage the optic nerve\nand produce blindness. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness. There are several types of\nglaucoma.",

In\nbetween, a solid nutritious diet, composed of lots of vegetables, seaweed, seeds, nuts,\nbeans, etc., should be eaten.\n• Vitamins A, B complex (including B , niacin, pantothenic acid), and especially vitamin\n6\nC. Calcium is also needed. A lack of manganese can cause deafness, dizziness, and ear\nnoises. A lack of magnesium can produce nerve twitching and sensitivity to noise.\n• Drink enough water.\n• Eliminate white flour products, white sugar, unsaturated fats, excess salt intake, caffeine,\nnicotine, and alcohol. An oil free diet may improve circulation in the tiny capillaries.\nSmoking induces constriction and spasm of the blood vessels. In one study, 9 out of 10\npatients improved, when placed on a low-salt diet.\n• In another study, allergies to milk, eggs, corn, wheat, and yeast sometimes caused\nMeniere's. Eliminating them essentially terminated the problem. Stop using all of the\nabove foods; then gradually reintroduce one at a time, and see which might be bothering\nyou.\n• Variations in glucose levels can prompt Meniere's. A New York study indicated that,\nwhen insulin levels are normal, the patient seldom has tinnitus, vertigo, fullness in the ear,\nor variable hearing loss.\n• Gradually increase the amount of out-of-door exercise. Breath deeply as you do it. This\nwill help the circulation in the head.\n• Use one bowl for hot water and one for cold, once or twice a day, and take a hot and cold\nhead bath. Immerse the head in the hot, for 30-60 seconds, and then plunge it into ice cold.\n(If elderly, weakened, or with a heart condition, begin with less extreme temperatures.)\n• Herbs which may help include cayenne, gotu kola, butcher's broom, ginkgo biloba, and\nginger.\n• At the time of an attack, lying quietly on the affected side, with eyes turned in the\ndirection of the affected ear may help reduce the immediate crisis.\n• If helping someone with this problem, let him move about at his own rate. Avoid jarring\nhim. When speaking to him, stand directly in front so he will not have to turn his head\n(which can add to the vertigo).\n—Also see \"Vertigo,\" and \"Tinnitus.\"\nSYMPTOMS—A disease of the inner ear, characterized by recurring episodes of ringing in the ears\n(tinnitus), loss of balance, and severe dizziness (vertigo). There is progressive deafness and a sensation\nof fullness in the ears. Sudden movement during an attack can induce nausea and vomiting. Sometimes\nthere is an uncontrollable horizontal jerking of the eyeballs.\nThe condition may affect one or both ears. It generally occurs in adults (most often in women, 50-60\nyears old). The onset is sudden. It may last for hours or weeks, and then return soon again, after years. In\nmost instances, it is experienced only in one ear, and can result in complete deafness in that ear.\nVertigo is the sensation that the world is turning around you. Meniere's syndrome accounts for 10-15%\nof all vertigo (and 5% of all dizziness).\n(Also see \"Vertigo.\")\nCAUSES—This often results from a metabolic problem, resulting from a disturbed carbohydrate\nmetabolism, such as is found in hypoglycemia.\nImpaired blood flow to the brain may be a causative factor. Those experiencing Meniere's syndrome\noften have a history of vasomotor rhinitis, ear trouble, and allergies.\nAutopsies reveal an edema in the membranous labyrinth.\nOther possible causes may include allergies, viruses, infections, and hormonal intolerances.\nSymptoms exactly like Meniere's syndrome can be caused by a cholesteatoma. This is a tumor-like\ngrowth in the middle ear, which gradually pushes on the central nervous system. Consulting with a\nspecialist might be of help in diagnosing the cause.\nIn some instances this is misdiagnosed; and it is actually salicylism, from excessive self-medication of\naspirin. That can also cause deafness, ringing in the ears, dizziness, headache, vomiting, confusion, and\nhyperventilation in the later stages. If that is the cause, stop all taking of aspirin immediately.\nFluid retention in the semicircular canals might be putting pressure on the delicate nerves of the inner\near.",

Have a hair analysis made. Find the cause\nand eliminate it. A 1981 medical study pointed to coffee, tea, tonic water, red wine, grain-\nbased spirits, chocolate, and cheese as the most common dietary causes of tinnitus.\n• Mix 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. glycerin in 1 pint warm water. Several times a day, using a\nnasal sprayer, spray each nostril until it begins draining into the back of the throat; also\nspray the throat.\n• Get a nourishing diet, and include trace minerals (Norwegian kelp or Nova Scotia dulse),\nvitamin A, calcium, magnesium, and betaine HCl.\n• A lack of manganese can cause deafness, dizziness, and ear noises. A lack of magnesium\ncan produce nerve twitching and sensitivity to noise.\n• Changing and correcting the diet, reducing stress, and getting more exercise out-of-doors\nhas been helpful in dealing with tinnitus. Stress causes more adrenaline to be produced\nwhich, in turn, constricts blood vessels and keeps waste products from being as quickly\neliminated.\n• Remember that fatigue increases the problem. An important help is to go to bed and get\nup on a regular, healthful, schedule.\n• Avoid loud noises and noisy situations. Alcohol makes tinnitus worse. Caffeine is a\ncommon cause. Marijuana and cocaine intensify the problem. Aspirin is a known cause of\ntinnitus, also blood pressure and arthritis drugs. Also beware of steroids, anticonvulsive\nmedications, vasodilators, and anticholesterol drugs. Nicotine damages the hearing.\n• Make sure the colon is working well. An enema will help with this.\n• Worthwhile herbs would include bugleweed, garlic, gotu kola, cayenne, and prickly ash.\n—Also see \"Meniere's Disease.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Sounds in the ear: ringing; whistling; roaring; hissing; chirping; buzzing; and whining\ncricket sounds, when there is no outside physical source for these sounds. At first, they come and go; in\nadvanced stages, the sound is constant. No one else hears them.\nThere are reported instances in which others have heard the sounds from as much as 4 feet from the\nperson's ear. \"Tinnitus,\" in Latin, means \"to tinkle,\" or a \"bell-like ring.\"\nThe frequency of tinnitus increases with age. The left ear seems to produce the sounds more often than\nthe right ear. About 75% of deaf people report tinnitus.\nCAUSES—There are several possible causes, including an irritation of nerve endings in the ear by loud\nnoises. Chemicals and drugs can injure the internal ear. Prescription drugs can produce tinnitus or\nhearing loss (beware of quinine and aspirin). Nicotine constricts blood vessels and may be the cause.\nOther causes are lead; aluminum; mercury poisoning; impacted wax; hormonal problems; high blood\npressure; severe blows to the head; anemia; perforation of the tympanic membrane; fluid in the middle\near; epilepsy; migraine; food allergy; Meniere's disease; hypothyroidism; multiple sclerosis; as well as\nrepeated and prolonged exposure to loud noises. Whatever the cause, stress sometimes adds to it.\nTinnitus is not a sign of a more serious problem or a precursor of any serious disease—unless it is\nassociated with Meniere's Disease (which see).",

It is also called pyorrhea, or gum disease. Gingivitis (which see) is\ninflammation of the gums, an early stage of periodontal disease.\nThe explanation given by many medical-dental professionals for periodontal disease is that plaque\n(sticky deposits of mucous, food particles, and bacteria) adheres to the teeth and gradually accumulates.\nThis plaque causes the gums to become infected and swollen. That infection (called gingivitis), leads to\npyorrhea (also called periodontitis) in which the bone underlying the teeth is eroded away by the\ninfection.\nThe other explanation is that much of what is known as pyorrhea is primarily caused by an inadequate\nintake of calcium, copper, vitamins D and C; by the eating of processed, and junk, food; and by erosion\nof acids, placed in the mouth.

The professional explanation for the problem is that the wearers do\nnot take proper care of them, and that the gums periodically change shape, etc.\nThere is another, less-known, reason: When the decision is made to extract teeth and fit an individual for\ndentures, the teeth are pulled out and the molds prepared for the false teeth. The entire process is done as\nquickly as possible, so teeth will appear to be in the mouth again as soon as possible. In addition, it is a\nconvenience to the dentist to take the molds the same day that the extractions were done.\nBut when the extractions are made, the gums understandably swell! A number of sizeable wounds have\nbeen made in the mouth, and the gums are swollen and inflamed. That is not the time to take the molds.\nInstead, the person should wait at least one week for the gums to heal and readjust into their normal post-\ndental sizes and shapes. Then those molds should be made.\nIf your dentist tells you that you need all your teeth pulled out, discuss the matter with him and perhaps\ncheck with another dentist or two. Very often only certain teeth need be removed and a bridge can be\ninstalled, which locks onto the teeth which remain. This is far better than wearing dentures. Do all you\ncan to keep your teeth.\nLIVING WITH DENTURES—\n• Practice speaking. By yourself, read aloud from books and learn how to articulate\nvowels, consonants, and various combinations.\n• Temporary denture adhesives may be necessary when you are first getting used to your\nnew dentures. But you should not need to rely on adhesives all the time. The dentures\nshould fit properly. Do not let the dentist take molds too soon.\n• When you can, take out the dentures so the gums can rest.\n• Begin by eating soft foods, and gradually get used to chewing with dentures.\n• After each meal, scrub the dentures with soap and lukewarm water. Wash your gums\ngently with a soft toothbrush, to remove the plaque.\n• Massage your gums every day.

    "title": "Hiccup",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• A high blood carbon-dioxide level is known to stifle hiccups. A well-known procedure is\nto breathe into a paper bag. Blow in and out exactly 10 times, and do it very hard until you\nare red in the face. You must do it fast, and you must form a good seal around the bag so\nno air gets in.\nHold your breath as long as you can, and then swallow when you think a hiccup is\ncoming. Do that 2-3 times. Then take a deep breath and begin again.\n• Hold your breath in for as long as possible, then exhale and hold that as long as possible.\n• Blow air out in a slow, steady stream.\n• Hold your breath, while extending your head as far backward as you can.\n• Swallow a teaspoonful of sugar, dry. It often stops the hiccups in minutes. The sugar in\nthe mouth probably sends different signals along the nerve routes, interfering with the\nhiccups.\n• Close your mouth, hold your nose and ears closed with your fingers and thumbs, and\nswallow 3 times before you let go. This creates a slight vacuum and changes the rhythm of\nthe diaphragm enough to bring relief.\n• Chew and swallow ice for 10-15 minutes.\n• Stand behind the person as he sits on a chair. Grasp the neck gently with your fingers\nand, with the thumbs, slowly massage down each side of the spinous process.\n• Fill a glass of water, bend over forward, and drink the water upside down.\n• Apply pressure with the flat of the hand, just below the breastbone.\n• Take a deep breath and drink 10 swallows of water while not breathing.\n• Put ice on the neck.\n• Drink catnip tea.\n• Place light fingertip pressure on each side of the neck, for about a minute.\n• When you are eating, just be quiet and eat, and you are not likely to get hiccups.\n• Take exactly 10 sips of water in rapid succession.\n• A sneeze sometimes stops the hiccups.\n• Have someone pull on your tongue.\n• Lie on the left side for 10-15 minutes.\n• Stand on your head.\n• Swallow crushed ice.\n• Deep breathing.\n• Have someone massage your feet.\n• Drink a half glassful of fresh orange juice.\n• Take a hot bath for 15 minutes.\n• Place an ice bag to the pit of the stomach.\n• Bend at the waist, to touch the toes, and hold this position for about 60 seconds. This\nmethod is useful for both adults and children.\n• When children run around and play, sometimes one ends up with the hiccups. When that\nhappens, try tickling him while he holds his breath, and tell him to try real hard not to\nlaugh. He will forget about the hiccups.\n• In case you have hiccups which will not stop, go on a 3 day complete fast.\n(Hiccough)\nSYMPTOMS—Hiccups that you want to have stopped.\nCAUSES—Charles Osborne of Anthon, Iowa, started hiccuping in 1922 and hiccuped for the next 65\nyears. After 430 million hiccups, he passed away.\nAlmost all hiccups are one-sided; that is, only one side of the diaphragm contracts. Overeating or\nexcessive drinking is the most common cause. It causes the stomach to extend downward and press\nagainst the diaphragm—which then starts its hiccuppy motions.\nA hiccup is a repeated involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, immediately followed by a\nsudden closure of the glottis.\nBut that information does not help solve the problem. Here is advice that may. All of these methods\nreally work for some people. See what is best for you. (You will notice that these techniques are\nfrequently based on diverting attention, changing the ongoing physical hiccup pattern, and getting the\nbody to do something different for a few moments.)",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Make a habit of not gulping down air as you eat. Just thinking about being more careful\nwill help a lot.\n• Chew with your mouth closed, and do not talk while you are eating.\n• Do not eat foods which produce gas, such as beans, carbonated drinks, and beer.\n• Do not drink out of cans, bottles, or through a straw.\n• Avoid foods with high air content. This includes ice cream, beer, omelets, and whipped\ncream.\n—Also see \"Bloating.\"\n(Eructation)\nSYMPTOMS—Burping up air from the stomach.\nCAUSES—Belching is most frequently caused by bringing up air that was swallowed with the food and\ndrink taken in. This is called aerophagia.\nWe normally have about a cupful of air in our stomach all the time. Every day, we swallow air and make\nsome in our stomach (about 10 cupfuls in 24 hours).

    "title": "Bloating",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• You may wish to take 1 oz of oral hydrogen peroxide (20 drops/oz) twice a day, along\nwith colloidal minerals, betaine HCl (hydrochloride), and pancreatic enzymes, 75-200 mg,\nthree times a day. Take this 15 minutes before mealtime.\n• Instead of that, you can take lemon juice and water before each meal. In your stomach,\nthe lemon juice will act similarly to that of HCl.\n• At the time of the bloating, this can be done: If the bloating is in the stomach, seat the\nperson upright, apply heat over the stomach. Have him sip hot water.\n• If the bloating is in the intestines, have him lie down for a half hour before, and after,\nmeals. Give no fluids with meals, but hot water may be sipped afterward. If needed, give\nan enema.\n• Avoid gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, other members of the cabbage\nfamily, and whole wheat flour products.\n• To reduce gas-causing sulfur compounds in beans (garbanzo, pinto, navy, etc.), use the\nfollowing cooking method: Place 1 cup of beans in 5 cups of water and bring to a boil.\nBoil for one minute. Then drain the beans and add 5 cups of fresh water. Bring the water\nto a boil and continue cooking the beans according to directions.\n• Avoid lactose. Eating dairy foods can produce gas in the large bowels.\n• It is possible to eat too much fiber at a time. This can induce some bloating.\n• Take charcoal, to help reduce the gas. The charcoal will adsorb it and carry it off.\nActivated charcoal is best.\n• People who sigh often swallow air.\n• Avoid tight belts and tight-fitting clothes. Those who do not wear belts and girdles have\nless indigestion.\n• Do not postpone bowel movements.\n• Avoid drinking at water fountains. You can hardly drink at one without gulping down\nair.\n• A low-fat diet helps reduce carbon-dioxide production in the top (duodenal) area of the\nsmall intestines.\n• Artificial sweeteners produce gas.\n• Drink enough water. A dry mouth encourages swallowing.\n• Avoid repetitive belching, for you tend to swallow more air than you release.\n• Both chewing gum and smoking increase the swallowing of air.\n• Carbonated drinks (beer, champagne, soft drinks) and foods with whipped air cause\nmore food to be ingested.\n• Avoid drinking with meals.\n• To expel excess air, rock back and forth in the knee-chest position.\n—Also see \"Stomach Distension, Gaseous,\" \"Belching,\" \"Achlorhydria,\" \"Dyspepsia,\" and \"Colic in\nChildren.\"\n(Flatulence; Gas)\nSYMPTOMS—There is an excess of gas in the stomach. The stomach (or intestines) seems to be too\nfull.\nCAUSES—Bloating is the accumulation of gas in the stomach, intestines, or bowels. Normally the\nstomach is sterile because of the acid environment. But when it does not contain enough hydrochloric\nacid (\"Achlorhydria,\" which see), bacteria from the small intestine migrates up into the stomach.\nArriving there, it ferments the carbohydrates and sugars which are there. This produces gas or, what is\ncalled, bloat.",

    "title": "Hiatal Hernia",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• As soon as you sense heartburn coming on, drink 1-2 large glasses of water. This tends\nto wash the acid back down into the stomach.\n• Eat nourishing food, plus vitamin/mineral supplements. Several small meals are best.\nAvoid overeating; it only intensifies the problem. Supper, if eaten at all, should be light\nand 2-3 hours before bedtime. Food in the stomach, after you are in bed, is more likely to\nflow back up into the windpipe. Stop eating supper entirely, and you are more likely to\nhave success in overcoming hiatal hernia.\n• Include extra fiber; this helps soak up some of the acid.\n• Avoid fried food and fats; they slow down the digestion process in the stomach. Do not\ntake tea, coffee, colas, alcohol, or tobacco. Avoid refined foods, including white-flour\nproducts and sugar.\n• Avoid coffee, chocolate, spicy foods, alcohol, tomatoes, mint foods, whole milk, and\npossibly citrus juices.\n• Avoid constipation by including fiber in the diet.\n• Eat your meals on a regular schedule, and do not eat between meals. Eating between\nmeals causes the stomach to stop partway through, and start all over again—still with\neverything from the previous meal in it.\n• Even when not thirsty, drink a large glass of water every so often throughout the day.\n• Avoid heavy lifting, and do not bend over more than you have to. Wait till 2 hours after\na meal before starting heavy exertion.\n• Bend from the knees, not from the waist, to avoid upward pressure on the stomach.\n• Daily outdoor exercise will strengthen the muscles.\n• Avoid stress and stressful situations.\n• Avoid tight clothing (corsets, girdles, belts, etc.)\n• You may need to raise the head of the bed 4-8 inches to avoid reflux of food upward at\nnight.\n—Also see \"Hernia\" and \"Umbilical Hernia.\"\n(Hiatus Hernia)\nSYMPTOMS—Heartburn and belching. There may be difficulty in swallowing. Material from the\nstomach may suddenly return into the throat or mouth, causing a burning sensation. It may feel as if\nthere is a lump in the throat, or that food is sticking at a point in the throat. Sometimes bloody mucous is\ncoughed up.\nCAUSES—The stomach pushes, or herniates, upward through an opening in the diaphragm into the\nchest cavity (the thorax). A weakness in the diaphragm as it leaves the esophagus may enlarge the\nopening, where the esophagus (food pipe) enters the stomach. This enables the stomach to slide up\nsomewhat.\nThe weakness is often caused by increased pressure upward, from what is in or near the abdominal\ncavity: obesity, pregnancy, tumors, heavy lifting, overeating, straining at the stool, or tight clothing.\nIt is said that nearly half the people over 40, in the U.S., have hiatal hernias. But most are unaware of it,\nsince these hernias are often quite small and are hardly noticed. They occur in women four times as\noften as in men, perhaps due to tight clothing. They generally first occur after the age of 40.\nThe acid material that comes up into the windpipe, from the larger hernias, frequently causes ulceration\nin the esophageal wall.\nBut ulcers can also occur in the duodenum, which is the top part of the small intestine, just below the\nstomach.\nPeople with this condition have a tendency to have overacid stomachs.\nBetween the esophagus and stomach is the esophageal sphincter. This is a circular valve which can open\nand close. But its strength is damaged by drugs, tobacco (smoked or chewed), or certain foods. This\nweakening allows food and acid to go back up into the windpipe.\nThose certain foods include coffee and chocolate (because of the methylxanthines in them), spicy foods,\ntomato, alcohol, peppermint, spearmint, and citrus juices. Tobacco and coffee are especially bad. Whole\nmilk can also be a problem. Weakening of the sphincter occurs within 30 minutes after drinking coffee.\nOne puff of a cigarette can lower sphincter pressure to zero; the result is called \"smoker's heartburn.\"",

    "title": "Vomiting",
    "contentEn": "(Emesis)\nSYMPTOMS—The person vomits.\nCAUSES—The cause is often overeating, eating the wrong food, poor combinations, or excessive\nalcohol consumption. But it can also be caused by food allergies, poisoning, food poisoning, or infection\n(flu, Epstein-Barr syndrome, candida, etc.) If the vomitus (that which comes up) looks like \"coffee\ngrounds,\" it includes large amounts of blood from a bleeding ulcer or stomach cancer. This is an\nemergency, for extensive internal bleeding can result in death. Take him to the emergency room.\nIf it occurs in infants, accompanied by fever and the child is unresponsive, it could indicate meningitis.\nCall a physician immediately. (See meningitis.)\nBut it might be that you need to induce vomiting, after someone eats a poisonous plant, rat poison, etc.\nTO ASSIST VOMITING TO OCCUR—If you have eaten something poisonous or are having a\ngallbladder attack, an emetic will help. Drink an emetic herb tea. Lobelia is probably the best. Make an\nherb tea of lobelia or peach leaves, and take a teaspoonful every 15 minutes for 3-4 hours.\nEMETIC HERBS—When giving lobelia tea, give the full dose all at once or you will not induce\nvomiting. Add 1 oz lobelia to a quart of boiling water; let it steep for 5-10 minutes if you are in a hurry\n(15-20 minutes is better). Then give a cup or two of the liquid (not hot), and let him vomit.\nOther emetic herbs include bayberry bark, myrica, white willow, and ragwort.\nIn his book, Back to Eden (see order sheet), p. 260, Kloss gives a complicated formula for giving herbs\nto help a person vomit. You might wish to refer to it.\nTO STOP VOMITING—Give very small doses of lobelia; it will relax the person and the vomiting\nwill cease. Use a teaspoon of boiling water, steep, take a teaspoonful of this every 15 minutes, until\nrelief is obtained. A cup of hot peppermint or spearmint tea, taken after the stomach has been cleaned\nout, will also help settle it. Catnip or sweet balm are also useful. A hot fomentation over the stomach, or\na hot water bottle with a moist towel under it, will help settle the stomach.\nAFTER VOMITING—Do not eat for several hours, but carefully take fluids, as you are able.\nYou lose a lot of fluid when you vomit. Be sure and replace it. Drink water, do not become dehydrated.\nThose fluids should be clear: water, weak tea, or fruit juices. Milk and heavy soups may be too much for\nthe stomach just then.\nDrink small amounts of peppermint tea.\nVomiting also flushes out minerals. These need to be replaced with electrolyte drinks, clear soups, or\napple or cranberry juice. If only water, add a couple pinches of sugar and salt to it. After vomiting, it is\nbest to sip the fluids, then pause, then sip a little more; do not gulp them down. Do not drink cold fluids;\nit is a shock to the weakened stomach. Do not drink carbonated products at this time.\nWhen you are ready to eat, start back with a small carbohydrate meal, such as rice soup. Avoid fatty\nsubstances, for they would remain in the tired stomach too long.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Do not eat when you are in a hurry or under stress. You should be able to relax when you\neat. Do not eat when you are upset or excessively tired. Do not drink liquids with your\nmeal, for this dilutes your stomach juices. Take time to chew your food thoroughly.\n• Eat more live (raw) foods rather than primarily heavily cooked items. Fresh, raw foods\nare rich in enzymes that help digest and assimilate the nutrients. But those enzymes are\ndestroyed when heated to more than 120o F. All processed foods have been heated above\n120o F.\n• Cut down on the meat or eliminate it entirely. It is very hard to digest, and frequently\ncarries bacteria and parasites.\n• Be sure and include enough fiber in your meal. Otherwise you are more likely to have\nconstipation, with consequent absorption of toxins back into the system.\n• Include trace minerals in the diet (in Norway kelp and Nova Scotia dulse), and obtain\nadequate vitamin and mineral supplementation. If you are having a difficult time\nabsorbing your food, you need to maintain good supplementation all the more.\nSwallowing air (by chewing with the mouth open or talking while chewing) can cause\nindigestion.\n• First thing in the morning, juice a lemon and and drink it in a cup of water. This will\nhelp prepare your stomach for its daily duties.\n• Ginger is good, to lessen digestive nausea.\n• Catnip, chamomile, fennel, and peppermint are all helpful in reducing indigestion. Mint\ntea calms the stomach.\n• Papain, papaya (containing the digestive enzyme papain), and fresh pineapple\n(containing another digestive enzyme, bromelin) are also very helpful.\n• Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D are needed.\n• English bitters are very helpful. Take them before each meal.\n• Helpful herbs include balm, bitter orange, celandine, hops, fennel, and yarrow.\n• Alcohol; vinegar; caffeine; and spicy, refined, or greasy foods promotes indigestion.\n• Food allergies, such as lactose intolerance, can cause it also, so locate them. (See\nAllergies.) Avoid foods which tend to bother you. Take the pulse test in order to determine\nyours. (See Pulse Test.)\n• Do not eat too heavily of legumes, especially lentils, peanuts, and soybeans. They\ncontain a substance which slows down certain digestive enzymes.\n• Avoid these food combinations: milk and sugar, fruits and vegetables, sugar and protein.\n• Take an out-of-door walk after breakfast. If you can, do it where the air is fresh, not by a\nhighway.\n• Keep in mind Kouchadoff's discovery. This Russian scientist experimented with cooked\nfood and found that, when it was eaten, the white blood cells increased rapidly in the\nsmall intestine. As part of our immune system, they increase to fight hostile invaders. In\nother words, when your white blood cell count goes up, a threatened infection or disease is\nbeing prepared for.\n• Eating raw foods protects the immune system, and does not cause an increase in white\nblood cell count.\n• Dr. Bircher-Benner, of Switzerland, discovered that eating raw food at a meal before\ncooked food prevented the formation of white cells in the intestines. Therefore, he always\nserved raw salads before cooked foods.\n—Now, for the other side of the coin:\n• There is a theory which some accept and others reject. Consider this:\n• A major cause of indigestion is eating salads and other light food at the beginning of the\nmeal, and waiting till partway through the meal to eat the protein foods. But protein foods\nneed lots of HCl for proper digestion; the other foods do not. So begin your meal with\nyour protein foods. You can eat salads with your protein food, but not before it.\n• Which theory is correct? The truth may be in the middle: Those who have an abundance\nof HCl tend to do better eating some protein at the beginning of the meal, and those who\ndo not have as much do better eating the raw foods, to begin with.\n—Also see \"Nervous Dyspepsia,\" \"Bloating,\" \"Achlorhydria,\" \"Allergies,\" and \"Pulse Test.\"\n(Poor Digestion; Indigestion)\nSYMPTOMS—Gas, a bloated feeling, rumbling noises, belching, possibly a burning feeling, and\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—The main causes are dietary habits and stress. Lack of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and enzymes\nare other major causes. Lack of enzymes keep vitamins and minerals from being used properly.\nInadequate HCl means the protein food will not be digested correctly.\nOther contributing factors include peptic ulcers. Intestinal obstruction can also lead to indigestion. If the\nliver, pancreas, or gallbladder are not function properly, it is more difficult for the body to digest food.\nA key factor can be hydrochloric acid production (see Achlorhydria).\nIf food does not digest properly, it tends to ferment in the intestines. This produces hydrogen and carbon-\ndioxide gas, which causes bloating and pain. (See Bloating.)",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• With only supportive care, the acute symptoms will fade. But some will continue to have\nchronic symptoms arising so often, for months or years. This is called chronic relapsing\npancreatitis.\n• It is wise to do everything possible to avoid the chronic condition or, if it is has begun,\ntry to clear it up as much as possible.\n• Fast and take only water until the acute symptoms subside. Food in the stomach triggers\nthe pancreas to start working, and this you do not want just now.\n• Give slippery elm enemas. Cut the slippery elm bark into very small pieces, and put a\nlarge handful in 4 quarts of water. Simmer for 1-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Then let it\nset, covered for 30 minutes. Strain and use it warm. Drink it and use in enemas.\n• Place a heaping teaspoonful of lobelia in a cup of boiling water and let it steep for a half\nhour; then add a tablespoon of this lobelia tea to each cup of slippery elm tea, and drink.\nAlso drink a cup a hour before each meal and before retiring. This will both relax and\ncleanse the digestive tract.\n• After coming off the fast because the acute phase is over, eat a low calorie, low fat diet.\nIn chronic pancreatitis, that organ often no longer produces lipase normally. Without it,\nfats cannot be properly handled by the body. So eat a low fat diet for the rest of your life.\n• Go on a low sugar diet. A heavy diet of refined carbohydrates can cause pancreatitis.\n• Say good-bye to all alcoholic beverages, and also to caffeine.\n• Avoid overeating. This also overworks the pancreas.\n• There are no medications which can solve this problem. Indeed, it was medications\nwhich may have led to it; continuing to take them may only intensify the disease.\n• Even though total pancreatactomy may be recommended, avoid surgery. It will probably\nonly worsen the condition.\n• In case of a very serious acute crisis, give frequent hot steam pack fomentations to the\nabdomen. Give charcoal internally, and apply it as a poultice over the affected area. Place\nthe person on a strict program of what he eats and drinks.\nSYMPTOMS—Acute cases: A sudden attack of severe burning or stabbing pain in the upper abdomen,\npossibly accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain may spread to the back and is made worse by\nmoving. Food, alcohol, and vomiting may worsen the pain.\nChronic cases: The pain is milder and pain attacks do not come on suddenly. There is excessive gas,\nmuscle aches, and fever. Permanent damage to the pancreas can occur, because the constant\ninflammation can produce fibrosis in that organ. The chronic state results in irreversible changes in the\ngallbladder.\nOther symptoms of pancreatitis include abdominal swelling and distension, hypertension, sweating, and\nabnormal fatty stools.\nDiabetes, digestive problems, and cancer can also result, as well as hearing, respiratory, and kidney\nfailure.\nCAUSES—Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Normal cells are replaced with scar tissue and\ncalcium deposits. It frequently produces mild diabetes.\nThe most frequent causes of pancreatitis are drinking alcohol, viral infection, and diseases of the bile\nducts or gallbladder. A diet rich in fats and meat lays a solid foundation for pancreatitis to occur. Other\ncauses include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, and a considerable variety of prescribed\nmedications. Oral contraceptives, steroids, estrogen, and ACTH can also do it.\nTo this list should be added abdominal injury, obesity, poor nutrition, and electric shock.\nCertain diseases can also induce it: hepatitis, mumps, and possibly anorexia nervosa.\nThe pancreas produces two important hormones: insulin and glucagon; both of which regulate blood\nsugar levels and aid digestion.

Plenty of water is also needed.\n• Carefully dispose of all his discharges, so as not to contaminate anything.\n• Do everything possible to exterminate rats.\n• Avoid swimming in, or contact with, water that may be contaminated with animal waste.\n(Weil's Disease, Leptospirosis, Spirochetal Jaundice)\nSYMPTOMS—Sudden fever, chills, anemia, jaundice, sometimes abdominal pains, and occasionally\naseptic meningitis.\nWithin a few hours, fever, extreme thirst, and severe aching of the limbs develop. Blood vessels in the\neyeballs markedly enlarged. Jaundice appears in about half the cases. In locations where the disease is\ncommon, mortality is about 10-20%.\nThis disease can easily be diagnosed as something else. It is important to determine the true nature of the\ninfection early.\nCAUSES—This is an infectious disease caused by the leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, a spirochete\nbacteria. Rats, dogs, and various wild animals carry it. People are infected when urine-contaminated\nwater (generally from rats) penetrates cuts on their fingers or during butchering and skinning of infected\nanimals. The rats are not harmed by the disease.\nLeptospire is a parasite which travels to the liver and greatly multiplies there, but can also be found in\nthe blood (in the early stages) and in the urine (later). Blood tests or urine cultures are necessary for\ndiagnosis.",

But those medications are forbidden in Japan and Sweden,\nbecause they can cause severe nerve and eye damage.\n• Instead, take betaine hydrochloride (betaine HCl) tablets with you when you travel, and\nswallow two tablets after each meal. The hydrochloric acid will kill bacteria in the\nstomach and help prevent infection.\n• Straight lemon or lime juice, taken on an empty stomach, also has an sterilizing effect.\n• To make the situation even better, eat some raw garlic with your meals.\n• In cases of non-bacterial diarrhea, 3 tbsp. of raw, unprocessed wheat bran daily, taken in\nfruit juice, has been found to give relief.\nHere are more ideas for preventing turista from happening to you:\n• Drink acidic drinks, such as fruit juice or whatever else you can get overseas. If you\ncannot do better, drink carbonated beverages sealed in bottles or cans.\n• Try to make sure the dishes and eating utensils have been cleaned in purified water, and,\nhopefully, rinsed in very hot water.\n• Avoid uncooked vegetables. This includes salads, fruits you cannot peel, ice cubes, and\nanything that unpurified water is in.\n• Boil water for 3-5 minutes to purify it. Iodine liquid or tablets purifies it also.\nThere is danger, when traveling overseas (or even if you remain at home) that the diarrhea may indicate\nsomething more serious:\n• Abdominal bloating, vomiting, and pain can point to colitis, appendicitis, or an intestinal\nobstruction.\n• Black or red stools can indicate bleeding or a parasitic infection.\n• White or pale stools can signify disease of the liver.\n• If fever occurs with the diarrhea, then a serious infection may be involved.\n• Amoebic dysentery is a serious problem in Mexico, Central America, and a number of\nother places. If you contract it, garlic, goldenseal, colchicum, peppermint, and ginger have\nbeen used successfully against it. When in doubt, burn a wooden box, gather the charcoal\ntogether and swallow it in water.\nHere are other homemade ways to eliminate diarrhea:\n• Take dried blueberries with you. They tend to constipate and thus eliminate the diarrhea.\nBlackberry root is equally good. Make it into a tea and drink it.\n• Plantain is strongly astringent, so is white oak bark.\n• Cook down apple peels and drink it. The pectin in it helps eliminate diarrhea.\n• Tannic acid is in acorns and oak bark. It is a powerful astringent, and will stop the\nmuscular contractions of the intestines.\n• Not only charcoal, but clay is also useful in stopping diarrhea. Many commercial\nantidiarrheal preparations contain clay.\n—Also see \"Diarrhea and Dysentery.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Diarrhea when traveling in foreign countries, otherwise you may not feel sick.\nCAUSES—Hygienic conditions and bacterial flora are different in other countries. The nationals are\nused to it; but, arriving in that strange land, it can be too much for you.\nOne problem is foreign versions of the escherichia coli bacteria. Foreign versions produce a toxin that\nprevents your intestines from absorbing the water you ingest in food and drink. The result is diarrhea.\nSalmonella and shigella bacteria can also produce turista, and a smaller number of cases are caused by\nrotavirus or the giardia parasite.\nUp to 50% of turista cases are unexplained, but suspicion is pointed to fatigue, changes in diet, jet lag,\nand altitude sickness.\nSeasoned travelers say that there is a 50% chance you will get diarrhea if you visit overseas, even if you\ntake the recommended precautions.

Wheat products may do it also.\n• Poorly digested roughage can be the problem. Chew your food well. Your intestines\nneed fiber, but not chunks of food.\n• Undigested cereals and carbohydrates are another cause. Take digestive enzymes and\nsmaller, more frequent, meals.\n• Use the pulse test, to ascertain whether allergic foods are being eaten. (See \"Pulse Test.\")\n• When no open peptic or intestinal ulcers are present, take 2-3 tablets of betaine\nhydrochloride (betaine HCl) after each meal with a glass of water. This will help the\nstomach digest proteins and carbohydrates.\n• Slippery elm is very soothing and healing to the bowel.

Diverticula are often\nproduced.\nCAUSES—Colitis is a disease of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis is a more severe variation of it.\nThe symptoms and treatment of both are about the same.\nColitis is a chronic infection of the lower bowel. The mucous membrane wall becomes irritated as a\nresult of fecal matter which has accumulated, because of constipation. In other words, the person did not\nhave regular bowel movements, and so the bowel wall became infected as a result.\nOver-the-counter laxatives, cooking in aluminum utensils, overeating of refined carbohydrates, too\nmuch sugar in the diet, and food allergies are other causes.\nConstipation causes the person to strain. This produces diverticula (see \"Diverticulitis\"), small pockets\nwhich fill with waste matter and toxins.\nLow-fiber diets, wrong food combinations, and poor bowel habits—all work together to cause trouble.\nToxic bacteria multiplies quickly when retained in the lower bowel too long.\nNervous tension and emotional stress intensifies the problem.\nAntibiotics change the intestinal flora, and that can also produce colitis.\nIt is important that you try to find the underlying cause of the colitis, otherwise it will be difficult to\neliminate it.\nMore rarely, the intestinal wall weakens, balloons out, and could possibly rupture. This is called toxic\nmagacolon.",

Do not use sugar or sugar foods. One study revealed that\npatients contracting Crohn's disease had previously been eating more sugar than the\naverage population. Eat high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrates (whole grains). However,\ngradually increase the fiber content, all the while chewing well, so as not to irritate the GI\ntract. If you cannot chew well, then blend the food.\n• Individuals who contracted Crohn's disease were found to have eaten few raw fruits and\nvegetables prior to developing the condition.\n• Mainly eat nonacidic fresh or cooked vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, carrots,\ncelery, kale, garlic, and Brussels sprouts. Never fry anything.\n• Avoid overeating, in order to reduce the inflammation of the GI wall.\n• Gluten tends to make the problem worse. So avoid gluten-containing grains (which are\nwheat, oats, rye, barley, and buckwheat). Remarkable results can be obtained, but the\ngluten-free diet must be strictly adhered to; not even tiny amounts in the diet may be\npermitted.\n• Lactose intolerance is frequent. Avoid all milk products.\n• Eliminate all possible food allergies and other allergies. Crohn's patients tend to have\nallergic conditions, such as hay fever and eczema.\n• Regularly obtain sunshine and fresh air.\n• Avoid stress, anxiety, and worry. Keep calm and relaxed. Avoid even exciting,\ncompetitive games.\n• Charcoal will help control the diarrhea. Take 4-6 tablets, 2-3 times a day between meals.\nIf the charcoal irritates the colon, stir the charcoal into water, let the charcoal settle to the\nbottom, and only drink the apparently clear top part.\n• Make sure the bowels move daily.\n• Surgary, antidiarrheal drugs, and corticosteroids should be avoided. They worsen the\ncondition rather than improving it. A full 50% of those who undergo surgery report a\nrapid increase in symptoms afterward.\n• Helpful herbs are black walnut, burdock, goldenseal, pau d'arco, psyllium, saffron, aloe\nvera, fenugreek, slippery elm, and white oak bark.\n—Also see \"Ulcerative Colitis.\"\n(Regional Enteritis; Ulcerative Colitis)\nSYMPTOMS—Loss of energy, appetite, and weight. Chronic diarrhea, fever, chronic rectal bleeding,\nmalabsorption, pain in the entire abdomen, excess fat in the stool (resulting in pale, bulky stools that\nfloat). Malnutrition results.\nCAUSES—Crohn's disease is also known as regional enteritis. Ulcerative colitis is a different disorder,\nbut similar enough in symptoms and treatment that we will list them together.\nThe difference is that ulcerative colitis only involves the first two layers of the intestinal wall (the\nmucosa and submucosa); whereas Crohn's disease also affects the next two layers (the connective tissue\nand the wall muscles).\nCrohn's disease is a chronic ulceration of one or more sections of the digestive tract. Three special facts\nare (1) the ulceration reaches into all layers of the gastro-intestinal (GI) wall, (2) the entire GI tract can\nbe involved, from mouth to the anus, and (3) this is usually a long-lasting condition.\nAs the inflamed portions heal, scar tissue remains, which keeps narrowing the channel.\nMany puzzles still surround this condition. The origin is not clearly understood, and certain racial groups\ncontract it more than others (Jews have it more than anyone else).\nBut certain facts stand out:\nFood food allergies may help it start, and identifying and avoiding them helps reduce it.\nA lack of vitamins C and E in the diet aggravates the problem.\nPeople in Europe and North America have it far more than those living elsewhere in the world.\nJews in America have it much more than Jews in Israel. Caucasians have it less often than Jews, but\nmore often than other races.\nTherefore it is likely that the modern, Western, diet is a significant factor. Eating simple, nourishing\nfood is an important aspect of dealing with this problem.\nRarely does the disease strike once and go away. Most of the time it recurs for years. When this\nhappens, the ongoing scarring keeps reducing bowel functions.\nIf ignored, eventually Crohn's disease can lead to cancer.\nNo definite cure is known, but certain things tend to alleviate the problem.\nIt is believed that Crohn's disease is an autoimmune problem; that is, the GI tract has become so toxic\nfrom years of mistreatment, that the immune system becomes confused and begins attacking the part of\nthe body housing the toxic food.",

Psyllium seed and flaxseed also help soften the stools.\n• Have a bowel movement when you sense you ought to. Do not wait.\n• Obtain adequate exercise, especially out-of-doors.\n• Prunes, pureed fruit juices, and herb teas are very helpful.\n• Carrot, beet, celery, and green juices are excellent. Of the fruit juices, papaya, apple,\npineapple, and lemon are outstanding for your purposes.\n• Chew nuts, seeds, and popcorn well, so they will be less likely to enter the diverticula.\n• Eat smaller meals.\n• Rats placed on high-fat diets, for 90 weeks, all developed colon diverticula.\n• Avoid caffeine products. They all tend to irritate the colon.\n• Do not eat a lot of sugar.\n• Smoking and stress make the symptoms worse.\n• Girdles, belts, and tight bands around the waist tend to increase abdominal pressure on\nthe colon.\n• Helpful herbs include slippery elm, peppermint, chamomile, and aloe vera.\nDURING AN ATTACK—As soon as an attack begins, give yourself a cleansing enema (2 quarts of\nwater and the juice of a fresh lemon). Take 4 charcoal tablets with a large glass of water.\nIn case of pain or spasm in the colon, apply a heating pad over the abdomen.\nDuring the acute phase of an attack, it may be best to eat a low-fiber diet for a short time.

Stand up and stretch.\nTry to have bowel movements on schedule. Take fiber first thing in the morning, and down a quart of\nwater before breakfast.\nCheck your stools daily. If they are black, this means blood is present; take a sample to a physician.\nSYMPTOMS—No symptoms until they become infected or inflamed, resulting in chills, fever, and\npain. The pain may be localized in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and may be constant.\nSometimes there is a brief period of diarrhea.\nCAUSES—Diverticula are small pouch-like sacs on the inside of the large bowel, generally in the\ndescending colon. When a person is constipated, he tends to push too hard. The air pressure exerted by\nthis muscular squeeze on the bowel muscles can force small pockets to form in the walls of the lower\ncolon.\nOnce they form, diverticula never go away. Of themselves, they provide no symptoms. The problem is\nthat fecal matter can collect in them and eventually attract bacteria. This results in infection or\ninflammation, which produces the fever, chills, and pain.\nDiverticulosis is when you have diverticula. It is basically symptomless. Diverticulitis is when they are\ninflamed or infected; then the unfortunate symptoms reveal themselves.\nThis is another disease caused by \"civilized\" refined and junk foods.

Breast-feed the child, to avoid using cow's\nmilk.\n• Do not overeat sugar or white-flour products.\n• Eat a nourishing diet, including fresh fruit and vegetables, and vegetable juices. Fiber is\nimportant in the diet of celiacs.\n• Allisatin, found in garlic, is said to help treat celiac disease.\n• Ripe bananas are tolerated well, and help control the diarrhea.\n• Avoid processed, fried, and junk food. Do not eat sugary foods, chocolate, and processed\nfoods.\n• Read the labels, and watch for \"hidden\" gluten or cow's milk ingredients in bottles and\npackages. Some of these are malt, modified food starch, some soy sauces, garin vinegars,\nbinders, fillers, excipients, and \"natural flavorings.\" Almost all commercial breads, bread\nmixes, crackers, etc., contain gluten.

Also see \"Crohn's\nDisease.\"\n(Celiac Sprue, Gluten Intolerance)\nSYMPTOMS—Diarrhea, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies such as anemia. Other symptoms\ninclude frequently pale and/or light-yellow, foul-smelling stools that float; fatigue; depression;\nabdominal swelling; muscle cramps; wasting; and bone and/or joint pain. Diarrhea is the most\ncommonly observed symptom.\nInfants and children may show vomiting; stunted growth; intense burning sensation of the skin; and a\nred, itchy skin rash. Ulcers may develop in the mouth. The child may look anemic and undernourished.\nBabies may lose weight or gain it more slowly, and do not seem to be thriving well. The disease can\nbegin in the first few months of life.\nCAUSES—Celiac disease affects the small intestine. There are abnormalities in the intestinal lining, due\nto a permanent intolerance to gluten. Gluten is in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. (Corn, rice, millet,\nsoybeans, quinoa, and amaranth do not contain gluten. There seems to be a little uncertainty about\nbuckwheat.) The protein, gliaden, is thought to be the toxic part of the gluten. It interacts with the lining\nof the intestines, causing the tiny absorptive fingers which jut from it (the villi) to flatten and atrophy.\nAs a result, nutrients are not absorbed (including vitamins A, D, and K) and the disease symptoms\nappear.\nUnfortunately, many physicians and the food industries recommend that grains be introduced into the\ndiet of the infant when they are less than a year old. This can prompt celiac disease to first appear then\nor even decades later.\nThis is important! Tell every expectant mother not to feed her child grains until it is at least a year old.\nRemoving gluten from the diet of a celiac produces a marked change; whether an infant, child, or adult,\nthe person starts feeling better again. But he must not return to gluten foods.\nSome infants do not tolerate cow's milk protein, and react to it with celiac symptoms, even before gluten\nis given to them. So remove that also from them.\nCeliac disease is often misdiagnosed as spastic colon, irritable bowel syndrome, or something else which\naffects the intestines.\nYet, if left untreated, celiac disease can be quite serious. It can lead to pancreatic disease, infertility,\nmiscarriages, internal hemorrhaging, bone disease, gynecological disorders, nervous system damage,\nintestinal lymphoma, and many more. For example, anemia is common, due to poor absorption of folic\nacid, iron, and vitamins B and K.\n12\nScarring of the intestinal lining can progress so far that, by the age of 45 to 50, 90% of the intestine can\nbe damaged, resulting in a significant reduction (as much as 70%) of the absorptive surfaces.\nBut there is evidence that partial repair to those walls can be made within several months, if you\npermanently part company with the offending foods.",

This includes ice cream.\n• Beware of products which contain small amounts of added milk ingredients, such as\n\"milk solids.\" Lactose is added to many processed foods, including cookies, pancake\nmixes, breads, canned and powdered soups, flavored coffees, powdered drink mixes, and\nprocessed meats.\n• Since you cannot drink milk, eat foods which are rich in calcium. This includes broccoli,\ndried figs, apricots, blackstrap molasses, and other vegetable greens.\n• Do not eat spinach or rhubarb, for they contain a chemical which blocks absorption of\ncalcium.\n• Take supplemental calcium gluconate (or calcium lactate) powder. This is an excellent\nsource of nutritional calcium.\n• Many pharmaceutical drugs contain lactose as a filler.\n• Do not eat any solid food during a lactose attack of diarrhea. Just drink lots of good\nwater and replace lost minerals.\n• Acidophilus milk would not help the person with lactose intolerance, for the acidophilus\nworks to improve conditions in the colon, and the problems with lactose occur in the small\nintestine.\n—Also see \"Celiac Disease.\" Both have some similar symptoms and problems.\nSYMPTOMS—Diarrhea, gas, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms generally begin 30 minutes to 2 hours\nafter eating dairy products.\nIn infants, symptoms include foamy diarrhea with diaper rash, slow weight gain and development, as\nwell as vomiting.\nCAUSES—Lactose intolerance is inability to digest milk sugar. The intestinal wall is not able to make\nthe digestive enzyme, lactase, which is needed to split lactose into glucose and galactose. When the\nlactose is not split, it remains undigested in the intestinal tract; retains fluid; and ferments in the colon,\nproducing gas, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.\nAlthough it can cause digestive disruption and discomfort, lactose intolerance will not produce\ndangerous results, and can be easily controlled through careful diet.\nOddly enough, hardly any adults in the world can digest milk sugar after the age of 20. The exceptions\nare most Caucasians of northern European origin.\nThe following infections can result in lactose intolerance: irritable bowel syndrome, regional enteritis,\nand ulcerative colitis.\nAlthough less common, in infants and children it can occur after a severe attack of gastroenteritis, which\ninjures the intestinal wall.\nIf you are pregnant and there is lactose intolerance in your family, plan to breast-feed your child or give\nhim a non-dairy formula (such as soy milk). But, if you do, give him added calcium gluconate powder,\nsince soy milk does not contain enough calcium.\nLactose intolerance is different than milk allergy. A person with lactose intolerance cannot digest milk\nsugar; one with milk allergy can digest milk, but his immune system is antagonistic to one or more of its\ncomponents.",

The recommendations\nare simple enough:\n• Eat a nourishing diet, such as is outlined repeatedly in this book. For some people, it\nshould include more calories and protein than should normally be eaten. But for many\nwho are habitually underweight, the solution is to continue eating moderate-sized meals,\nbut eating only nourishing food (no junk or processed food). Adequate and complete\nproteins are essential.\n• Be sure and correct vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n• You may need to take digestive enzymes and/or supplemental hydrochloric acid (betaine\nHCl).\n• Obtain moderate out-of-door exercise each day. This will help your system digest the\nfood.\n• Obtain adequate rest at night, and try to lie down and rest 15, 30, or 60 minutes before\neach meal. This is important, and will strengthen your body for the challenge of coping\nsuccessfully with another meal.\n• Avoid stress of various kinds.\n• Eat in relaxed surroundings. Do not eat when you are nervous or upset.\n• Try to maintain regularity in all your habits and activities.\n• For infants, mashed bananas are more easily digested than some other foods.\n• There may be a food allergy, such as wheat, cow's milk, etc. (see Pulse Test).\n• It is vital that you not consume fried food, junk food, drink, and processed food. Avoid\ncaffeine, tobacco, and alcohol. If you are able to do so, do not take medicinal drugs.\n• Last but not least: If you are normally thin, but feel good, ignore the comments of others\nwho say you need to gain weight. Some of them wish they could be thinner.\n(Thinness)\nSYMPTOMS—The person weighs 10% less than an average person of his height and weight.\nSymptoms, when underweight, is a problem to be addressed. These symptoms include hunger, dizziness,\nfatigue, weakness, sensitivity to cold, and loss of ambition.\nCAUSES—Underweight is a problem for some, but not for others. Actually, as one ages, underweight\ncan be an advantage in a number of ways. If you are in good health, although underweight, there may be\nno need for concern to gain weight. Underweight people live longer and are in less danger from heart\ndisease.\nBut underweight may be associated with health problems; it should especially be a cause for concern if\nunintended, sudden weight loss has occurred.\nTry, if possible, to ascertain the cause of the weight loss or inability to gain weight. Here is a list of\nseveral possible causes:\nUnplanned-for weight loss can be caused by an inability by the gastro-intestinal tract to digest and\nabsorb food properly, resulting from ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, etc.\nIt can be caused by intestinal parasites or liver and pancreas problems.\nIt can be caused by digestive enzyme deficiency, allergy, or food sensitivity.\nIt can be caused by endocrine imbalances, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or (sometimes)\nhypothyroidism. If you are both underweight and feel cold all the time, you may be hypothyroid (which\nsee). Problems in the thyroid, pancreas, or adrenal glands can make weight gain impossible.\nHypoglycemics and diabetics have an especially hard time maintaining proper weight.\nIt can be caused by a chronic illness, surgery, stress, or emotional trauma (such as the death of a loved\none).\nIt can be caused by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, medicinal or street drugs, or AIDS.\nIn addition, there may be an eating disorder: The person eats too little (anorexia) or, in some cases, eats\ntoo much.\nZinc deficiency can reduce appetite, and so can some wasting diseases, such as cancer.\nThe consistency of the bowel movement and a check for undigested foods can be a valuable diagnostic\naid.\nThe experts tell us that, for adults, weight should not be gained at the rate of more than a pound a week.\nIn infants and children, the cause may be not enough food; in old people, it may result from disinterest in\neating or poverty.\nYou should especially be concerned about an infant or small child who suddenly seems to stop gaining\nweight normally.

Fluid can be retained in the belly cavity because the protein content of the\nblood is so low that fluid cannot be kept in the blood vessels.\n• If excess salt in the diet is the problem, then a very restricted salt diet should be adhered\nto. (Too much salt retained by the body requires additional water to keep the salt diluted,\nso it will not damage living tissue.)\n• Carry out a regular daily exercise program, out-of-doors.

But some have it when they are well. This article is for them. (See Common Cold and similar\narticles in that section.)\nNormally, these secretions, from the sinuses, flow down the back of the nose and throat and are swept\naway by cilia, which are small waving hairlike projections.\nBut sometimes the mucous dries out and the cilia no longer wiggle. Then the secretions pool in the back\nof the nose, thicken, and then begin dripping into the bronchial tubes or into the voice box.\nHere are several suggestions, one or more of which may solve the problem for you at such times:",

    "id": "disease-general-emphysema",
    "title": "Emphysema",
    "contentEn": "SYMPTOMS—It is only with great effort that the person can exhale air from his lungs. There is\ncontinual breathlessness. Most any exertion brings coughing. It is hard to breathe in, but worse to\nbreathe out. The neck veins often stand out from the effort, and he breathes through the mouth in order\nto try to get enough air in and out. Breathing is usually rapid and short. He may breathe 25-30 times a\nminute, and still not get enough air.\nEventually his chest becomes barrel-shaped, his face ruddy, and he speaks with short, broken phrases.\nCAUSES—The word, \"emphysema,\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"to puff up with air.\" The\nwalls of the lungs lose their elasticity, so air cannot be easily pushed in and out, as should normally\nhappen. So there is air in the lungs, but it is not moving in and out. As emphysema progresses and there\nis more obstruction to airflow, the lungs enlarge with trapped air.\nThe most frequent cause is smoking, but air pollution also receives some of the blame. Live in the\ncountry and do not have tobacco in your home, and you should be able to avoid this problem.\nEmphysema has become the most common modern lung infection in the Western world. Needing a\ncontinual exchange of air to survive, we use about a thousand cubic feet of air each day. It passes over\nlung surfaces which, if laid flat, would be as large as a tennis court. In emphysema, a large portion of the\nalveoli (the grape-like sacs where the air exchange occurs) are destroyed, and the blood is not properly\naerated.\nTREATMENT: LIVING WITH THE PROBLEM—\n• The person absolutely must stop smoking. Tobacco smoke should be banished from the\nhome, car, and place of work. Also avoid hair spray and other sprays.\n• Avoid allergens that you know of.\n• Maintain a program of regular exercise. Walking out-of-doors is always the best. Try\nusing 1- or 2-pound hand weights and work the muscles in the neck, upper shoulders, and\nchest. Those with chronic emphysema need strong muscles there more than others do.\n• Eat less and a little more often. Prolonged digestion requires more oxygen and blood to\nthe stomach, and away from other parts of the body which also need them.\n• Avoid gas-forming foods, such as legumes and cabbage. These cause abdominal\ndistention which can interfere with breathing.\n• Sip warm, clear liquids in the morning (such as herb teas), to help clear mucous from the\nairways.\n• Excessively hot or cold foods may induce coughing.\n• Avoid hard-to-chew foods and maintain a low- salt diet.\n• Do not eat when emotionally upset or angry.\n• Drink enough water. The fluid intake is needed to keep the mucous, in the lungs, thin.\n• Maintain your ideal body weight. Some of those with this problem tend to put on weight\nand retain fluid. The closer you are to your ideal weight, the better for your lungs. Stay on\na low-calorie diet. The thinner you are, the less flesh your lungs have to supply oxygen to.\n• Obesity and constipation decrease the patient's resistance to respiratory infection.\n• Keep your clothing loose; this helps you breathe better.\n• Learn to breathe correctly. The tendency is to breathe short and fast. But make yourself\nbreathe steadily, from the diaphragm. Strengthen your respiration muscles by blowing out\nslowly through pursed lips for 30 minutes a day. Try to exhale twice as long as it took you\nto breathe in.\n• Learn to cough properly. Inhale slowly and deeply, exhale through pursed lips, and\ncough in short huffing bursts rather than vigorously.\n• Pace yourself in your work. Work steadily; it is not necessary to work fast.\n• When working, lift while you exhale through pursed lips; inhale while you rest. When\nclimbing steps, climb while exhaling; inhale when you stop to rest.\n• Go through the day relaxed, not with a sense of alarm over your air problems.\n• Avoid contact with anyone with a respiratory infection.\n• Avoid drugs which suppress coughs. They dry up secretions, which you do not want.\n• Use only essential and unscented soaps. Avoid perfumes, gas stoves, carpeting, curtains\nand draperies which cannot easily be cleaned. Avoid hot, humid climates. Avoid furry,\nfeathered animals in your home.\n• Get plenty of fresh air. Use a warm scarf or mask over the mouth and nose when\noutdoors in cold weather. Keep the body warm at all times.\n• Place 3, 4, or 5-inch blocks under the foot of the bed. This will help prevent mucous\nfrom accumulating in the lower part of the lungs during the night. (But not too steep, for\nthat would be hard on the heart.)\nTREATMENT: SOLVING THE PROBLEM—\nThe suggestions above are typical of what you will find in most books. It is difficult to find remedial\nsolutions, but here is one:\nSeveral years ago, a Christian mother visited her neighbors, and met a woman with emphysema. It was a\nsmall, stuffy house and the lady smoked. So the mother went back home and eventually found a\ntreatment; it was a wet heating pack from Kneipp's book, written nearly two centuries ago. She gave the\ntreatment to the woman, who got well within several weeks. This was the treatment:\n• Place a plastic sheet on the bed, both above the bottom sheet and beneath the top sheet\nand covers. Dip another sheet in very cold water, and wring it out somewhat—quickly, to\nkeep in the cold.\n• Work quickly: Wrap the sheet about the person, who is standing unclothed. The sheet\ncovers everything but the head and perhaps part of the neck. Than wrap a dry blanket\naround him. The person immediately gets into the bed, and is covered well with the top\nsheet and blankets. This is essentially something like a heating pack, but done only with a\nwet sheet. The effect is immediate freezing cold, which the body gradually warms. The\nperson can remain like this all night.\nIn the years that followed, the mother mentioned the incident to a number of medical people and doctors,\nwho were astounded; for everyone says there is no cure for emphysema.",

Wheat bran, and other particulate,\nfibers are not as effective as those in fruits, vegetables, and legumes.\n• Eat foods rich in vitamin E. This includes nuts, seeds, and whole grains.\n• Only use cold-pressed vegetable oils (soy, corn, wheat germ, flaxseed). Never heat these\noils; place them on your food at the table.\n• Avoid refined sugar. It has been shown to increase serum cholesterol levels, leading to\natherosclerosis.\n• Do not eat animal protein; there is a definite connection between eating it and\ncardiovascular disease.\n• Do not eat processed, junk, dairy, white flour, spiced, or fried foods. Avoid pies, ice\ncream, salt, egg yolks, sugar, coffee, colas, nicotine, and alcohol.\n• Garlic eaten with cholesterol foods tends to reduce the likelihood that cholesterol will\nclog the arteries.\n• If you know you are moving toward artery problems, eat no free oils.\n• Eggplant tends to lower cholesterol levels.\n• Both peanut oil and coconut oil increase atherosclerosis.\n• Drink only distilled water.\n• Reduce stress and avoid situations causing it.\n• Get regular moderate exercise. Walking every day is the best. Build up slowly, but keep\nat it.\n• A strict vegetarian diet (without milk and eggs) is a good way to avoid artery problems.\n• Research at the University of Wisconsin disclosed that skim milk did not lower blood\ncholesterol.\n• Overweight people should reduce. Even 20% or more above ideal weight carries a\nsignificantly increased risk of atherosclerosis. What is your ideal weight? Assume 100\npounds for the first five feet; add to this five pounds for each inch over that, for women;\nadd seven pounds per inch over that, for men.\n• Do not smoke or use nicotine in any other form. Avoid second-hand smoke.\n• Do not take shark cartilage. It may inhibit production of new blood vessels needed to\nincrease blood circulation.\n• Eliminate all environmental sources of metal poisoning, such as aluminum or copper\ncooking utensils, copper or lead plumbing, lead-glazed ceramics, contaminated water, etc.\nToxic metals are known to be deposited, among other places, on artery walls.\n• X-rays make premature arteriosclerosis more likely.\n• Do not eat big evening meals. Best: Only eat plain fruit and plain bread for supper, and\ndo this several hours before bedtime.\n• Chromium (found in brewer's yeast, whole grains, and supplements) added to the diet\nlowers cholesterol.\n• Keep the extremities warm, to maintain good circulation in them.\n• Do not wear constrictive clothing (belts, garters, girdles, tight hosiery, etc.)\n• Glucose intolerance can produce a 100% increased risk of atherosclerosis. Keep your\nblood sugar levels normal. Do not binge on sweets, etc.\n• Avoid constipation, which weakens the liver and kidneys, which in turn sludges the\nblood. The Chinese treat stroke by treating constipation.\n• Drink enough water!\n• Periodically check your blood pressure.\n• Too much vitamin D can elevate blood cholesterol.\n—Also see \"Triglycerides, Lowering\"; \"Cholesterol, Reducing\"; Hypertension\"; \"Stroke\"; and \"Cardiac\nProblems.\"\n(Plaque Development and Hardening)\nSYMPTOMS—Early warning symptoms are intermittent claudication (which see). These are pains in\nthe legs and possibly feet, which leave upon resting. High blood pressure (see \"Hypertension\"). The later\nresult is angina (chest pains) and heart attack.\nCAUSES—These are two separate, major diseases, yet we list them together because the problems,\neffects, and solutions are so similar.\nArteriosclerosis is hardening of the walls of the arteries; atherosclerosis is the hardening of plaque on the\nwalls, which causes the walls to harden. (The full explanation is somewhat more complicated.)\nHardened walls produce higher blood pressure, but plaque-hardened and narrow vessels does it also.\nThe end result of both is a heart attack.\nThe main difference between the two is that arteriosclerosis is primarily the hardened walls themselves\n(which the plaque especially produced). Whereas atherosclerosis is the thickening of that plaque in the\narteries, so that the space for the blood to flow through keeps narrowing. In arteriosclerosis, these\ndeposits are primarily composed of calcium; in atherosclerosis, the deposits consist of fatty substances,\nprimarily cholesterol (a blood protein). But, much of the time, an odd assortment of both, along with\nlipoproteins, fatty acids, fibrous scar tissue, and blood clump together.\nBoth conditions have essentially the same effect on circulation, both cause hardening of the artery walls,\nboth cause high blood pressure, and both eventually lead to one or more of the same things: angina\n(which is chest pain following exertion), heart attack (the heart muscle can no longer bear the lack of\nblood supply to it), and stroke (when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off). Death may or may\nnot follow. The problem is that a clot of this plaque breaks loose, flows through the arteries, and gets\nstuck in a narrower artery. If this occurs in the heart muscle, angina and a heart attack may result; if in\nthe brain, a stroke occurs.\nTo complicate the matter further, not only can arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis cause high blood\npressure, but high blood pressure intensifies them both.\nCauses include elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels, eating high cholesterol foods (such as meat,\neggs, whole milk, or milk products).\nOther causes include smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, diabetes, emotional stress,\nlack of exercise, or a family history of the disease. Advancing age increases the risk factor.\nPain in the legs (usually in the calf, but sometimes in the feet or elsewhere in the legs), which increase\nwhen walking but stops as soon as one rests, is intermittent claudication (which see). There may also be\nweakness, numbness, and a heavy feeling in the legs. This is a symptom of atherosclerosis in the limbs\n(peripheral atherosclerosis). There can also, but less often, be pain in the arms.\nThere is a home test you can do to help determine if this is beginning to occur: Test the pulse in your\nlegs and foot. There are three places where this can be done: Apply light pressure on the top of the foot,\nthe inner hollow of the ankle, and in the hollow behind the knee. If you feel no pulse, then the artery\nmay be narrowing.\nAtherosclerosis is the most common form of arterial disease in the U.S. and most frequently occurs in\nthe lower limbs. It is the primary cause of death over the age of 65. Over 50% of the people between 65\nand 70 will die of some form of this.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\nFind out what your ongoing problems are and solve them. Problems are like a wall; you can go through\nthem, go over them, or go around them. You go through a problem when you eliminate it. You surmount\nan immediate problem when you figure out a way to sidestep it and still do what is needed. You go\naround it when you learn to live with an ongoing situation you cannot solve. You stop worrying about it\nor letting it bother you, and turn your attention to other things.\nHere are several basic suggestions:\n• Think positive in every situation. See a good side to it, and learn to make the best of it.\nSee it as an interesting challenge to solve difficulties. Trust in God to help you weather\nevery crisis and carry on through to the end.\nThink about something else for a time. That will help your brain to rest and your emotions\nto calm down. Gradually answers will come to mind.\n• Counsel with a good friend. If it is a problem with your husband, counsel with a woman,\nnot with a man. The same holds true for a man.\n• The primary problems in a person's life are employment, spouse, money, children,\ndeadlines, and guilt.\n• Sometimes you need to temporarily leave a threatening situation and get away and calm\ndown, take time to pray and rest your mind.\n• Stretching your muscles can help move a circulation made sluggish by the situation, so\nyou can think better. Massage muscles which have tensed up. Drop your jaw and move it\nleft to right. This helps relax the jaw muscle.\n• Take a hot bath; that really relaxes you, so you can start thinking constructively again.\n• Go outside and walk in the open air. Hold your head up, breath deeply, and relax.\n• Many times, the underlying need is to go to God and ask forgiveness, obey His Ten\nCommandment law, and start living a new, clean life. Make things right with those you\nhave wronged.\n• Believe that, with God's help, the situation can be dealt with. Keep trusting Him as a\nlittle child trusts his parent to lead him by the hand across a busy street.\n• A change in diet is needed to help restore a sickly immune system. Fresh fruit and\nvegetables, especially raw vegetables. Kelp or dulse, and raw seeds or nuts. Be sure and\ntake enough vitamin C, as well as a full range of supplementary vitamins and minerals.\n• The following herbs are helpful: ginkgo, echinacea, dong quai, gotu kola, bilberry, milk\nthistle, catnip, chamomile, hops, skullcap, and valerian. Take them separately or mix 2-3\ntogether, and take as a tea.\n(Nervousness)\nSYMPTOMS—Depression, anxiety, irritability, chronic fatigue, low-stress tolerance, nervous\nexhaustion, unable to cope, insomnia, panic attacks, unable to relax, or diseases caused by immune\nproblems.\nTightening of stomach muscles which causes nausea or digestive problems. Increases in blood pressure,\nsweaty palms, nervous twitches, tooth grinding, trembling when not cold. Tense muscles, especially\nshoulder muscles.\nPoor concentration, cannot retain information, negative thoughts, loss of sense of humor, demanding\nattitude, critical attitude, or becoming withdrawn.\nCAUSES—Here are a few of the many causes: deadlines, pressures, problems at home or work, special\noccasions, crowds, noise, pain, traffic, temperature extremes, overwork, lack of sleep, smoking, alcohol,\na worrywart attitude.\nResearchers estimate that stress is significant in 80% of all major illnesses, including cancer, back\nproblems, endocrine, cardiovascular, skin, and infectious diseases.\nThe adrenals especially suffer from stress. This results in a lowering of the immune system's ability to\nprotect you from infection and cancer. It also disrupts the function of your entire endocrine system.\nEveryone experiences stress from time to time, but frequent stress is more serious. And long-term stress\nwears out the body.\nSome people can handle stress better than others. Some individuals work in the emergency room at the\nhospital and thoroughly enjoy the excitement and challenge of every new crisis which comes along.\nOthers burn out and have to transfer out within a year.",

This can be a heating pad or a hot shower.\nHere are several longer-range solutions:\n• Do neck exercises each day, to stretch your neck muscles and strengthen them.\n• To stretch those muscles, slowly tilt your head forward and back and turn from side to\nside.\n• To strengthen them, put your hand on the side of your head and push. Then do the other\nside, and then the back and front. Hold light weights (3-5 pounds) in your hands, keeping\nyour arms straight while shrugging your shoulders.\n• Sit in chairs which give you good back support.\n• Sit up, not forward. Keep your head level and pull in your chin. Arrange your work so\nyou can look forward, and not downward, most of the time.\n• Stop every so often and take a break.\n• Always lift heavy things carefully with the legs and not the back.\n• Sleep on a firm mattress.\n• Do not sleep on your stomach, but, better, on your side or on your back.\n• Keep your neck warm when you are outside in the cold.\n• You may do better with a smaller pillow or no pillow at all.\nSYMPTOMS—A pain in the neck.\nCAUSES—Working in a hunched-over position for long hours is a frequent cause.

When this happens, the chilled part does not receive adequate rest. A\nnerve in the face or neck can become chilled and cause problems.\n• Apply warm, wet washcloths twice a day, for 20 minutes at a time, to relieve pain and\ntenseness. Follow with gentle massage both backward and upward.\n• Apply pure water to the affected eye 4 times a day, to keep it moist and free from dust.\nWearing sunglasses will reduce evaporation from that eye. Occasionally close that eye\nwith the finger, to rest it. Wear an eye patch at night to protect it.\n• A few days later, as the muscles begin functioning again, he should exercise his facial\nmuscles: Standing before a mirror, wrinkle the forehead, close the affected eye, purse the\nlips, move the mouth to one side and then the other, blow out the cheeks, and try to\nwhistle.\n• Until the problem clears up, place charcoal poultices over the weakened nerve area at\nnight, and maintain a low-salt diet. This will help eliminate fluid released by the nerve.\n• Prednisone is a drug often given, but it has negative side effects.\n—Bell's palsy is a form of neuralgia; see \"Neuralgia\" for additional helpful information.\n(Facial Palsy)\nSYMPTOMS—Pain in the temples and/or neck. Only one side is generally affected. There is pain,\nweakness, and a sensation of pricking, tingling, or creeping on the skin. One side of the face can droop.\nCAUSES—Bell's palsy is a type of paralysis characterized by distortion of the face, due to a lesion of\nthe facial nerve.\nIt may be caused by injury, irritation of a sensory nerve, or nerve root. A decayed tooth may be the\ncause. Chilling of the face at night while one is sleeping can also produce it; the blood has been chilled\nback from the area. Sometimes Bell's palsy follows a respiratory infection.\nBell's palsy is often mistaken for a stroke, because it comes on suddenly and results in numbness and\npartial, or total, loss of muscular control on the affected side. But it is not a stroke.\nTreated properly, there can be as much as 80% chance of significant recovery—all those with partial\npalsy and three fourths of those with complete palsy recover with no treatment of any kind. Because\nmost of those with this problem recover spontaneously, they should not be given drugs or surgery.\nBut severe taste impairment and/or reduced tearing of the eyes are bad signs, especially in older people.\nBell's palsy can occur in anyone at any age, but most frequently occurs between 20 and 40, often in the\nsummer months (especially August). The younger the person is the more likely he will have a full\nrecovery.",

A slight redness and swelling of the affected side will be\nseen, along with an increased flow of saliva and tears.\nThe affected nerves and skin become very tender; and movements of the face, speaking, and chewing\nmay provoke violent pain.\nCAUSES—Tic douloureux is a common form of neuralgia. It generally occurs in winter.\nThere are three divisions of the sensory nerve of the face most likely to be affected. The first is in the\neyeball and over the forehead; the second is in the side of the face, the cheekbone, and the upper teeth;\nthe third is inside the mouth and in the lower teeth.\nThe cause of the problem is chilling of the face over a period of time, when the rest of the body is\nrelatively warm.

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Search out the cause and try to correct it.\n• Rest the painful limb in as comfortable a position as possible.\n• Apply hot, wet applications to the affected leg, for the relief of pain and inflammation.\n• Give prolonged applications of dry heat in any form (hot water bottles, radiant heat, or\nelectric heating pads).\n• Apply heat in the form of hot fomentations, 3 times a day, omitting any use of ice or cold\nwater.\n• After each application of heat, rub the limb to increase circulation.\n• Carefully apply stretching exercises, but always stop before there is pain it becomes too\nuncomfortable. Do each exercise 3 times, 2-3 times a day, increasing the number as\nimprovement occurs:\n• Pull the knees up as close to the chin as possible. You will feel a pulling sensation in the\nlower back.\n• Sitting in a chair, reach under it as far as possible, and bend from the hip only.\n• While laying on the back, the leg is raised with the knee straight. Someone else raises the\nleg, bending it from the hip only. This stretches the sciatic nerve and the hamstring\nmuscles.\n• If the attack of pain lasts so long that the leg muscles have lost considerable strength,\nmassage and a daily hot and cold leg bath (cold after the painful period is over) will help\nto restore circulation and strength.\n• There are times when a back adjustment helps. If the back is out of adjustment, this pain\ncan occur. You will want to weigh this possibility carefully.\n• Fast one day a week, and eat only raw food for a month.\n• Have a good foot massage every 3 days and especially around the Achilles tendons, up\nthe back of the ankles.\n• Add 2 cups of salt to a boiling quart of water. When quite warm, apply with a cloth to\nthe area until relief comes.\n• Get fresh air, sunlight, and, if possible, moderate exercise.\nAlso apply the preventative measures, below.\n• If no improvement results from home treatments, you may wish to consult a specialist.\nHe is likely to tell you that an operation is necessary. Should you have an operation on\nyour spine? Carefully read the article, \"Backache,\" for additional information on the entire\nsubject.\nPreventative measures: If you identify the problem early on, there may be greater likelihood of\ncontaining or eliminating it.\n• Taking vitamin B complex is very important for healthy nerves. Taking supplemental\ncalcium, magnesium, silica, and vitamin D for the bones is also important. Read the article\non \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\n• Be careful of your back when you work!\n—Read \"Bones, Strengthening\" for much information. Also read \"Backache\" for detailed information on\nback trouble. Also read \"Neuralgia,\" since sciatica is a form of it.\nSYMPTOMS—Pain is noted down the back of the thigh, the outer side of the calf and along the outer\nside of the foot, or on the top of the foot to the big toe. The person compensates by placing more weight\non the other leg and foot. The pain is often worse at night and coughing, walking, heavy labor, or\nsneezing increases both the pain in the back and in the sciatic nerve.\nStill later, numbness may be felt when the hand is rubbed over the area where the pain is felt.\nLater still, a wasting of the muscles of the calf and a weakness in running and even walking may be\nnoticed.\nCAUSES—The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve comes out of the spine and a\nbranch runs down each leg, along the back of the thigh, down the inside of the leg, to the ankle.\nThere are two primary causes of sciatica:\nThe first is chilling the thigh over a lengthy period of time. The experts tell us that sciatica usually\nbegins as a neuralgia of the sciatic nerve. If you sit on cold surfaces a lot (steel folding chairs in cool\nrooms, or steel tree chairs while hunting, or steel boat seats while fishing, etc.) for lengthy periods of\ntime, you can irritate the sciatic nerve and produce sciatica.\nFortunately, this form of sciatica is quite easy to solve: Apply neuralgia-type treatments, and only sit on\nwarm surfaces or surfaces your body can heat relatively easily. Do not overlook chairs with foam that\nare too deep to easily warm up within a short time (say, 8 inches).\nOn your favorite chairs, place a folded, wool blanket or a piled thinner blanket. That is something you\ncan warm up. Experiment, and see what works best for you. If your body does not begin warming it up\nin a few minutes, lay something down that will.\nUnfortunately, there is a second, and much more serious, cause:\nThe second cause of sciatica is damage to the lower spine. There may be a history of an accident, a fall,\nthe lifting of a heavy weight, or a twist under some tension. Pain was first felt in the lower back. Later\n(weeks or even years later) pain begins to be felt at one or more places along the entire course of the\nsciatic nerve—back of the thigh, outer side of the calf, or in the top of the foot to the big toe.\nOne of the cartilaginous plates (disks, also spelled discs) in the lumbar region of the lower back has been\ndamaged. The cartilage bulges and later breaks, creating pressure backward against a nerve root. (It is\nalso possible for a tumor to develop and press against the sciatic nerve, but this is far less likely.)\nOther important facts are these: (1) The person probably was not maintaining a nourishing diet, with\nsupplemental calcium, and other bone-building factors. (2) He may have been overworking his body in\nrunning, weight-lifting, etc. (3) He was not lifting objects properly. (4) He was working at an\noccupation, such as lifting heavy patients in a nursing home, which is hazardous.\nIn older people who do not obtain enough bone-building materials in their diet, degenerative problems\ncan occur in newly formed spicules, or ridges, of bone. These may press on a nerve root.\nSome people derange their lower back by the simple method of always carrying a thick wallet in one\npants back pocket.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Back adjustments by a competent chiropractor may be the solution.\n• Keep the hands and arms warm at night, especially if there is a cool draft on the body.\n• Improve the diet. A good, nourishing diet which will build the nerves and bones is\nimportant. Raw green vegetables are needed, along with daily vitamin/mineral\nsupplements. A diet similar to that used in treating arthritis (which see) is helpful.\n• Maintain an ongoing exercise program, to strengthen the muscles of the shoulders and\narms and improve the posture: arm lifts, neck exercises, shoulder shrugs, horizontal upper\ntrunk push-ups, etc. Also helpful: swimming, ball throwing, and similar activities.\n• Avoid heavy lifting. When you have to lift, shrug first, and remain in a semi-shrugged\nposition while you lift. This will ward off nerve compression.\n(Thoracic Outlet Syndrome)\nSYMPTOMS—One to three hours after falling asleep, there is a sense of pins, needles, numbness, and\npain in one or both hands. The discomfort generally wakes the person. There may be wasting in the\nsmall muscles in the hands, as well as coldness or swelling. It generally occurs among adults, not\nchildren.\nThe symptoms can eventually include the lower arm, upper arm, and even the shoulder, and are\ngenerally worse after a day of heavy lifting.\nDuring the day few symptoms are present, unless heavy lifting occurs.\nCAUSES—This is to the shoulder, what sciatica is to the leg. A nerve, leading to the shoulder, is\npinched in the spine.\nBut it can also be caused by overworking of the arms, carrying excessively heavy weights, poor posture,\nand letting the arms and hands get cold at night. More rarely, there may be an abnormality in the seventh\ncervical rib.\nThe lower branch of the brachial plexus of nerves exits from the lower cervical vertebrae, then passes\nunderneath the clavicle and on into the arm. If this somehow experiences compression, the nerves to the\narm and hand will be affected.\nIt is best to solve this problem, since it is likely otherwise to gradually keep getting worse.\nA similar affliction is called the cervical rib syndrome. But it occurs more often in younger people, and\nproduces pain or numbness soon after heavy lifting, wearing a heavy coat, etc. The symptoms occur in\nthe day, not at night.",

Avoid especially Cold Full Baths and very prolonged Hot Baths.\n—Also see \"Neuritis—1.\"\n# NERVES, STRENGTHENING\nBUILDING UP THE NERVES—Good blood, healthy nerves, and strong bones and joints are needed\nfor good health. Here are several suggestions, to help you strengthen your nerves. This is a building\nprogram:\nThe vitamin B complex (100 mg per day; best taken as 50 mg twice a day) is especially important in\nmaintaining good nerve action and response. Deficiencies of the B complex are common among people\neating modern, devitalized, processed, and assorted junk foods. Take a good vitamin/mineral supplement\nat least twice a day. It should include all the B vitamins.\nVitamin B , also called thiamine (100 mg, twice a day) is especially needed for neuritis.\n1\nVitamin B (niacin, 50 mg twice a day). Do not take more than 100 mg of niacin a day. Niacinamide is\n3\nequivalent to niacin, and does not produce the flushed face which niacin does.\nVitamin B (2,000 mcg, twice a day).\n12\nVitamin B (250-500 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for carpal tunnel syndrome.\n6\nFolic acid (400-800 mcg, daily).\nInositol (1000 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for diabetic neuropathy.\nIn addition to the above B vitamins, also take Vitamin C with bioflavonoids (3,000-6,000 mg daily,\nwhen you have a nerve crisis).\nVitamin E (400 IU, 2-3 times a day), especially with post-herpes syndrome.\nVitamin A (5,000 IU, a day), but not over 10,000 IU a day if you are pregnant. It is best to take vitamin\nA supplementation in the form of beta-carotene.\nMinerals include calcium (400 mg, 2-3 times daily), magnesium (200 mg, 2-3 times a day), zinc (50-80\nmg daily, not to exceed 100 mg daily from all supplements), and iodine.\nEssential fatty acids, obtained from 1-2 tbsp. of cold pressed oils daily. Never put it into your cooking;\ninstead, put it on your food after the plate is served.\nFresh and steamed vegetables are rich in minerals which are needed for the nervous system and brain.\nBrewer's yeast, kelp or dulse, lecithin, and wheat germ oil are very helpful. Eat regularly, chew slowly,\nand do not overeat.\nOctocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.\nIncrease your fluid intake.\nObtain enough rest at night and avoid sexual enervation. Medical professionals know that such\nenervation is one of the quickest ways to produce weakened, degenerate, and diseased nerve tissue.\nA good balance between exercise and rest has a powerful effect in building the body, if a nutritious diet\nis maintained.\nAvoid stimulants and all processed, refined, and junk foods.\nCool and cold water treatments will help tone and strengthen the nerves.\nThe nervine herbs include skullcap, hop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, passion flower,\nlady's slipper, mistletoe, and small amounts of lobelia.\nReviewing some of the nutrients needed, as they apply to the brain, we learn this:\nThere is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is clogged, mental\nillness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in others.\nEliminate the \"glue foods\"; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous and toxins in it,\nand lead to mental problems. Such foods include White flour, sugar, eggs, meat, peanuts, and dairy\nproducts.\nA high carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the brain, and produces\na calming, peaceful feeling.\nBrain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients.\nDeficiencies of the B complex and vitamin C decrease the metabolic rate of the brain. Lack of niacin can\nproduce deep depression, often seen in psychosis. Symptoms of a severe vitamin B deficiency are\n6\nheadache, irritability, dizziness, extreme nervousness, and inability to concentrate. Pantothenic acid\n(another B vitamin) is needed to handle stressful situations. A thiamine deficiency results in a lack of\nenergy, constant fatigue, loss of appetite, and irritability; if this continues too long, there are emotional\nupsets and overreaction to normal stress. Lack of vitamin C leads to irritability.\nAdequate calcium in the diet is vital. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for ways to maintain enough calcium\nin the body. Inadequate calcium results in insomnia, tenseness, and fatigue.\nCalcium and magnesium protect the nerves from damage.\nToo much copper in the body occurs in schizophrenia, and can be reduced by dietary intake of zinc and\nmanganese. Vitamin C deficiency can cause copper retention which accumulates in the brain and liver.\nVitamin B complex (especially B , B , B and folic acid) reduces excess estrogen from the liver and\n3 6 12,\nprevents it from causing mental troubles.\nMany of the schizophrenias, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning disorders are caused\nby too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes. Plastic water pipes are the safest.\nA person with a magnesium deficiency tends to be uncooperative, withdraw, apathetic, or belligerent.\nIt is vital to obtain enough oxygen, if you want a clear mind which functions properly. Vitamin E helps\nthe brain obtain enough oxygen from the amount supplied to the lungs.\nA lack of thyroxine, the hormone from the thyroid, results in a slowing of physical and mental functions.\nHyperthyroidism is related to emotional disturbance, forgetfulness, slow thought processes, and\nirritability.\nWhen the adrenals do not function properly, depression and other forms of mental illness may result.\nExercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps rejuvenate the body\nand mind.\nGinkgo biloba improves brain function and cerebral circulation, and enhances memory.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• For 3-4 days, do not do the types of activities which cause the pain.\n• Apply cold or hot to the affected area, according to which helps you best: Apply ice on\nthe affected area for 30-90 minutes each day; the more the pain, the longer the application.\nOr apply heat, especially after the first few day.\n• Careful exercise is also needed, to eliminate tennis elbow; rest is not enough. The\ntendons need to be strengthened. Purchase a hand gripper at a sporting goods store, and\nslowly increase your usage of it until you are using it 5-10 minutes, 4 times a day. When\nyou use it, the elbow should be straight and the wrist bent. This will stretch the extensor\ntendons and help strengthen the fibrous tendons.\n• Other exercises are also helpful. Place your forearm on a table, palm down, and grip a 3-\npound dumbbell. Flex the wrist upward slightly; hold for 5 seconds, lower and rest for 3\nseconds. When you can easily do this 15 times, increase the weight by 1 pound. Over a\nperiod of 4-6 weeks of doing this every day, you may be able to move up to 8-10 pounds\nlifted without pain. Medical Tribune (January 12, 1977) reported that 14 of 18 patients, on\na four-week program with this exercise, obtained complete pain relief.\n• Athletes sometimes place a band several inches wide around the forearm near the elbow,\nand another just above the wrist. Be sure they are not too tight.\n• Avoid cortisone injections, for these can produce tendon atrophy or even dissolve it!\n—Also see \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Tenderness and pain in the elbow, weakness in the hand.\nCAUSES—Tennis elbow is an occupational and recreational problem. Those who do a lot of hand-\ngripping can have this disorder.

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• As soon as the tingling begins, begin doing some gentle hand exercises. Rotate the wrist\nin a circle for 2 minutes. This exercises all the muscles of the wrist, restores circulation,\nand gets your wrist out of the position that usually causes the trouble.\n• Raise your hands above your head and rotate your arms while rotating your wrists at the\nsame time. Also do some neck turns; look over your right, then left, shoulder. Learn to\nexercise and relax as you work.\n• Vitamin B helps eliminate the problem.\n6\n• Eat half a fresh pineapple daily, for 1-3 weeks. The bromelain in it will reduce swelling\nand pain.\n• Eat only moderate amounts of oxalic acid foods (beets, beet greens, sorrel, Swiss chard,\ncabbage family, eggs, parsley, asparagus.). Avoid spinach, and especially rhubarb. Fish\nhave oxalic acid also.\n• Avoid salt and all sodium foods, for they promote water retention.\n• Try to reduce the impact of repetitive mechanical tasks on your wrists and hands. If\npossible, stop all such movements for several days and see if improvement occurs. If so,\ntry to do these functions less frequently. If possible, rotate your duties, so you do not do\nthose repetitive tasks every day.\n• Keep your weight down. Extra weight puts more pressure on the carpal tunnel.\n• Keep your arms close to your body and your wrists straight while sleeping. For example,\nif you let your hand drop over the side of the bed while you are sleeping, the pressure on\nthe median nerve is increased.\n• You might wish to temporarily wear a wrist splint at night. This helps keep the wrist\nstraight.\n• Do not wrap your wrist in an Ace bandage. This could cut off the circulation.\n• If you have to carry something, make the sure the handle is the right size. If it is too\nsmall or large, it could hurt your wrist.\n• Aloe vera, yarrow, and yucca help restore flexibility and reduce inflammation. Skullcap\nrelieves muscle spasms and pain. Wintergreen oil reduces pain and aids circulation to the\nmuscles.\nPREVENTION—Carpal tunnel syndrome is a problem which many can develop in our time. Here are\nseveral suggestions for avoiding its occurrence:\n• Use a tool instead of flexing your wrists forcibly.\n• Use your whole hand and all your fingers when you grip an object.\n• In doing a task, use your whole arm, not just your wrist. For example, when hammering,\nswing your arm rather than just your wrist.\n• Maintain good posture and keep your elbows bent when typing, writing, etc. What is the\nideal position? Cock your wrist back slightly, so that your thumb is parallel to your\nforearm. Your hand should be in approximately the same position as if it were holding a\npen. This position keeps the carpal tunnel as open as possible. Place a wrist pad on the\ntable, just in front of the keyboard.\n• Before starting handwork, exercise the fingers and wrists for a couple minutes, to warm\nthem up. Take a break from handwork every hour. Shake out your hands every so often\nthroughout the day.\n—Also see \"Tennis Elbow.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Mild numbness and faint tingling to excruciating pain, but generally only burning,\ntingling, or numbness in the thumb and first three fingers. Crippling atrophy of the thumb can result.\nSymptoms are often worse at night or in the morning. The pain may eventually spread to the arm and\nshoulder. Symptoms normally affect only one hand, but may be present in both.\nCAUSES—Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a cumulative trauma disorder that develops over time, due\nto repeated stressful movements of the hands and wrist. It affects 23,000 workers a year. The median\nnerve in the wrist is compressed or damaged. This nerve controls the thumb muscles and sensation in the\nthumb, palm, and first three fingers. The median nerve passes through a very small opening, about a\nquarter inch below the top of the wrist.\nEither compression or injury to this nerve can cause problems: Pressure from the bone spurs\ninflammatory arthritis or tendonitis, swelling due to pregnancy or water retention.\nOther causes include repeated stressful motions, such as writing, typing, or hammering. Bookkeepers\nand checkout clerks can develop it; so can hairstylists, musicians, writers, drivers, athletes, restaurant\nservers, and jack hammer and chain-saw operators. The occurrence of CTS has greatly increased since\nthe 1980s, when personal computers came into use. The tendons swell and compress the median nerve\nthat runs to your hand, causing great pain. A common pattern is rapid and continuous use of the fingers,\nproducing a repetitive wrist motion injury. Women between 29 and 62 experience CTS more often than\nanyone else.\nRaynaud's disease, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and menopause increase the risk of developing\nCTS.\nOther disorders, especially arthritis in the neck, have similar symptoms. But, if the first three fingers in\none or both hands are affected by the pain, then it is probably CTS.",

Place a soft pad between his teeth, to avoid biting his tongue or\ncheeks.\n• If an infant, put him in a bath of 95o F. or in mustard and water bath at 85o F. Cold\nshould be applied to the head. The cause must first be found, or injury may result from the\nbath. If fever is present, it should be a tepid or cool bath.\n• Produce vomiting by placing the finger down the throat. If gums are hot and swollen,\ngive cold water and rub gums with a cloth that has been held on ice.\n• The bowels should be emptied immediately with an enema. Take some laxative herbs, to\nclean out the small intestine. Fast on fruit juices, water, or nervine herb teas (listed below)\nuntil all symptoms subside. Keep the body warm.\n• After this, rest in bed, absolutely quiet; give careful diagnosis without disturbing him.\n• One successful method of therapy has been the injection in 1 large dose of 600,000 IU of\nvitamin D. This helps the utilization of calcium.\n• Take calcium (2,000 mg, daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg, daily) supplements. Also B\n6\n(100 mg, twice a day) and chromium (75-100 mcg, 3 times a day).\n• Helpful herbs include catnip, skullcap, and peony. Two cups of valerian root may be\ntaken every 2 hours after the convulsions. Antispasmodic tincture (which see) is best and\nworks faster.\n• Other useful herbs include rue, black cohosh, valerian, vervain, peppermint, chamomile,\nwild cherry bark, goldenseal, and a little cayenne.\n• One Central American naturopath says that, over the years, he has treated a thousand\ncases of convulsions—and fully one-half were caused by parasites. Other important\ncauses are constipation and wrong diet. He puts them on a cleansing and building\nprogram, discarding all meat eating, and requiring that they never return to it (so they will\nnot again become infested with worms).\n• If parasites are the cause, use garlic enemas, plus eat garlic (see \"Worms\" for more\ninformation).\n• There is a definite possibility, especially in children, that a food allergy is involved, very\npossibly accompanied by malnutrition (maybe partially caused by being fed too much\njunk food and soft drinks). After the convulsion is past, begin testing with pulse tests for\nfood allergies (see \"Pulse Test\").\n• If it should be a spasm of asthma, take 8 drops of antispasmodic tincture (which see) or\ninhale eucalyptus oil.\n• If it is a muscle spasm, wring a towel out of hot water and lay it on the area.\n• A coughing spasm can be relieved by the tincture or an emetic.\n—Also see \"Antispasmodic Tincture\" and \"Epilepsy.\"\n(Spasms, Seizures, Fits)\nSYMPTOMS—Paroxysms of involuntary muscular contractions and relaxations, which occur most\nfrequently in children.\nCAUSES—Convulsions are uncontrolled body movements set off by an electrical malfunction of the\nbrain.\nConvulsions can be caused by epilepsy, meningitis, tetanus, uremia, hysteria, or eclampsia. They can\nalso be induced by poisoning from camphor, cyanide, strychnine, santonin, brucine, or aspidium.\nIn children the cause is often wrong diet, rickets, syphilis, malaria, toxemias, or acute infectious\ndiseases.\nIn adults, the cause is often epilepsy, heat cramps, strychnine, or food poisoning.\nConvulsions, due to tetanus and hydrophobia, are easily distinguished and, for the most part, involve a\nsmall portion of the voluntary muscles. Strychnine poisoning causes spasms which involve the whole\nbody.\nHigh fevers of 104o-105o F. are often a cause of convulsions in children.",

Changes in temperament and extreme sleepiness indicate dangerous changes in\ncerebrospinal fluid.\nWarning: A child can be hurt when he is picked up.\nCAUSES—Meningitis is an inflammation of the two membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.\nThey are called the meninges. In addition, the thin membranes that cover the spinal cord may also be\ninfected. It is a contagious disease.\nCauses include several different viruses (including those causing polio, measles, rubella, fungi, yeast\ninfection) and several types of bacteria.\nInfection can spread from the nose and throat to the meninges. A depleted immune system (along with\nnose and throat trouble) can cause it to enter the blood stream and go to the brain.\nIf not treated properly, a case of flu or ear, nose, and throat infections can develop into meningitis.\nEating heavy meals or taking drugs while sick can cause an infection to drive deeper into the system and\nenter the brain area.\nOther factors aiding in the development of meningitis are alcoholism, brain surgery, brain cancer,\nexposure to chemical agents, head injury, pneumonia, Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, or anything\nthat weakens the immune system (chemotherapy, radiation treatment, steroid therapy, HIV infection,\nand certain types of cancer).\nOf the three main types of meningitis, viral infection is more common and produces milder symptoms,\nsuch as malaise and headache, which generally clears up on its own in a week or two.\nBut the bacterial type requires prompt, aggressive treatment—or brain damage or death can result. (Any\ntime a bacterial infection occurs [such as strep throat or an ear infection], eliminate it; do not ignore the\nproblem.)\nFungal meningitis progresses more slowly, but also requires medical care.\nDo not guess!

Difficulty in\nbreathing, swallowing, and speaking.\nThe onset is gradual, and the symptoms are worse in the evening.

The name means \"muscle weakness.\"\nAdolescents and young adults, especially women, are the most likely to have this problem. But it\nsometimes occurs in newborn infants and adults over 40. In the latter case, a tumor in the thymus is\ninvolved. It rarely occurs past 50.\nThe muscles of the face and neck are primarily involved, but those in the trunk and extremities may also\nbe involved.\nSome cases are mild; others are rapidly fatal. When the respiratory system is involved, death is much\nmore likely to result from this disease. Progress of the disorder is variable, and prolonged remission may\noccur.\nIt is thought to be an autoimmune disease that causes malfunctioning of the enzyme, acetylcholine,\nwhich is responsible for inducing muscles to contract. (It is conjectured that there may also be an excess\nof cholinesterase at the myoneural junction in which the nerve impulses fail to induce normal muscle\ncontractions, but this is less likely.)\nThere is a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. Either the\nacetylcholine release is not adequate or the muscle response to the acetylcholine is not sufficient. An\nautoimmune factor may be involved (i.e., there are so many toxins in the body, that the system interferes\nwith normal functions.)\nAutointoxication may thus be a primary cause. Toxins accumulate in the bloodstream from chemicals,\nchronic constipation, etc. Either they destroy the muscular system or they trigger other body systems to\ndo so.\nChronic constipation can cause the cecum to press against the ileocecal valve, releasing poisons of the\ncolon back into the small intestine. This is a dangerous situation, since toxins in the small intestine are\nabsorbed into the blood far more quickly than when they are in the colon.",

The person's own determination and\nfaithfulness in an exercise program will forestall the progress of the disease better than\nalmost anything else. Every exercise keeps the muscles more useful. Use a wide variety of\nsimple exercises! Buy a book on weight lifting; but, of course, use much smaller weights.\nSwing the arms forcefully when walking. Exercises involving joint movements (including\nthe neck) are very important.\n• Keep the feet a distance apart, when walking, and take short steps, when turning.\n• Typing, writing, working with clay, etc., helps the fingers.\n• Breathe deeply in and out.\n• Take frequent rest periods.\n• Read aloud, to keep the mouth muscles in good condition.\n• Any act difficult to perform should be done daily.\n• A nutritious diet, adequate rest, exercise in the open air, enough fluids, and sunlight help\nslow the effects of Parkinson's disease.\n• Octocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.\n• Eat foods and take supplements containing antioxidants. The most important of these is\nvitamin E (3,200 IU daily!) and vitamin C (3,000 mg daily!). This can slow the\nprogression of Parkinson's disease by 2-3 years! Theoretically, a person who takes\nsignificant dosage levels will never contract Parkinson's disease in the first place. It\nappears that free-radical damage may be a major cause of damage of dopamine-producing\nbrain cells.\n• Iron supplementation seems to help in some cases. The production of tyrosine, an\nenzyme involved in dopa production (the precursor of dopamine), is stimulated by iron\nsupplementation in the diet.\n• Here are some additional helps and dosages of worthwhile natural substances:\noctocosanol (300 mcg, three times a day), Neuro-Gen leucine (10 gm/day), l-methionine\n(5 gm/day), essential fatty acids (1tbsp., twice a day), ltyrosine (100 mg/day), dl-\nphenoalanine (100 mg, three times a day), B (200 mg, three times a day), B (100 mg,\n1 6\nthree times a day), betaine HCl (75-200 mg three times a day before meals).\n• Overweight is a problem; take the extra weight off.\n• Ingestion of aluminum is a factor in Alzheimer's disease, and it may also be involved in\nParkinson's disease. Do not use aluminum cookware or use deodorants containing it (alum\nis aluminum). Also avoid lead. Some people with Parkinson's disease have high levels of\nlead in their brains.\n• L-dopa (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine), in form of the drug brand, Levodopa, is a synthetic\ndopamine which is given to patients, to supply the missing dopamine. Intriguingly\nenough, actual dopamine (from animal sources) cannot be given, because there is a blood-\nbrain barrier rejecting it. So levodopa is given, which is accepted (through conversion to\ndopamine in the basal ganglion).\n• But two facts should be noted: (1) Vitamin B reverses the effects of levodopa, so efforts\n6\nmust be made to eliminate B from the diet. (Eat in moderation bananas, oatmeal, peanuts,\n6\nwhole grains, potatoes, meat, and fish and only eat protein foods in the evening.) (2)\nLevodopa usually produces side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, insomnia, mental\nconfusion, and agitation, as well as liver and kidney damage.\n• L-dopa and carbidopa can aggravate and speed up the progress of Parkinson's disease in\nmany cases, and is said to have little beneficial effect in over half the cases.\n(Shaking Palsy, Paralysis agitans,\nParkinsonianism)\nSYMPTOMS—Initially: mild to moderate tremor of the hand or hands while at rest, a feeling of being\nslow and heavy, tendency to tire more easily, muscular stiffness, loss of skill in the fingers and thumb\n(writing, buttoning and unbuttoning, playing the piano, etc.)\nLater: depression, loss of appetite, muscular rigidity, permanent rigid stoop, shuffling gait, drooling,\ntremors, fixed facial expression, and impaired speech. Ability to maintain balance may be affected.\nThe body gradually becomes rigid as limbs stiffen. Dementia may occur.\nPrinciple signs are tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, and slow or retarded movement. Tremors and\nslowness generally begin in one limb, then progress to the other limb on the same side; later still to the\nother side. Usually the hands are affected before the feet.\nCAUSES—Parkinson's disease is a gradual degeneration of the nervous system. The nerve cells in the\nbasal ganglion of the brain are gradually destroyed.\nParkinson's disease is one of the most common debilitating diseases in the United States. But actual\ndisability usually does not occur for 10-15 years after onset of symptoms.\nAlthough the underlying cause is not known, symptoms appear when there is a lack of dopamine in the\nbrain. Dopamine is made by the body, and carries messages from one nerve cell to another. Normally,\nanother neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is made, to keep dopamine in balance. When there is not enough\nacetylcholine, myasthenia gravis occurs; when there is not enough dopamine, the result is Parkinson's\ndisease.\nIn Parkinson's, the problem generally is destruction of the cells which make dopamine. But sometimes\nthe cause is blockage of the dopamine receptors in the brain.\nOne possible cause of this disorder is that too many toxins have been released in the body for the blood\nto filter out through the liver. An excess of chemicals, drugs, toxins in meat eating, etc., are thought to\nbe involved. It is known that one of the chemicals in heroine directly destroys the key brain cells\npreventing Parkinson's. A chronic poor diet, over many years, is also considered to be a significant\nfactor.",

    "title": "Polio",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• In the late 1940s, Benjamin Sandler, M.D., was interviewed on the radio in the spring,\njust before the summer polio season. He declared that, if sugar foods and especially Cokes\nand soft drinks were avoided, polio would not be contracted. This went into the\nnewspapers and the East Coast area covered by the announcement had very little polio\nthat summer. Later, Sandler wrote a book detailing his concept.\nSugar injures the nerves; calcium is needed by the nerves; highly acid substances remove\ncalcium; phosphorous locks with calcium and carries it off, making it unavailable. Coca\nCola-type drinks combine all these special qualities! The liquid in Coke is more acid than\nvinegar, yet is not noticed because of the very high sugar content. Coke is phosphoric\nacid. So the sugar and acid eat away the calcium, and the phosphorus immediately locks\ninto it. A tooth, dropped in a glass of Coke, will melt away in a matter of hours.\n• Another factor is being cold. People drink Cokes and other soft drinks at swimming\npools, then jump and in and vigorously swim in the cold water. So many people contract\npolio at swimming pools in the summer that it is suspected that there must be something\nin the pool water. But the problem is the soft drinks, not contaminated pool water.\n• The body is adapted to the intense heat of mid-summer; but poor diet plus soft drinks\nweaken it, then the cold plunge intensifies the effects.\n• Because it was so dangerous to the health, Coca Cola was banned from interstate\ncommerce by the original Food and Drug Administration early in the 20th century. That is\nwhy, to this day, Cokes and Pepsi's are made in local bottling plants. The syrup is shipped\ninterstate, and then, with water, is poured into bottles.\n• Franklin D. Roosevelt was very athletic. He fought a forest fire near his home, ate some\njunk food, and jumped in an ice-cold river to cool off. He then came down with polio.\n• Another factor is keeping the body warm.\n• As soon as a person comes down with polio, he is placed in bed and observed. —But,\nwhat should be done is to place him immediately in a warm, full bathtub or, better, give\nhim the \"Kenny packs.\"\n• Nurse Kenny (called Sister Kenny, because nurses in Australia are called \"sister\")\napplied hot packs to the patients (on parts, or all, of their bodies), and eliminated polio\nwith few or no after effects. But this water therapy method was not permitted in America.\nIt was too effective.\nOther factors:\n• During the infectious stage, keep the diet high in protein and potassium, to replace that\nwhich is lost because of tissue destruction.\n• Fluid, caloric, and sodium intake should also be increased because of the fever.\nAdditional B vitamins are also needed, along with vitamins A and C.\n• Give antispasmodic tincture (which see). Give doses (according to age) of 8-15 drops in\n1/4th glass of hot water.\n• Helpful herbs include prickly ash berries, wild cherry bark, valerian root, skullcap,\ngoldenseal, black cohosh, red clover, catnip, and yellow dock.\n• Dr. Salk, himself (developer of injectable polio vaccine), warned against the serious\ndangers in taking oral polio vaccine! Beware of oral polio vaccine! In the latter part of the\n20th century, oral polio vaccine has produced more cases of polio than any other agency.\n• In addition, there is extreme danger in handling the bowel movement of an infant who\nhas received the oral polio vaccine! You can get crippling polio from doing so.\n• Medical history reveals that people who were vegetarians, did not eat junk foods, or\ndrink soft drinks, but lived a clean life—and avoided polio vaccines; and those recently\nreceiving them—have rarely contracted polio.\n(Poliomyelitis, Infantile Paralysis)\nSYMPTOMS—Fever, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and irritability.\nIncubation is generally 2-7 days, and onset is often abrupt. There may be digestive disturbance, plus a\nslight elevation of temperature, usually for not more than 3 days. Then paralysis may, or may not,\ndevelop.\nBend the person's neck forward. If it aches, polio may be coming on.\nCAUSES—Poliomyelitis means \"gray marrow,\" and is inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal\ncord. The condition is not confined to infancy, nor is paralysis always involved. Polio is a virus infection\nof the spinal cord which destroys the nerves controlling muscular movement, often resulting in paralysis\nof certain muscles.\nThe first of two stages of polio is the infectious stage, when the virus is active. The second is the\nnoninfectious stage, when recovery may occur.\nParalysis may be confined to a small part of the body or much, or nearly all, of it. But muscle atrophy\nmay also occur. Death usually only occurs in bulbar and respiratory cases. Aside from\nbronchopneumonia, other complications are relatively few.\nEpidemics, when they occur, usually reach their peak during the warmest months (July and August).",

The rate at which\nthe ability to distinguish strong odors diminishes is an indicator of how rapidly an individual will lose\nmental functioning. (But smokers have already lost part of this sense, so the diagnostic test does not\nwork as well when applied to them.)\nCAUSES—Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration. Memory and thought processes\nare weakened and disoriented.\nNerve fibers, leading into, and out of, the hippocampus in the brain become tangled and short circuited.\nAs a result, information is no longer carried to, and from, the brain. New memories cannot be gained,\nand old memories cannot be retrieved.\nIn addition, plaques of a certain protein (beta-amyloid) build up in the brain, damaging nerve cells.\nOne form of Alzheimer's occurs between 36 and 45, and is quite rapid. The more gradual form develops\nin those who are 65 or 70.\nSimple forgetfulness is not Alzheimer's. If you do not remember your wife's name, that is forgetfulness;\nif you forget you have a wife, that is dementia (of which Alzheimer's is a form).\nThere are other disorders which produce similar symptoms: Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries),\nwhich slowly reduces blood flow to the brain; a series of minor strokes; hypothyroidism; advanced\nsyphilis.\nMany elderly people are taking 8 or 10 medicinal drugs. This drugging will surely affect the brain. You\ncan see the effects in nursing homes across the continent. Add to this a devitalized diet of fried,\nprocessed, and junk food.\nOther causes include heavy metals in the body. One in particular stands out: When you hear the words,\n\"Alzheimer's disease,\" think of it as \"aluminum disease,\" for this is what it often is.\nAutopsies on persons who died with Alzheimer's reveal accumulations of up to 4 times the normal\namount of aluminum in the nerve cells of the brain. Significantly, especially high concentrations are in,\nand around, the hippocampus.\n(See \"Aluminum Poisoning\" for much more information.)\nBut those with Alzheimer's also have high levels of mercury in their brain. Beware of amalgam dental\nfillings. Mercury from the fillings gradually passes into the body and, over a period of time, accumulates\nin the brain.\nObtaining an adequate supply of minerals in the diet helps keep heavy metals from accumulating in the\nbody.\nWomen with Alzheimer's have lower estrogen levels than normal.\nFree radicals are another factor. Avoid foods which contain them.\nThose with Alzheimer's have low levels of vitamin B and zinc in their bodies. All the B complex\n12\nvitamins are important.\nVitamins A and E, important antioxidant vitamins, are also important.\nLevels of choline and ethanolamine are lower in those with Alzheimer's.\nUndergo a trial of intensive nutritional therapy, especially B injections. This may ward off the\n12\ndeveloping problem.\nThose with Alzheimer's tend to have a strong craving for sweets. But such a craving is frequently an\nindication of a food hunger for vitamins and minerals.\nSome people with Down's syndrome (which see) live to be in their 30s or 40s; they usually develop\nAlzheimer's.",

Many people in advanced age are quite clear in their thought processes.\n(But there are actually two types of dementia: Primary dementia comes on gradually, without apparent\ncause. Secondary dementia comes on suddenly from brain injury, operation, drugs, or diabetic coma; is\nusually reversible. Senility and Alzheimer's are examples of primary dementia.)\nCommon causes of senility include poor blood circulation to, and in, the brain, cerebral arteriosclerosis,\nheavy metal toxicity, prolonged nutritional deficiency, prolonged use of medicinal drugs, and lack of\nexercise and fresh air.\nCalcification and fatty cholesterol deposits in the middle cerebral artery reduces the main blood supply\nto the brain, resulting in a poor oxygen supply to the brain. This produces a loss of memory and typical\n\"senile\" changes.\nThe experts tell us that, over a matter of years, wearing uncomfortable collars and neckties tend to cause\neddies in the carotid arteries, contributing to the deposition of cholesterol.\nMany of those diagnosed as senile are actually suffering from the effects of medicinal drugs. Avoid\ndrugs throughout your life, if you want a happy old age. But hearing, thyroid, liver, or kidney problems\ncan also produce apparent memory loss.

Nutritional deficiencies have a strong effect on mental health.\n• Autointoxication and constipation are contributing factors in mental illness. Symptoms\nwhich are alleviated range from mental sluggishness to hallucinations. Even schizophrenia\n(which see) can be greatly lessened.\n• There is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is\nclogged, mental illness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in\nothers.\n• Eliminate the \"glue foods\"; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous\nand toxins in it, and lead to mental problems. Such foods include white flour, sugar, eggs,\nmeat, peanuts, and dairy products.\n• Brain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients (see \"Nerves,\nStrengthening\").\n• It is known that many cases of mental illness are solved when a simple, nourishing, diet,\nincluding sufficient fiber and adequate vitamins and minerals, are given and the colon is\ncleaned out with enemas or colonics.\n• A high-carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the\nbrain, and produces a calming, peaceful, feeling.\n• Exercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps\nrejuvenate the body and mind.\n• Allergy specialists successfully treat individuals with mental illness by isolating foods\nand chemicals in the environment which induce the mental problems. Allergic reactions\nmay be a factor in criminal behavior. In some cases, the offending food does not cause\nmental reactions until hours after being eaten. This is called \"masked food allergy.\" Do\nnot under-rate the allergy factor!

The orthodox methods\nuse various tranquilizers, all with severe side effects—electroconvulsive shock therapy\nand psychotherapy. Orthodox remedial substances deplete many essential vitamins, are\nhighly toxic, damage brain tissue, and should be avoided.\n• Using natural remedies, which are far broader in scope, solutions are much more likely.\n• The primary areas of treatment are discussed above.\n• Go on a fruit and vegetable juice diet for a time. This will provide vitamins and minerals\nwhile keeping the blood sugar normal during the fast. Repeat short juice fasts or one\nlonger one for 4-6 weeks. Overly sweet fruit juices should be avoided or diluted 50-50\nwith water.\n• During this time, give massive doses of niacin, in the form of niacinamide (1,000-3,000\nmg with each meal; often as much as 25,000-30,000 mg per day). An equal amount of\nvitamin C should be given, B vitamins, especially pantothenic acid, and 3-5 tbsp. of\nbrewer's yeast.\n• After recovery, a large daily dose of niacinamide will have to be continued indefinitely.\n• Repeat: Do not give massive doses of niacin, but rather in the form of niacinamide.\n• Avoid all processed, junk, and fried foods. Do not use white flour or sugar foods. Stop\neating meat. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.\n• Eat a high-fiber diet, including plenty of fresh raw vegetables and quality protein.\nComplex carbohydrates in the diet are important to keep the blood sugar level.\n—Also see \"Mental Illness\" and \"Nerves, Strengthening\" for much additional information.\n(Paranoic, Catatonic, Hebephrenic; Dementia Praecox)\nSYMPTOMS—Principle signs are moodiness, solitary habits, stupor and excitement, delusions and\nhallucinations.\nHallucinations common, especially of hearing. Loss of emotion or, if shown, it is out of place. Actions\nare absent or inappropriate. There may be impulsive destructive acts and negativism. Extremities tend to\nbe cold, blue, and edematous (puffy with fluids). Conscious, but takes little cognizance of what is going\non about him. Delusions frequent but absurd, often of grandeur and persecution. May have attacks of\ntears or laughter. There may be excited activity. May remain in a stupor. Grimaces and mannerisms are\nfrequent. Symptoms sometimes change form.\nSchizophrenia affects about 3% of the population at some time in their lives.\nCAUSES—This is the most important of the psychoses, and is characterized by a loss of contact with\nthe environment and by a disintegration of personality. The earlier name for it was dementia praecox.\nThere are four primary types. A vague sense of being two personalities and \"changed\" occurs in all\ntypes:\n1 - Simple schizophrenia: The person becomes dull emotionally, loses ambition, and tends to withdraw.\nYet there is no serious intellectual impairment.\n2 - Paranoid schizophrenia: The person develops extensive delusions of persecution. He believes people\nare plotting against him.\n3 - Catatonic schizophrenia: The person may show stereotyped excitement or simulate a stupor. But he\nwill clearly remember it, if he later recovers.\n4 - Hebephrenic schizophrenia: There are mannerisms, speech anomalies, hysteroid symptoms,\ndelusions, hallucinations, and often a dreamy, ineffectual reaction.\nSome believe schizophrenia is hereditary; others think that only attitudinal, dietetic, and external factors\nlead to it (head injuries, complications during birth, reaction to a virus or medicinal drug, environmental\npoisons).\nA wide range of medicinal drugs can produce schizoid symptoms. It is known that many schizophrenics\nhad birth complications or a head injury in childhood.\nSchizophrenia is also linked to an excess of copper in the body. High copper levels cause vitamin C and\nzinc levels to drop. It is believed that a zinc deficiency may be a key factor inducing schizophrenia. A\nfull 80% of those with this disorder have a deficiency of zinc and an excess of copper and iron in their\nbody tissues. Supplementation of zinc and manganese are needed to correct this.\nZinc deficiencies occur more frequently in the winter, and this is when this disorder frequently begins.\nIt is now known that some individuals who, later in life are schizophrenic, had a prenatal zinc\ndeficiency, from their mother's diet and way of life.\nThe pineal gland in the brain normally has high levels of zinc, and weakening of this endocrine gland\nmay be a factor.\nMagnesium deficiency may also be involved, since schizophrenics have lower magnesium levels in their\nblood; and, when they recover from it, their magnesium levels are higher.\nHypoglycemia appears to be frequently involved in schizophrenia. A fair level supply of blood sugar is\nvital, if oxygen is going to be regularly provided to the brain. Yet it is believed that an undersupply of\noxygen is a key factor inducing the disorder. (See \"Hypoglycemia.\")\nHigh-quality food, with emphasis on slow-to-digest whole grain products, should be eaten.\nMineral and trace mineral imbalances exist in schizophrenics. A nourishing diet, along with vitamin/\nmineral supplementation is needed.\nSevere vitamin B (niacin) deficiency (pellagra), with its characteristics such as nervousness, loss of\n3\nmemory, confusion, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and hallucinations—resembles schizophrenia so\nclosely, that the two disorders probably are the same.\nHere is an interesting fact: When experiments were made on prisoners, and they were given no niacin\nfor extended periods of time before they were again given normal diets, it required 60 times as much\nniacin to return them to normal, in order to prevent pellagra.\nSevere deficiencies of other B complex vitamins can also produce schizoid symptoms. Severe B\n12\ndeficiency caused difficulty in concentration, poor memory, agitation, hallucinations, and manic or\nparanoid behavior. Biotin deficiency causes depression, lassitude, panic, and hallucinations.\nFaulty essential fatty acid metabolism or deficiency is another factor leading to schizophrenia. The\nremedy was 2-6 tbsp. of linseed oil, in divided doses, given daily. Flaxseed oil, wheat germ oil, or\nsunflower seed oil work just as effectively.\nAnother factor is heavy metal poisoning. This would include lead, copper, mercury,",

Also\nsee osteomalacia under \"Rickets,\" which is sometimes misdiagnosed as osteoporosis.\n(Brittle Bones)\nSYMPTOMS—There is skeletal pain (especially in the hip and back), deformities (such as a hump in\nthe upper back), a stooping and rounding of the shoulders, increased susceptibility to fractures, and a\nreduction in height. Do you find that your clothes are getting bigger?\nUnfortunately, symptoms are frequently not very obvious until the bones are quite weak.\nCAUSES—Osteoporosis is a reduction in the total mass of bone, so that the remaining bone is fragile or\n\"brittle.\" This weakening continues to increase. The bones actually become thinner. Bone formation is\nslowed; bone reabsorption increases, causing this loss of bone mass.\nAbout 25-30% of all white females in the U.S. reveal symptoms of this condition, especially after\nmenopause. Older men, above 50, also have it, but to a lesser degree than women. Osteoporosis is rare in\nblack men, but somewhat more common in black women.\nWhite women in America tend to lose 30-40% of their bone mass between 55-70.\nBut younger women should be watchful; research indicates that osteoporosis often begins early in life\nrather than just after menopause. (However, bone loss definitely accelerates after that time, due to a drop\nin estrogen levels.)\nPeople with larger and denser bones tend to have less trouble with osteoporosis later in life. They started\nout with more bony structure.\nA major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb\ncalcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of\ncertain hormones.\nStill other factors include late puberty, early menopause (natural or artificially induced), chronic liver or\nkidney disease, and the long-term use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and antiseizure medications.\nSmoking is an excellent way to damage your bones.\nCompression fractures in the vertebrae occur as bone loss advances. This causes a loss in height and\ncrowds the nerves, resulting in pain. Nerve damage is possible. Older women often have a hump in the\nupper back as a result.\nOsteoporosis can also result in loose teeth which fall out, because the jawbone has weakened.\nThere are two types of this disease:\nOsteoporosis, Type I, is thought to be caused by hormonal changes, especially a loss of estrogen.\nOsteoporosis, Type II, traces its cause to dietary factors (lack of calcium, vitamin D, etc.), poor\nabsorption, and intake of foods which block absorption.",

There may be delayed walking, tetany, bony beads along the ribs, and\ndecaying teeth.\nIn adults, in addition to the above symptoms, aching joints and generalized weakness may also occur.\nCAUSES—Rickets is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D in children. When it occurs in adults, it is\ncalled osteomalacia.\nIt can result either from not obtaining enough vitamin D in the food or from not getting enough sunlight.\nWhen sunlight strikes the skin, oils there are irradiated, reabsorbed into the blood stream and carried to\nthe liver, where it is stored and sent throughout the body to strengthen the bones. Without this vitamin,\nthe body cannot absorb calcium and phosphorous.\nThe bones cannot retain calcium, so they become soft. This results in deformities when the bones are\nrequired to support weight. Yet weight gain and growth will usually be normal.\nThe adult form, osteomalacia, generally occurs during pregnancy or breast-feeding. But it may also be\ncaused by a kidney disease or defect, calcium deficiency, a lack of vitamin D, or inability to utilize it. It\ncan also occur in those who do not obtain enough sunshine or whose bodies are so low in fat that they\ncannot produce the bile needed to absorb the vitamin D in the food.\nA deficiency of vitamin C can make the bones less able to retain bone-building minerals.\nOsteomalacia is often misdiagnosed as osteoporosis (which see).",

Immense pain in the affected area, which frequently limits motion.\nIt most often occurs in shoulder joint and less often in the hip joint, in the elbows, or feet.\nCAUSES—Bursitis is the inflammation of the liquid-filled sac, called a bursa, found within joints,\nmuscles, tendons, and bones. These sacs normally help muscular movement occur.\nOverstimulation of the bursa causes the synovial membrane to produce excess fluid. This distends the\nbursa, which causes the discomfort.\nInjury to the area is a common cause, but chilling of the area during the day, especially at night can also\nlead to it. Bursitis can also be caused by chronic overuse, calcium deposits in the bursa wall, reactions to\ncertain foods or airborne allergies. In some instances, suddenly working tight muscles can do it; it is\ncalled a stretched muscle.\nAccording to where it is centered, bursitis has many names: housemaid's knee, tennis elbow, policeman's\nheel, frozen shoulder, or beat knee.\nThe lowly bunion (caused by friction in tight shoes) is also a form of bursitis. A bursa sac on the joint of\nthe big toe becomes inflamed.\nAthletes and older people are most likely to get bursitis, but it can happen to anyone at any age.\nWhat is the difference between bursitis and tendonitis (which see)? Both produce pain in the shoulder,\netc.\nBursitis generally exhibits a dull persistent ache that increases with movement. Tendonitis causes a\nsharp pain during movement, and is most likely to be caused to over-reaching for something. But it can\nalso be caused by calcium deposits pressing against a tendon.

Prop up the leg, wrap it with an Ace bandage, and place the ice pack on it for 20-\n30 minutes.\n• An alternate method is a contrast bath of one minute, of ice, followed by a minute of\nheat. Do this for at least 12 minutes. This is especially good for pain in the inner leg\n(rather than the front where the shin splints occur).\n• Massage the area near the shin splint pain, but not on it. If you rub on it, the\ninflammation will worsen. Sit on the floor and lightly stroke on the sides several times.\nThen wrap your hands around the calf and, with your finger tips, stroke deeply around on\neach side of the shin from ankle to knee. Do the entire area, pressing as deeply as possible.\n• Try to correct flat feet or very high arches, if you can. They can also cause shin splints.\nPREVENTION—Try to avoid a lot of hard activity on unyielding surfaces, such as concrete. Even\ncarpet on concrete can cause problems. Grass or dirt is better than asphalt; asphalt is better than\nconcrete.\nWear good, comfortable shoes; and when they start wearing down, buy new ones.\nStretch your calves and Achilles tendon frequently. This helps prevent shin splints. Shortened calf\nmuscles throw more weight and stress forward to the shins.\nTo stretch your calves, place your hands on a wall, extend one leg behind the other, and press the back\nheel slowly to the floor. Do this 20 times, and repeat on the other leg.\nTo stretch your Achilles tendons, have both feet flat on the ground, about 6 inches apart. Bend your\nankles and knees forward while keeping the back straight. When you achieve tightness, hold it for 30\nseconds. Repeat 10 times.\nSYMPTOMS—Pain in the shins of one or both legs. There may, or may not, be a specific area of\ntenderness; pain, and aching will be felt in the front of the lower leg after, or during, activity.\nCAUSES—The experts are not clear as what shin splints are. They may be an irritation to the tendon\nwhich attaches the muscle to the bone. Or they may be a muscle irritation or the beginning of a stress\nfracture.\nActive people have shin splints. For example, 28% of long distance runners have them and 22% of\naerobic dancers.\nThey are caused by excessive walking, running, or jumping on a hard surface. But other factors include\npoor shoes, fallen arches, insufficient warm-up, poor posture, faulty walking and running techniques, or\noverstraining.\nSometimes the early stages of stress fractures are thought to be shin splints or vice verse. But there is a\ndifference: Stress fractures begin pinpoint pain, about the size of a dime or quarter, around or on a bony\narea. A shin splint is a generalized pain or aching discomfort up and down the whole shin. But, if the\nproblem is not stopped, shin splints can develop into stress fractures.",

Avoid vegetable oils\nalso. Because of the connection between claudication and blood vessel diseases, the life\nyou save may be your own (see \"Arteriosclerosis\" and related articles on the heart and\nblood vessels).\n• Using nicotine is ruinous to the health in several ways; choking off circulation to the\nlimbs is one of them. Those who smoke are 6 times more likely to develop claudication\n(also see Buerger's Disease).\n• It appears that abnormally high blood viscosity can be a primary cause of poor blood\nflow. The solution is to drink lots of water and use a diet low in fats, sugars, and\nconcentrated foods; that is, those which have a very low moisture content.\n• Stress also reduces blood viscosity, so avoid stress.\n• A regular exercise program is very helpful, especially for those who do it every day. See\n\"Muscle Cramps\" for some sample exercises. Ten repetitions of the exercises should be\ndone at least once a day.\n• In addition to other exercises, take a daily walk. Build up to a total of an hour, each\nmorning and evening.\n• For those who can take them, hot baths are helpful. Always keep the head cool with cool\nwashcloths that are changed frequently.\n• Helpful herbs include ginseng and cayenne.\n—Also see \"Muscle Cramps,\" which, in the legs, have the same symptoms. Also see \"Arteriosclerosis\"\nand related articles.\n(Intermittent Claudication)\nSYMPTOMS—Cramping pain, weakness, and tension in a limb (usually the calves) after muscular\nexercise. Upon resting, the pain always ceases. Typically, after a few moments of rest, the person can\nbegin walking again.\nCAUSES—Intermittent claudication (also simply called claudication) is often a symptom of something\nmore serious: arteriosclerosis of the femoral and popliteal arteries. Other causes include Buerger's\ndisease (which see), or other occlusive arterial diseases of the limbs. Diabetics tend to have claudication\nmore than the average.\nHigh blood pressure (above 160 systolic or 90 diastolic) triples the risk of claudication (see\n\"Hypertension\").\nDiagnosis of claudication is done by a physician, by taking the \"pedal pulse.\" This is the pulse at the\ninstep of each foot. These pulses should be strong and equal, but if one or both is weak or absent, then\nthere is claudication.",

The emotions have a powerful effect on the body.\nThose experiencing this problem frequently have shallow sleep. Muscle spasms and pain in various\nplaces may occur at night (or during the day).\nThen there are the so-called \"tender points.\" These symptoms are unique to this disease, unlike any other\ndisease. There are 9 pairs of specific points where muscles are especially sensitive to the touch. Here are\nthose 9 locations:\nIn muscles at base of skull, neck, upper back, or mid-back. On the side of the elbow, around the lower\nvertebra of the neck, at the insertion of the second rib, in the upper and outer muscles of the buttocks,\naround the upper part of the thigh bone, at the middle of the knee joint.\nThose with fibromyalgia experience so many sleep problems (apnea, bruxism, restless leg syndrome,\netc.), that they often have chronic fatigue.\nThe symptoms often begin in young adulthood, develop gradually, and slowly increase in intensity until\nmany become incapacitated by the problem.\nSometimes the syndrome disappears; other times it is chronic; and, in some cases, it is comes back in\nrecurring flare-ups.\nThe cause is not really known, but chronic depression of spirits seems to be involved.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (which see) is similar to fibromyalgia, but the former is keyed to chronic\nfatigue and the latter to chronic pain.",

For example, push-ups from the knees will strengthen\nthe abdominal muscles.\n• You may wish to try an astringent tea: Make a very strong tea of white oak bark,\nconsisting of one cup of finely broken bark to one quart of water.

Too much sugar\nshocks the adrenal cortex, and the resulting physical reaction is to crave still more sugar.\n• Stop eating or using meat, nicotine, alcohol, chocolate, soft drinks, black tea, and\nsugared and fat foods. Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco produce wide swings in blood sugar\nlevels.\n• Read the labels at the grocery store, and avoid dextrose, dextrin, lactose, maltose,\nsucrose, fructose, modified food starch, corn syrup, corn sweetener, cornstarch, and\nnatural sweetener. Only use honey and molasses in small amounts. Also stay away from\nsorbitol, hexanol, mannitol, and glycol.\n• Too much salt also exhausts the adrenals and causes a loss of potassium, leading to\nlower blood sugar.\n• Eat natural foods, the ones you should have been eating to begin with. Whole grains, raw\nand simply cooked vegetables, some fresh fruit. But eat in moderation starchy foods, such\nas corn, noodles, pasta, white rice, hominy, and yams.\n• Eat a high-fiber diet and vegetables that are raw or steamed. These are good for you:\nbeans, lentils, brown rice, white potatoes, soy products, and fruits.\n• Useful fruits include apricots, apples, bananas, grapefruit, lemons, cantaloupes, and\npersimmons. For example, eat a raw apple instead of applesauce, for the apple has more\nfiber which will help keep blood sugar stabilized.\n• Licorice acts like cortin and helps the blood sugar. Bilberry and wild yam help control\ninsulin levels. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Spirulina tablets, taken between meals,\nhelp stabilize blood sugar.\n• During a blood sugar reaction, eat something that has both fiber and protein, such as rice\nor bran crackers with almond butter. Fiber alone (popcorn, rice, oat bran, crackers, ground\nflaxseed, and psyllium husks) has the ability to slow down a hypoglycemic reaction. A\nhalf hour before each meal, eat some of this high fiber, to stabilize blood sugar.\n• Once a month, go on a fresh vegetable juice fast for a day. Take enemas with some\nadded lemon juice at that time. If a reaction starts to occur, reach for the fiber, protein\npowder, or spirulina.\n• Avoid stressful situations. You may have a milk allergy, which often accompanies this\ndisease.\n(Low Blood Sugar)\nSYMPTOMS—Confusion, depression, nervousness, anxiety, antisocial behavior, emotional instability,\nexhaustion, headaches, impatience, inability to cope, fears, craving for sugar, faintness, dizziness.\nSymptoms especially occur a few hours after eating sweets or fats. The more that is eaten and the longer\nthe span before the symptoms occur, the worse they are.\nCAUSES—The problem is adrenal exhaustion. The cause is too much stress, worry, and an excess of\nundigested sugars, starches, proteins, and dairy products. The cortin hormone is depleted, so food cannot\nbe digested properly.\nPeople consume large quantities of sugars, caffeine, soft drinks, and alcohol. These all contain simple\nsugars, and insufficient amounts of complex carbohydrates. Add to this: high stress levels, and the two\nadrenal glands become exhausted.\nHypoglycemia can be inherited, but more often it is brought on by an inadequate diet (and is then called\nfunctional hypoglycemia). However, there are several other physical problems which can weaken\nadrenal function and help bring on hypoglycemia. These include weaknesses in the thyroid, liver,\nkidneys, pituitary, and pancreas. Immune deficiency and candidiasis can also lead to it. Other causes\ninclude smoking and large amounts of caffeine.\nHypoglycemia is sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as asthma, allergies, fatigue syndrome, stomach,\nintestinal, weight problems, or mental or nervous disorders.\nHalf the people, over 50, who have hypoglycemia, are hypothyroid.",

Those drugs cause\nthem to shrink in size and not work properly.

Avoid tobacco, alcohol, etc.\n—Also see \"Birth Defects\" for more information on cystic fibrosis.\nSYMPTOMS—The symptoms are first seen in very small children. Large amounts of thick mucous\ndevelops in the lungs, blocking lung passages and causing difficult breathing, chronic coughing and\nwheezing, and lung infections.\nThere are digestive problems, inadequate absorption of fats, after-meal stomach pain, and thinness. Body\nsweat will have very large amounts of sodium, potassium, and chloride salts. Any, or all, of these\nsymptoms may occur.\nCAUSES—In 1938, this physical problem was named \"cystic fibrosis\" because it was mistakenly\nthought that abnormal changes in the pancreas were true cysts (tiny pockets of fluid lined with normal\ntissue). But it was later discovered that those spots were just part of the shrinking process of the\npancreas, as the disease worsened.\nThere are three views of the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF):\n1 - CF is an inherited disease, which the sufferer must learn to live with.\n2 - CF is caused by inadequate absorption of selenium, zinc, essential fatty acids, and other minerals\n(including trace minerals) as a result of subclinical celiac disease. (Celiac disease is the inability to\ndigest wheat and some other foods.)\n3 - Dr. Joel Wallach, a veterinarian, who in 1978 was the first to diagnose CF in a laboratory animal, by\nnoting characteristic CF changes in the pancreas and liver of baby monkeys, says he was fired when it\nwas discovered that he could reproduce those CF changes in the body by giving or withholding the\nelement, selenium. He had shown that CF was a nutritional problem which could be solved if caught\nearly enough. (See Let's Play Doctor, J.D. Wallach, D.V.M., N.D., pp. 109-110. See order sheet.)\n\"The prevention of CF has been accomplished in pet, farm and laboratory animals by the veterinary\nprofession by assuring adequate levels of selenium and essential fatty acid nutrition to the pregnant and\nnursing mother. This is not as easy as it sounds because of malabsorption problems (i.e., celiac disease\nand Crohn's disease) in a percentage of women. All things being normal, a supplementation of 200 mcg\nselenium per day and 5 gm of flaxseed oil, three times a day [to the pregnant and nursing mother], would\nbe adequate to prevent CF.\n\"Treatment of CF is very basic: treat the infant as early as possible with selenium IM [given\nintramuscularly] at 10-25 mcg per day.\"—Op cit., p. 109.\nHe adds that it is vital that it be determined if the infant is allergic to wheat, cow's milk or soy milk, so\nas to avoid what he is allergic to.\nWe might conclude that all three theories are correct; in that, if you give the mother and infant proper\nsupplementation, the disease can be eliminated at the beginning of the child's life.\nBut if this is not done, he will thereafter not be able to absorb nutrients properly, will exhibit the\nsymptoms of CF, and will have to cope with the problem the rest of his life.\nHowever, Wallach says that, even later, the person can lead a more normal life if he regularly receives\nessential fatty acids, intravenously, and selenium, intramuscularly.\n\"The lungs of CF patients are normal at birth and only develop bronchiectasis after chronic essential\nfatty acid and copper deficiencies have taken their toll.\"—Ibid.\n\"CF . . is preventable, 100% curable in the early stages, and can be far better managed in chronic cases\nthan it is currently managed by `orthodox' medicine.\"—Op. cit., p. 108.",

Pharmacies have it, but will\nnot dispense it without a prescription.\n• Of course, there is also iodized salt. The problem here is that aluminum is in store-\nbought salt (so it will not cake), and that can lead to Alzheimer's disease (which see).\n• Some turn to \"sea salt,\" but generally this is nothing more than regular salt, extracted\nfrom the ocean rather than from salt mines. It is just regular salt!\n• Some use rock salt (from salt mines), and grind it up. But this lacks the iodine.\n• There is a firm in France which produces salt from the ocean which does have all the\nnatural trace minerals, including iodine: The U.S. address is Grain & Salt Society, P.O.\nBox DD, Magalia, CA 95954 / 916-872-5800. Of the three products (Light Grey, Fine\nGround, and Flower of the Ocean), the Fine Ground seems to strike a balance between\nfine grain and low price. The salt is slightly moist, but this is natural. Dry, free-flowing,\nsalt has always been treated with chemicals.\n• I recommend that you use both Nova Scotia dulse and this French sea salt at every meal.\n• For some, thyroid problems can be corrected, but for others it is something to live with,\nfor a lifetime, while doing that which may lessen the problem. In addition to taking added\niodine, eat a nutritious diet. The experts say to only eat in moderation the cabbage family\n(broccoli, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, mustard greens), for they tend to suppress the\nthyroid function. The same is said to hold true for peaches and pears.\n• Chlorine, fluoride, and iodine are chemically related, and block entrance of iodine into\nthe thyroid. So avoid chlorinated water, fluoridated water, and toothpaste.\n• A thyroid deficiency can result from lack of sunshine and free fats (margarine, butter,\nmayonnaise, fried foods, cooking fats, salad oils, and peanut butter).\n• Functions of the thyroid will be increased by more exercise, for it stimulates TSH\nproduction by the pituitary. T3 increases slowly in the blood during, and after, vigorous\nexercise.\n• Mother's milk is a good treatment for hypothyroid babies, and it helps protect normal\nbabies from developing the problem until weaning.\n• Vitamin A is necessary for iodine to be properly absorbed; the B vitamins work together,\nto nourish the thyroid; B helps the thyroid use its iodine effectively in hormone\n6\nproduction; B helps the thyroid work properly.\n12\n• To stimulate the thyroid: Eat one serving each of oats and bananas daily, take a cool\nshower each morning and night, and work 3-5 hours out-of-doors every day.\n• Avoid electric blankets if you can.\n• Use a salt-free, oil-free, sugar-free diet until the thyroid is under control. But, on the long\nterm, you need a little salt and oil.\n• In cretins, who are born hypothyroid, try taking them off the thyroid medication after\nthree years of supplementation. Maybe their thyroid will start functioning on its own.\n• A nature healer in Central America recommends the following procedures:\n• To go off thyroid supplementation: Go on a fasting, cleansing program of fruit and\nvegetable juices, followed by a building program of eating simple nourishing foods\n(especially raw food). Do this for 2-4 weeks. Get back and neck spinal adjustments, and\ntake one kelp tablet daily. He says this always works.\nGOITER—He also recommends this:\nTo eliminate goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland): Follow the above program; and then, after the 2-4\nweeks, do one or more of the following four neck applications: (1) Put an Epsom salt compress on the\nneck every night, and leave it on all night for 10 nights. (2) Use a compress of white oak bark tea over\nthe goiter for better results. (3) Put two hot fomentations around the neck, for 4 minutes each and one\ncold compress for 4 minutes. Continue alternating this for an hour. Then spend 5-10 minutes doing\nexercises with the neck in various positions. (4) Put a poultice of ground-up almonds completely around\nthe neck and leave it on all night, for 3-10 nights. This is especially good for harder, more fibrous,\ngoiters.\nNitrates are goitrogenic; that is, they stimulate goiter formation. Nitrates can be found in hot dogs,\nsausages, luncheon meats, and variously prepared meat products. Nitrates are also found in well water,\nfrom fertilizer runoff.\nInterestingly enough, many people with Parkinson's disease (which see) tend to have hypothyroidism.\n(Underactive Thyroid; Goiter)\nSYMPTOMS—Fatigue and inability to tolerate cold are the most common symptoms.\nOthers include: loss of appetite, a slow heart rate, muscle weakness and possible cramps, dry and scaly\nskin, recurrent infections, water retention (edema) and overweight, brittle nails, constipation, depression,\ndifficulty in concentrating, a yellow-orange coloration of the skin (especially on the palms of the hands).\nIn women, there might be painful menstruation, a milky breast discharge, and fertility problems.\nCAUSES—The thyroid gland is the body's thermostat. It tells the rest of the body when to produce more\nheat or less. Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck),\nand affects several body functions, including the general rate of metabolism. The pituitary, located in the\ncenter of the skull, sends out TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), to tell the thyroid to speed up or slow\ndown. When a weak thyroid does not respond, TSH levels remain high—and you have hypothyroidism.\nThe hormone, thyroxine, is almost pure iodine.\nFirst thing in the morning, place a thermometer under your arm for 15 minutes while keeping still. A\ntemperature of 97.6o F. or lower may indicate an underactive thyroid. Write down the result for five\ndays. (Others say that if the test is consistently below 98, you are low thyroid.)\nA low thyroid condition generally does not produce goiter (which see). If you had goiter, your thyroid\ngland would enlarge.\nIt is thought that Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. This occurs\nwhen the body becomes allergic to its own thyroxine! It is not clear why this happens.\nIn addition, the immune system can produce antibodies that invade and attack the thyroid, disrupting\nhormone production. This destruction of the thyroid, resulting in hypothyroidism, is called myxedema. It\nis actually a disease of the immune system. It is believed that an excess of chemicals, poisonous fumes,\nmedicinal drugs, tobacco smoke, impure living, etc., disrupts the immune system and starts it on such\nrampages.\nGet away from the chemicals by moving to the country, live a clean life, eat right, use a distiller to make\nyour own water, work out-of-doors part of the time, have peace with God, and you will feel better every\nday.\nMedical treatment includes the taking of thyroxine from animals, or synthroid. This is generally 3-9\ngrains each morning. An excess will cause increase in heart rate and shaking of the extended arm.\nThe active ingredient in synthroid and other synthetic thyroid medications, is levothyroxine. It can cause\na loss of as much as 13 percent of bone mass. An estimated 19 million people in the U.S. take this drug\nfor thyroid problems or thyroid cancer.\nThyroid supplementation can cause cardiac arrest in those whose hearts are not strong enough for the\nincreased activity the thyroid dosage places upon it.\nThyroid medication can have a similar effect on the adrenals. They may be working poorly, as a result of\nyears of low thyroxine. The medication can cause adrenal insufficiency. Diabetes can be made worse by\nthe thyroid pill. Anticoagulants can be upset.\nIn newborn infants, synostosis can occur if they are given thyroid. The skull bones close prematurely\nand the brain does not develop properly.\nThyroid supplementation also increases the need for insulin and, in some, for antidepressants as they\nbecome extremely agitated.\nThyroid medication can produce arrhythmia, angina, and tachycardia, or hair loss.\nAfter menopause, a smaller dose of thyroid medication is often needed by women.\nThe human body needs less thyroid as it gets older, so older folk should try reducing their dose of\nsynthroid. To do this, try reducing the amount you take by one dose a week (example: 5 doses a week,\nthen 4 doses the next week, etc.). When you encounter problems, stay with that amount for 4 weeks to\nsee if the thyroid will adjust itself to this new amount. After a month, try reducing the dosage again, but\nstaying one month at each reduced level.",

In women, there may also be less frequent menstruation and decreased flow.\nCAUSES—Hypothyroidism is caused by an underactive thyroid, and results in a slow metabolism and\nall it brings with it. Hyperthyroidism is the opposite: The thyroid is overactive; metabolism is too fast,\nand that brings its own problems. The thyroid gland is producing too much thyroxine.\nSometimes called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is not a simple problem to deal with. Graves' disease\nis the most common form of it, which 2.5 million Americans have.\nA detailed discussion of the thyroid is found in our article on Hypothyroidism (which see), which is far\nmore common. Both affect women more often than men. When the thyroid does not work properly, a\nvariety of different physical problems can develop.\nIn fact, the word, \"hypochondriac,\" was coined many years ago, to describe these strange people who\nhave all kinds of things wrong with them, when they do not seem to have anything wrong with them.\nSurely, it must all be in their heads! Well, it was in their throats. We now know those people had under\nor overactive thyroids.\nInfection of the thyroid or certain prescription drugs can temporarily produce hyperthyroidism.",

Some have almost no symptoms at all.\nCAUSES—Menopause is the cessation of ovarian function, the stopping of the menstrual cycle, and the\nend of reproductive years. This is caused by glandular changes, and is a natural event in a woman's life;\nthis usually occurs between 42 and 55. The average age is about 50, and the transition is generally up to\n5 years.\nThere tends to be a hormone starvation at that time, since menopause usually results from a decreased\nproduction of the female sex hormones.\nThe lessened supply of estrogen increases the possibility of cardiovascular disease, vaginal atrophy, and\nosteoporosis.\nIt is popular to take estrogen supplements, to prevent or postpone menopausal symptoms. But keep in\nmind that there is an increased risk of cancer when this is done.\nIf estrogen (hormone replacement) therapy is begun, take vitamin E several hours earlier or later, not at\nthe same time.\nIn addition, generous amounts of vitamins B , C, folic acid, pantothenic acid, PABA, and B will make\n6 12\nthe estrogen therapy more effective.\nOral estrogens should not be accompanied by progesterone because they increase the cancer induction\nrisk.\nKeep in mind that synthetic, not natural, estrogens are given in hormone replacement therapy. These\ntend to accumulate in the body, and also can cause metabolic changes in the liver. This can lead to high\nblood pressure, fluid retention, and blood clots. But natural estrogens are available; one is equine\nestrogen, and is extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. But it is very powerful, and may also cause\nchanges in the liver. Do not use it if you are obese, smoke, or have high blood pressure, high cholesterol,\nor varicose veins.\nThe safest natural estrogens are estropipate (Ogen) and estradiol (Estrace, Emcyt, and Estraderm); these\nare all metabolized more easily by your body. Be sure and use the smallest possible dose, and take it\nonly every other day.\nIt is coming to be recognized that it is often more important to replace the lessened progesterone than the\nlessened estrogen. Natural progesterone creams (from the herb, wild yam) provide a simplified way to\ndo this. Many, many, have been helped by doing this!\nWhen the menopause proceeds normally, the adrenals and liver increase their output of female hormones\nand make up the difference from the lost ovarian function.\nProper diet, nutritional supplements, exercise, and adequate rest can minimize the effects of menopause.\nTREATMENT—Vitamin E (up to 1,200 IU daily) is especially important at this time.\n• Vitamin C, working with bioflavonoids, maintains capillary strength.\n• The B complex vitamins, especially pantothenic acid and PABA, relieve nervous\nirritability.\n• It is very important that sufficient calcium be taken, to maintain a proper calcium-\nphosphorous balance. Not doing so can also result in a broken hip later.\n• An increase in protein and reduction in carbohydrates is recommended at this time.\n• Maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D, iron, and magnesium.\n• Eliminate all processed, refined, and junk foods. This includes white sugar and white-\nflour products.\n• Raw fruit and vegetable juices, brewer's yeast, lecithin, kelp, and cold-pressed vegetable\noils are needed. The diet should be at least 50% raw food.\n• Avoid animal products and dairy products.\n• Do not use alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, sugar, and hot soups and drinks. They make\nthe emotional swings worse and the blood more acidic. This causes the bones to release\nextra calcium, to balance blood pH and weaken the bones if extra calcium is not taken.\n• Substitute garlic and onion powder for salt. Consuming salt increases urinary excretion\nof calcium.\n• Drink 2 quarts of water each day, to help prevent drying of skin and mucous membranes.\n• After menopause begins, you will not have as much calcium in your body, due to the\nlessened estrogen; it is important that you henceforth supplement with calcium. Of the\n250,000 hip fractures that occur in the U.S. every year, 80% are due to osteoporosis.\n• Avoid mental and emotional stress and worry. Be happy with the blessings you have,\nand thank God for them.\n• Get plenty of outdoor exercise and sufficient rest. Lay down and rest a little before lunch\nand supper. A lack of exercise weakens bone density.\n• Especially important are vitamins E, C, A, and B complex, including PABA and\npantothenic acid.\n• Hypothyroidism is common during menopause, and is responsible for a number of the\nsymptoms. Be sure and take additional amounts of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp.\n• Helpful herbs include lady's mangle, motherwort, and St. John's wort.\n—Also see \"Menstrual Disorders\" for related information.",

Peel a clove of garlic and wrap it in\na piece of sterile gauze. Lubricate the suppository with pure organic vegetable oil and\ninsert it in the vagina, yet keep a piece protruding outside. Continue doing this for 3 days,\nchanging suppositories every 3 hours.\n• Adequate rest, a healthful diet, and meticulous personal hygiene with frequent bathing\nare important.\n• Take vitamins A and B complex.\n• Avoid panty hose, girdles, or synthetic pants or panties. Tight-fitting clothing increases\nmoisture retention. Wear cotton clothing.\n• Avoid chemical deodorant sprays, tampons, and colored toilet paper. Do not use\ncommercial sexual lubricants.\n• Beware of tub baths! Take showers instead.\n• Do not wash socks and stockings with underwear, lest foot infections be transferred to\nthe pelvic organs.\n• Cotton underwear can be microwaved to destroy yeast.

There are four types:\n1 - Yeast vaginitis, also called monilial, or thrush. The yeast infection causing it is candida albicans. It is\nmore common in pregnant women, diabetics, and those on antibiotics, oral contraceptives, or long-term\nsteroid therapy. Changes in the vaginal pH (caused by tap water, tub baths, certain additives to bath\nwater, and some commercial douches) permit the yeast to grow in the vagina. The discharge is moderate\nin amount, but thick yellowish or white and curd-like. It may cause severe itching of the external\ngenitalia (see \"Candida\").\n2 - Trichomonas, caused by trichomonas vaginalis. This is a protozoan which likes an alkaline\nenvironment. It may be sexually transmitted (so both should be treated at the same time). In the man,\nthere are no symptoms; in the woman, there is a greenish white or heavy yellow, frothy, discharge which\nmay have a slight odor. The discharge causes itching, burning, and reddening of the skin. If it spreads to\nthe urethra, there may be frequent burning urination. Flagyl, which is a medication for this, is known to\ncause cancer in animals.\n3 - Non-specific vaginitis is caused by organisms other than yeast or trichomonas, and occurs when\nresistance is low and the normal vaginal flora changes.\n4 - Atrophic vaginitis occurs in post-menopausal women and those whose ovaries have been surgically\nremoved. Adhesions form and there is a high susceptibility to infection. Symptoms include itching or\nburning, painful intercourse, and a thin watery discharge, sometimes tinged with blood.\nVaginitis may have one or more of the following causes: bacterial or fungal infection, intestinal worms,\nvitamin B deficiency, congestion of the pelvic organs, gonococci, chemical irritation (strong douches),\nmechanical irritation (tampons), drug medications, and deodorant sprays.\nOther contributing factors include tight and nonporous clothing, diabetes, and the use of antibiotics.\nThe birth control pill causes a B deficiency and changes the vaginal pH.\n6\nPregnancy increases the vaginal pH, and also its glycogen content. This is favorable to yeast infection.\nBut it generally leaves\nTight-fitting synthetic underwear provides poor ventilation and a warm, moist, environment for yeast\ninfection to occur.\nExcess sugar and refined carbohydrates help feed yeast infection.\nNormally, the pH of the vagina is acid; anything that alkalinizes it contributes to vaginitis. Causes\ninclude diabetes, menstrual period, pregnancy, and the time just after a miscarriage or abortion.\nThe most common aftereffect of antibiotic therapy in women is a vaginal yeast infection.\nFrequent douching upsets vaginal pH and flora.\nExcessive sex or intercourse, without proper lubrication, irritates vaginal walls.\nAbout 5% of women given tetracycline for acne develop vaginitis.\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) produce a favorable environment for yeast infection, since they reduce\nnormal vaginal secretions.\nFour primary factors are antibiotics, oral contraceptives, diabetes, and pregnancy.",

Infective causes include candida (candida albicans, also called\nyeast infection or monilia), trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia, hemophilus vaginitis, streptococcus, or\nneisseria gonorrhea. It can also be caused by staphylococcus; this is the bacteria which will cause toxic\nshock syndrome when vaginal tampons are used incorrectly. Culture growth of bacteria and examination\nof discharge under microscope is needed for specific diagnosis.\nOther causes include a vitamin B complex deficiency, excessive douching, the use of antibiotics or oral\ncontraceptives, or intestinal worms.\nLeukorrhea frequently occurs where there is diabetes or pregnancy.",

This will reduce the amount of estrogen deprivation, especially if you\nstill have your ovaries.\n• If you do use hormonal replacement, take the lowest dosage possible. Ask for a\ncombined hormone containing both estrogen and progesterone. That will help reduce the\nrisk of cancer. Progesterone, not estrogen, is the hormone most needed in replacement\ntherapy.\nSYMPTOMS—Depression, urinary tract problems, joint pain, headaches, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue,\nloss of bone mass, and increased likelihood of heart disease.\nCAUSES—A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, and is done to remove fibroids (30%\nof the time), endometriosis (20%), or uterine prolapse (18%).\nThere are three types of hysterectomies, each more complete than the preceding one:\n1 - Partial hysterectomy: The uterus is removed, but the cervix and other female reproductive organs\nremain.\n2 - Total hysterectomy: Both the uterus and cervix are removed.\n3 - Panhysterectomy: The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are removed.\nThere are problems which led to the decision to have a hysterectomy. These may include urinary tract\nproblems, lengthy and heavy periods, a heavy and bloated feeling, abdominal swelling due to fibroids,\ninfertility resulting from fibroids or endometriosis, or reactions to drugs given for endometriosis.\nBut the problems resulting from a hysterectomy are, if anything, more significant:\nThe hormones are suddenly stopped. This sends shock waves throughout the entire system.\nLack of those hormones can result in immense bone mass loss, osteoporosis, and greater likelihood of\nheart disease, depression, urinary tract problems, dizziness, insomnia, headaches, and general fatigue.\nEven those women who do not have their ovaries cut out still experience a drastic lessening of estrogen\noutput. In addition, menopause begins years earlier for half the women who are spared their ovaries.\nDepression may also occur, and reduced sexual desire frequently does. There is a 50% chance of a minor\npost-operative complication, such as fever, bleeding, or wound healing. One in a 1,000 die and 10%\nrequire a blood transfusion.\nIt has been estimated that many of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in America each year are\ntotally unnecessary. No foreign country has even half that per capita amount.\nOnce the operation has been performed, you are permanently sterile, and it cannot be reversed.\nIt is often recommended that the ovaries be taken out also, because they might later become cancerous.\nYet statistics reveal that ovarian cancer is rare.\nIt is frequently recommended that a hysterectomy be performed, to eliminate fibroids, since they might\nbe malignant. But modern technology permits them to be examined, by ultrasound, for abnormalities. A\nmyomectomy should be performed to remove problematic fibroids, not a hysterectomy. (Also see\n\"Fibroids.\")\nWomen who have hysterectomies have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.\nIf you decide to have a hysterectomy, ask that a horizontal incision be made, not a vertical one.

This can\nresult in acidosis, malnutrition, dehydration, and significant weight loss.\nPossible causes of this abnormal condition include drug toxicity, vitamin deficiency (especially of B ),\n6\npancreatitis, bile duct disease, inflammatory bowel disorders.\nIt can also be caused by the production of high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, which is a\nhormone. Cysts in the uterus or multiple pregnancy can be the cause.\nMorning sickness generally does not continue beyond the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. If there is\npersistent vomiting or nausea later, consult with your health-care provider.\nAt its worst, morning sickness can degenerate into hyperemesis gravidarum. In this situation, the mother-\nto-be has far too much vomiting and nausea; is overly dehydrated; not urinating properly; and cannot\nkeep food, water, and juice down for over a period of 4-6 hours.\nThis condition can lead to pulse irregularities, electrolyte imbalance, and even kidney and liver damage.\nKetones produced, when stored fat is broken down, can damage neurological development in the fetus.\nHow to avoid this danger?

The milk gives the baby\nvaluable antibodies. If you stop nursing, the mastitis could more easily lead to an abscess\nin the breast.\n• Go to bed, drink lots of clear fluids, and nurse more frequently.\n• Alternate hot and cold compresses are often all the treatment required. Apply a hot\ncompress for 3 minutes, then cold for 30 seconds. Do this 3 times, and repeat the series 2-\n3 times each day.\n• Sometimes a continuous cold application is preferred. If so, give a hot footbath at the\nsame time.\n• Nurse the affected breast twice as often, but for shorter periods of time. Try to keep it\nemptied. Let no one tell you that you should stop nursing if you have mastitis! Keep\nnursing; you will recover more quickly and the baby will not be injured.\n• Obtain plenty of rest, including frequent rest periods throughout the day.\nPREVENTION—The article, \"Breast-feeding,\" contains many important points.\nPrevention of mastitis begins prior to childbirth. For 2-3 months, the mother-to-be must get her nipples\nready for lactation. She should massage the nipples daily with chickweed ointment. Vitamin E may also\nbe used. Perform the \"nipple pull\" several times each day during a shower.\nDuring breast-feeding, position the baby right. Place the baby on breast correctly, emptying the breast\nfully, and break suction properly. This should be followed by emptying the breast with a hand pump, if\nnecessary. Nipple cleanliness is also important. Proper clothing should be worn. All this and more is\nexplained in \"Breast-feeding.\"\n— Also see \"Fibrocystic Breast Disease.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Breast inflammation: redness, pain, fever, inflammation, chills, hard swelling, malaise,\nheadache, and possibly swollen cervical and/or axillary lymph nodes.\nCAUSES—Mastitis generally occurs between the fifth day after childbirth to the second or third\nweek—and especially occurs to mothers nursing their first baby. Usually limited to one breast, it must\nbe treated promptly or an abscess may develop. But treatment must be started within 12-18 hours after\nthe first symptoms are noted.\nThe breast and milk duct system has been invaded by staphylococci invading a fissured or cracked\nnipple.\nCauses include shallow grip on the nipple by the infant (see \"Breast-feeding\"), incomplete emptying\nduring each feeding, blocked duct, poor nipple care and hygiene, irritating clothing, engorged breast\nbecause of trying to wean the child off milk, irritating clothing, or lack of proper nipple preparation prior\nto lactation. See \"Breast Feeding\" for proper routines.\nBreast engorgement results from incomplete emptying each time.

Such defects include cleft palates, cleft lips, heart defects, limb defects, spina\nbifida, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart defects, brain defect, fetal hernia.\nAll of the above diseases have been eliminated from valuable livestock by the veterinary profession.\nThey have done this by giving the animals excellent nutrition.\nIt is well-known that bearing a child after the age of 40 can cause problems. But teenagers have a greater\npercentage of children with birth defects than do women over 40, because of their general poor eating\nhabits and lack of vitamin/mineral supplementation. Many young people today live on junk food and\nhave damaged offspring as a result.\nAs an example, let us consider cystic fibrosis; it is a type of adrenal damage). It is classified as the \"most\ncommon genetic defect\"; yet, in reality, cystic fibrosis is a selenium and fatty acid deficiency in the fetus\nand/or newborn breast-fed infant. If the mother has celiac disease, this can impede her absorption of\nessential nutrients, especially selenium, even more.\nIn 1958, Dr. Kaus Schwartz reported in the NIH publication, Federal Proceedings, that selenium was an\nessential nutrient. The deficiency symptoms he reported all fit cystic fibrosis. But no one paid attention.\nIn 1972, Cornell University found that chicks hatched from selenium deficient hens developed all the\nclassical symptoms of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. But they too did not connect the finding to\nselenium.\nBut they also discovered that, if selenium was given to the chicks within 30 days after hatching, they\nwere totally cured within 21 days.\nIn 1978, J.D. Wallach, a veterinarian researcher, identified this problem in animals and birds as being\n\"cystic fibrosis.\" But, when other researchers agreed with his findings, Wallach was fired within 24\nhours from his government research laboratory.\nSince that date, Wallach has treated over 450 CF patients with excellent results. He has cured three-\nmonth-old infants of the disorder. Wallach later did joint research with the Chinese Government in their\nhospitals, and helped thousands of their people.\nYet, in America, the people are told CF is a \"genetic defect\" and nothing can be done, except expensive\nand time-consuming rehabilitation programs.\nDr. Arthur F. Coco, inventor of the pulse test, made this statement:\n\"I am a realist. As long as the profit is in the treatment of symptoms rather than a search for causes,\nthat's where the medical profession will go for its harvest.\"\nIt is true that radiation is another cause of birth defects, yet only .1% of birth defects result from X rays,\netc. Most pregnant women realize that they should avoid them.\nWhat is the solution to the problem? It is to give women a good nourishing diet. But it must begin a\ncouple years before conception!\nPrevention of birth defects requires more than \"prenatal\" vitamins after the second month of pregnancy,\nwhen the physician gives his pronouncement, \"You are pregnant.\" By that time, the embryo has formed\nall organs and tissues—for better or worse! Proper supplementation of vitamins and minerals, nourishing\nfood, and avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, drugs, and junk food must have had its effect on the\nmother's body—before conception took place!\nDo a home pregnancy test as soon as you suspicion the possibility, and immediately begin eating\nnourishing food and taking supplements.\n—A sample of such a birth defect is \"Cerebral Palsy.\" Also see \"Cystic Fibrosis.\"",

A catnip tea enema will\nalso help. Crying spells occur at regular intervals; so, if a very warm bath is given an hour\nbefore an expected attack, it may be prevented. Have catnip tea on hand to use in an\nemergency.\n• In addition, a hot footbath or hot fomentation over the abdomen will relieve the baby.\n• If the baby is totally breast-fed, the cause is in the mother's diet. Any food the mother\nmay eat may, through her milk, causes the baby to suffer infant colic; onions, cabbage,\ngarlic, wheat, yeast, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are common offenders. Another major\ncause is fried food, junk food, refined food, and all types of confused food combinations.\nBoth the mother and the child need a good diet.\n• Colic in a formula-fed infant points to the food given to the child. It may be the milk,\nwheat, soy, or sugar in the formula. If possible, substitute vitamin-enriched goat's milk.\nAlso try to have the mother begin breast-feeding the baby. Even if she did not begin doing\nit after delivery, she can, with some effort, get the flow started later. This is done by\nfrequent attempts to feed the baby over several months.\n• If the infant is bottle-fed, for added nourishment at this time you might pour boiling\nwater over wheat flakes, to dissolve them; put them through a sieve; and add soybean\nmilk, to bring it to a desired consistency. Potassium broth and oatmeal gruel are also\nhelpful.\n• If colic develops after weaning has begun, the new food is the problem. The infant must\nbe given proper foods and only one new food should be added at a time, so the infant can\nbe carefully monitored for colic, rashes, or other reactions.\n• Wheat and dairy products are especially suspect. When in doubt, eliminate them first.\nWheat and other grains are often introduced far too early. But this can cause the child to\nlater develop celiac disease, which will affect him throughout life (see \"Celiac Disease\").\nThe infant does not have the digestive enzymes to handle grains until 5-6 months. Let\ngrains be one of the last foods introduced, and do not give yeast bread until after a year\nold.\n• Give fresh, boiled, goat's milk; it is far less of a problem.\n• Keep diet diaries and do pulse testing, to ascertain offending foods (see \"Pulse Test\").\n• It may help to give pancreatic enzymes (75-200 mg three times a day) before meals\n(enzymes may be constipating), flaxseed oil (1-2 drops) after each meal, and vitamin B\n6\n(10 mg twice a day).\n—Also see \"Colic in Children.\"",

One research team found that the 3-4 hour feedings, recommended by\nmany hospitals, is incorrect; the feedings should be every 2 hours, in order to reduce\nbilirubin levels.\n• Activated charcoal is very helpful in lowering bilirubin levels.

Beginning at 4 hours of age,\ngive it every two hours, for 120 hours in normal newborns, 168 hours in premature infants\nor until bilirubin levels fall.\n• Exposure to sunlight helps reduce bilirubin levels. It can fall on the infant a little through\nthe window or he can be taken outside. Do not let direct sunlight enter his eyes, but let it\nfall on as much bare skin as possible. Of course, be careful and do not sunburn him.\nSYMPTOMS—A yellowing of the skin is seen in the infant, appearing first in the upper body and\nprogressing downward toward the toes. In the full-term normal baby, it is first seen about the third day;\nand, by the fifth day, it is disappearing. In a pre-term infant, jaundice may appear later, but last longer.\nCAUSES—Jaundice is probably the most common disorder in newborn babies. Old blood is broken\ndown, by the liver, into bilirubin, a yellowish pigment. But when too much is made, the excess is\ndumped into the bloodstream and is deposited in tissues for temporary storage. About a fifth of infants\nhave this, to one extent or another.\n\"Breast milk jaundice\" occurs in about 3% of infants. Peak levels of bilirubin do not occur until the tenth\nor fifteenth day, and may not return to normal for 12 weeks.

If the infant is breast-fed, the\nmother's diet should be excellent; if the baby is bottle-fed, then, if possible, fresh boiled\ngoat's milk should be used. Mothers should nurse their babies, if at all possible.\n• Locate allergenic foods and eliminate them.\n• The mother should avoid chemicals, drugs, and junk food during and after pregnancy.\nEven aspirin is not good (it interferes with blood clotting, and could damage the fetus).\n• Do not use caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco; they harm the unborn child, so it does not\ndevelop properly.\n(SIDS)\nSYMPTOMS—The infant suddenly dies.\nCAUSES—There is no advance warning or symptom. That is what it is called \"sudden infant death\nsyndrome.\" The central nervous system is affected, which in turn suppresses the involuntary act of\nbreathing.\nEach year, in the United States, there are 10,000 deaths from this problem. SIDS primarily occurs in the\nwinter, primarily to underweight babies from poor families, and the mothers are generally under 20.\nSeveral possible causes have been traced:\nThere may be high blood levels of the toxic mineral, lead. It has been reported that there are high levels\nof lead in infants who die of SIDS.\nSuffocation may be the cause. It has been found that infants who were laid on their stomachs, to go to\nsleep, are much more likely to suddenly die than infants who are laid on their backs.\nBreast-fed babies are less susceptible to SIDS. In addition, they have less allergies, respiratory diseases,\nhypoglycemia, obesity, and gastroenteritis.\nIt is now known that SIDS can be caused by the pertussis vaccine, which is given to infants at 2, 4, and 6\nmonths of age.",

This can be sunlight, or a\nsunlamp. Never place a sunlamp closer than 18 inches from the skin.\n• Apply apple cider vinegar to the area several times a day.\n• Equally useful is castor oil, goldenseal tea, and borax. Rub the area with borax and with\ncastor oil.\n• A 3-day citrus fast is very helpful, cleansing the bowels daily. Follow this with a\nnutritious diet.\n• Eat plenty of garlic. Put raw garlic over the ringworm and cover. You can also use black\nwalnut extract. Wash the area with garlic juice or wormwood.\n• Place freshly cut garlic 3 times a day on the area. This is a very good remedy. Blend the\ngarlic with a little water and apply as a soak, compress, or poultice. But this remedy is too\npowerful to apply to raw flesh between the toes; it can burn lower layers of skin.\n• Take 2 chaparral or wormwood capsules daily.\n• The scalp can be shampooed with tar soap and borax. Moisten the area every morning\nand evening with goldenseal (1 teaspoon) and myrrh (½ teaspoon), which has been\nsteeped in a pint of boiling water.\n• An herb tea can also be taken internally: goldenseal or plantain, twice a day.\n• Make a salve from equal parts of burdock root, chaparral, wormwood, and chickweed;\napply to the area. Some of it can also be made into a tea to drink in order to fight the\nfungus internally.\n• Keep the skin clean and dry. Ringworm likes damp skin. Take frequent baths, but dry\nthoroughly each time. Rub briskly with a towel, to remove the outer dead layers of skin\nthat the ringworm initially attacks.\n• Do not scratch. Keep fingernails cut short, to lessen accidental scratching and spreading\nof the infection.\n• To remove crusts, soak the area in a saline solution. An alternate method is to apply\nmoist cloths for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day.\n• To treat nails: Pare and scrape the infected area, and try to remove as much of the loose\nmaterial beneath the nails. Apply vinegar with a Q-tip twice a day. Keep at it, even though\nit may require months to eliminate. Fungus of the nails is the slowest to conquer.\n—Also see \"Athlete's Foot,\" which is a type of ringworm fungus.\nSYMPTOMS—Small, flat, red, slightly elevated ring or oval-shaped sores, which may be crusted, dry,\nscaly, or moist. The centers of the sores heal as the sores spread outward. The result is an infected ring.\nItching, burning, or pain may be present. The lesions appear to be circular. The area is often covered\nwith small blisters.\nWhen the scalp is affected, the hair falls out in circular patches. The fingers can also be affected.\nCAUSES—Ringworm is a very contagious disease, caused by a parasitic fungus. It can infect children\nor adults, and is caused by unsanitary conditions. Keep the hands clean! Pet the dog and then rub your\nface, and you may regret it.\nRingworm of the beard (face) is more persistent than ringworm of the scalp. Ringworm of the body is\nthe easiest to eliminate.\nDogs, cats, rabbits, children, and contaminated clothing are generally the carriers of the disease.\nThere are several different types of ringworm, all of which are of fungal origin:\nRingworm of the scalp - This can be on the scalp, face, and on the nails, is the most noticeable kind. It is\nhighly contagious, and often found on school-children. It frequently induces baldness, which may\nbecome permanent if hair shafts are destroyed by the fungus.\nRingworm of the trunk - This includes “jockey itch,” and is spread by contact with people or their\nclothing. Dogs and cats can also spread it.\nRingworm of the nails - This consists of a fungus growing under the nails. It produces thickened,\nmisshapen, brittle, discolored, chalky, pitted, or grooved nails. The nails can either be on the hands or\nthe feet. This type of ringworm is quite difficult to eliminate.\nRingworm of the feet - This is also known as athlete's foot (see \"Athlete's Foot\").",

And, of course, do not scratch.\n• To avoid scratching the pocks, keep the child's nails short, to minimize spreading of the\ninfection. Have the child wear mittens or gloves, to avoid scratching—especially at night.\nInstead of scratching, apply pressure to the area. Bathe him often.\n• Relieve itching with calamine lotion, moist baking soda, or starch baths. Vitamin E oil\ncan be applied directly to each papule.\n• A deep, warm, 15-minute bath at the onset of the disease will help the pox develop more\nrapidly. Keep the head cool. Do not let him become chilled.\n• Each day, give a tepid bath, followed by a change of clothes and linens. Protect against\nchilling while bathing and other times. Chickenpox pneumonia can develop!\n• Oatmeal baths are soothing, because they are alkaline.

They may not have had chickenpox before.\n• Do not send the child back to school until all lesions have finished being crusted.\n• Antibiotics and corticosteroids do not help in any way, and should not be given.\n• Do not give aspirin! About 10% of Reye's syndrome (which see) cases occur after\nchickenpox, as a result of aspirin dosages. Reye's can cause irreversible coma or death.\n(Varicella Zoster, Pox)\nSYMPTOMS—Small, round pimples on the face and body, filled with fluid and appearing like water\nblisters. As the fluid leaks, it forms a crust.\nCAUSES—Chickenpox is a viral disease, which first manifests itself as a fever and headache, 7-21 days\nafter exposure. The eruptions continue in cycles from 3-7 days, and the disease generally runs its course\nin 14 days. It is communicable 1-2 days before the rash develops, until all the blister-like lesions have\ncrusted (averaging 5-6 days).\nChickenpox mainly occurs between 2 and 8 years of age, and is much more severe if not contracted until\none is an adult. If a pregnant mother has it in the first four months of pregnancy, birth defects are\npossible in the infant. Once you have had it, you generally have lifetime immunity. This is why\nchickenpox vaccines are dangerous. It is better to get the disease as a child when it is relatively harmless\nthan to wait till adulthood to contract it.\nOddly enough, the same virus that causes chickenpox in children (varicella zoster) is the one which\ncauses shingles (which see) in adults.\nChickenpox is transmitted by contact and by airborne droplets.

A white vaginal discharge\nresembling cottage cheese. Itching, painful intercourse. In men—a clear, watery, urethral\ndischarge. But often no symptoms at all.\nGenital Herpes: Itching and burning in the genital area. Discomfort when urinating. A\nwatery vaginal or urethral discharge.

In men—a clear urethral discharge.\nSyphilis: a sore on the genitals; accompanied by rash, fever, patches of flaking tissue; sore\nthroat; and sores in the mouth or anus.\nGonorrhea: In women—a cloudy vaginal discharge, frequent and painful urination,\nvaginal itching. Inflammation of the pelvic area, rectal discharge, and abnormal uterine\nbleeding. In men—a pus-filled, yellowish, discharge. Often there are no symptoms for\nmonths. In women there may never be symptoms, yet all the while they are infecting men.\nAIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome): Aids has many symptoms; see \"AIDS.\"\nCAUSES—Venereal diseases are transmitted by intimate contact, when at least one has had more than\none partner. STDs can cause urinary tract problems, sterility in women, and prostatic inflammation in\nmen.\nAt the present time, one teenage girl in four has a STD.

Symptoms generally appear 7-14 days after sexual contact. In men, symptoms\nare generally present, including difficult and painful urination, a yellow discharge of pus, and mucous\nfrom the penis. Symptoms appear 2-14 days after contact. The discharge continues 6-8 weeks.\nCAUSES—As with syphilis (which see), the effects of gonorrhea keep getting worse. The secondary\nstage is difficult to detect and so is often misdiagnosed as arthritis. The gonorrhea is entering the bones,\njoints, tendons, and other tissues, causing mild fever, aches, inflamed joints, and sometimes skin lesions.\nIn men, the outcome can be sterility.\nAs long as 10 years later, the urethra may narrow or stricture, making urination difficult and at times\nimpossible. This produces serious inflammation of the bladder. This occurs more often in men than in\nwomen.\nWomen, who unknowingly contract gonorrhea from their husbands, generally do not know they have the\ndisease until it is far advanced. The infection can travel up the uterus, into the Fallopian tubes, and out\ninto the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis and possibly death.

This is a red, painless, raised ulcer with hard, well-\ndefined edges, and appears 10 days to 3 weeks after exposure, and lasts from a few days to several\nweeks.

These are preceded by a slightly irritating tingling. When the lesion appears, it is accompanied\nby a sharp pain.\nCAUSES—Of the 90 varieties of animal herpes, only four affect humans. Herpes is a virus that causes\nrecurrent blisters and ulcers (cold sores, also called fever blisters on the lips [Type I] and on the genitals\n[Type II]). (See \"Cold Sores\" for information on Type I.) A third type is herpes zoster, which causes\nchicken pox and, as a secondary infection, shingles. (See \"Chicken pox\" and \"Shingles.\") Type II can\nproduce blisters either on the genitals or on, or around, the mouth.\nWe will here deal only with Type II, which is also called herpes genitalis, venereal herpes, and genital\nherpes. It is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. One-sixth of all\nAmericans (about 30 million) have the disease, although about half never develop serious symptoms. A\nhalf million new cases are reported yearly, and 80% are 20 to 39 years of age. The first attack generally\noccurs about 4-8 days after initial exposure to a sexual partner. Each occurrence is quite painful and lasts\nup to three weeks; but, once a person is infected, the disease can be transmitted at any time. Symptoms\nreoccur from every few weeks to once a year or less. Scarring does not usually occur, but can. Outbreaks\nrarely occur after the age of 50.\nHerpes is a virus which enters the body thorough the skin and travels into nerve groups at the base of the\nspine. It remains with you the rest of your lifetime. But it can be dormant for years and then appear\nagain when the immune system is lowered by poor diet, stress, illness, too much sunlight, or harmful\nchemicals.\nType II reoccurs when sexual intercourse takes place, as a result of irritation to the skin. It is not a newly\ninvaded infection, but one which was received from a sexual partner at an earlier time.\nThis viral infection can range from a symptomless infection in the nerves to a major inflammation of the\nliver, accompanied by fever. In women, it can lead to cervical cancer.\nThere seems to be a link between having Type II and later developing atherosclerosis.\nAs a baby passes through an infected birth canal, it can get Type II and possibly have brain damage,\nblindness, or death as a result. If an attack occurs late in the pregnancy, the baby should be delivered by\ncesarean section. If no lesions are present, the baby is far less likely to become infected as it passes\nthrough the birth canal.",

But,\ninstead, it is an exploding epidemic.\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) invades special immune cells in the body, which are called T\nlymphocytes, and then slowly multiplies over a long period of time. As it does so, the body's immune\nsystem gradually crumbles. All this time, the disease appears to lay dormant (and only an HIV test will\nreveal that a person even has the disease). But, after three to ten years, enough of the body's defenses are\nbroken down that full-blown AIDS develops. Suddenly, very pronounced symptoms appear, which are\ncalled \"AIDS-related diseases.\" These include pneumo-cystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, found in 60% of\nthose with AIDS), Karposi's sarcoma (a rare type of skin cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; which see),\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis.\nThe less deadly AIDS-related diseases are often the first to appear. The first sign is often the tongue\ncoated with white bumps. This is oral thrush, a type of candida (candidiasis; which see). Intestinal\nparasites (which see) and herpes simplex virus (herpes type I) are two other relatively simple infections\nwhich can occur. All indicate that the body's immune system is damaged, although candida, parasites,\nherpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus, and tuberculosis can occur in those who do not have AIDS.\nMost of those who are HIV-positive eventually develop full-blown AIDS. Once that occurs, they\ngenerally live only a few years. The median survival time, after full-blown AIDS appears, is 26 months.\nResearchers are searching for an \"AIDS cure\"; but the HIV virus changes form so fast, it is unlikely a\ncure will ever be found.\nSome say the origin of AIDS is unknown, and that the earliest documented case of it appeared in 1981 in\nSan Francisco. But there may be undocumented cases of it in the 1970s.\nOthers say that there is a different origin of AIDS. Dr. Eva Snead feels that the virus was created in the\nlaboratories. She insists that, if you have been vaccinated, you have the virus.\nThen there is Dr. William Campbell Douglass, M.D., who, in his book, AIDS the End of Civilization,\nmaintains that the vaccines were made from the kidney of the green African monkeys, and that the\ndisease was purposely invented to eliminate certain people.\nThe disease is transmitted by oral, vaginal, and anal sex; common needles for IV drugs; contaminated\nhospital and dental equipment; commercially prepared blood products; and immunotoxic lubricants. In\nother words, HIV is transmitted by sex, street drug IVs, blood transfusions, and getting someone else's\nblood into your eyes or into cuts on your skin. It is not possible to contract HIV by giving blood.",

Do not touch the tick with your hands. Do not\napply kerosene, turpentine, or petroleum jelly.\n• Wash your hands and the bite area. Apply rubbing alcohol to the bite area.

Watch for\nsymptoms over the next 3 weeks.\n• Put suspicious clothing in the dryer for 30 minutes, to kill ticks by dehydration. Washing\nclothes, even in hot water and bleach, does not necessarily kill ticks.\n• Heat relieves pain. Hot baths are helpful. See \"Fevers.\"\nPREVENTION—The best solution to this problem is prevention. Avoid going out in the woods in the\nsummer months, when ticks are the most active (especially June to August). Stay on the center of the\ntrails. Check yourself and your children carefully afterward.\nWear long pants and tuck them into your socks. Wear a long-sleeved shirt with a high neck or scarf, plus\nhat or gloves. If the clothing is light-colored, you can see the ticks better.\nYou may choose to use an insect repellent containing deet (diethyl toluamide). It lasts longer than\nothers, and is said to be safe on the outside. But it is deadly if taken into your body, and dissolves\nplastics and synthetics.\nNot everyone bitten acquires the disease. A high sugar and fat diet attracts insects! The skin eliminates\ntoxins, which attract bugs when the diet is unnatural.\nWhen the blood is pure and the body clean, there is far less likelihood of tick bites and lice infestation.\nA diet high in fiber and natural food will help keep the body clean and protect against infections. Sugar\nattracts insects.\nHerbs useful in preventing infections include: echinacea, goldenseal, garlic, and burdock. Rubbing with\nlemon juice will disinfect the area. Aloe vera on the area will aid in healing.\nVitamins A and C protect against infections. B complex vitamins help keep the blood clean. Eat lots of\ngreens.\nA test is now available, but false positives occur sometimes. So, if you are being treated for Lyme\ndisease and are not getting better, consider having a second test made. One study of nearly 800 people,\ndiagnosed with Lyme disease, revealed that half of them did not have it! Physicians blame false-positive\ntests for this.\n—Also see \"Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Between 2 and 32 days after the bite, symptoms appear: fatigue, flu-like symptoms,\nstiff neck, backache, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nUltimately, enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen may occur, along with irregular heart rhythm,\narthritis, and brain damage.\nSome of these symptoms slowly pass away over 2-3 years. But sometimes symptoms recur later without\nhaving been bitten again.\nBecause this disease is now so prominent, and because it can occur so mysteriously, here are more\ndetailed symptoms on its usual 3 stages (which not everyone goes through):\n1 - Small raised bumps (and/or a rash) appear on the entire body for 1-2 days or several\nweeks and then fades. Fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.\n2 - Weeks or months later, facial paralysis may occur. Frequently, enlargement of the\nspleen and lymph glands occurs and/or severe headaches, enlargement of the heart\nmuscle, and abnormal heart rhythm.\n3 - This can develop into backache, stiff neck, joint pains in the knees, swelling and pain\nin other joints, and even degenerative muscle and joint disease.\nPhysicians especially look for these symptoms, before treating with antibiotics: a small red bump at the\nsite of the tick bite; a bull's-eye rash surrounding it; and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, chills, and\njoint pain. If treatment is postponed until more advanced symptoms develop (heart, brain, or joint\nproblems), drug medications do not work as well.\nCAUSES—The bite of a tiny tick (Ixodes dammini) is primarily carried by deer; but it is also carried, in\nthe eastern states, by white-footed field mice and, in the west, by lizards and jackrabbits. In California it\nis also transmitted by the black-legged tick, carried by wood rats.\nBoth deer ticks and black-legged ticks are very tiny: An adult is less than 1/10th of an inch, and the\nnymph is a pinhead in size. They are much smaller than a dog tick.\nLyme disease most frequently occurs where the white-tailed deer is most abundant, which is the\nnortheastern states. Eight states report 90% of the cases: Connecticut, Massachusetts, California,\nMinnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. But it has occurred in every state\nexcept Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana, and Nebraska. The disease was first identified in the mid-\n1970s in Lyme, Connecticut.\nDogs and cats can collect these special ticks out in the woods and bring them into your home.\nTick bites are generally painless and unnoticed; so the symptoms may not at first, or later, be correctly\ndiagnosed. But in advanced stages, when correct diagnosis finally occurs, the situation may have\nbecome critical.\nThe symptoms are similar to those of multiple sclerosis, gout, and Epstein-Barr virus (chronic fatigue\nsyndrome), all three of which see.\nA test now exists which can detect the bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) which causes Lyme disease.\nAntibodies are present from 3 days to 3 weeks after infection.\nThe majority of cases occur in the summer and fall. After a tick bites, it waits several hours before it\nbegins to feed on the host's blood; and, once it does, it feasts for 3-4 days. The longer the tick remains\nattached, the greater the risk of Lyme disease.\nLyme disease is treatable and almost always curable if correctly diagnosed in the early stages. But,\nbecause the bites are usually painless, the incubation period so long, and the symptoms so varied, the\nproblem may go unrecognized for weeks or months.\nIf you develop a bull's-eye type of rash anywhere on your body, see your health-care provider right\naway.",

The final stages\nare depression, exhaustion and sometimes paralysis, coma, and death.\nIf the symptoms of rabies have already begun to appear, the person will probably die.\nSee end of this article for symptoms in a rabid dog. Rabies can also be transmitted by the bite of infected\nbats, foxes, skunks, and other animals.\nCAUSES AND TREATMENT—\n• A backwoodsy nature doctor, who has treated all kinds of things with remarkable\nsuccess, says to do this: Wash the wound with water right away and then mix with half\nand half vinegar and warm water, and wash the wounds with it. When dry, apply 1-2\ndrops of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) to each wound. Do this even if, what appears to\nbe, a rabid dog only licks a previous wound on you.\n• For extra precaution, you may apply a tourniquet and a rubber vacuum cup as for a snake\nbite (which see for further details). If acid is not available, you may burn the wound with a\nmagnifying glass in the sunlight. Or use a red-hot iron. Then treat as for a regular burn\nuntil it is healed. This treatment usually prevents further worry. So says this\nbackwoodsman.\n• Jethro Kloss has a lengthy article on this in his book, Back to Eden (pp. 490-495) (see\norder sheet). He also says to put hydrochloric acid on the wound, to neutralize the rabies\npoison in the saliva. Then, after discussing a number of herbal remedies to also use, he\nquotes a scientific paper by an M. Buisson, read to the French Academy of Arts and\nSciences. M. Buisson had accidentally contracted rabies from a women suffering with it.\nBy the time he discovered he had it, the disease was advanced and he knew he was soon to\ndie. Kloss quotes a London newspaper which reported on the scientific paper:\n\"Concluding from these various symptoms that he was suffering with\nhydrophobia, he [Buisson] resolved to make an end of himself by\nsuffocating himself in a vapor [steam] bath. With this view, he raised the\nheat very, very, hot, but was delighted, no less than surprised, to find that all\nhis pains disappeared. He went out of the bath completely cured, ate a\nhearty dinner, and drank more freely than was usual with him. He adds that\nhe has treated more than fourscore persons who have been bitten by mad\ndogs in a similar manner, and they all recovered, with the exception of a\nchild seven years old, who died in a vapour bath he was\nadministering.\"—Kloss, Back to Eden, p. 493.\n• Water therapists normally work with a steam bath temperature of 115o-120o F. (See our\nWater Therapy Manual (see order sheet) for detailed information on steam baths, pp. 131-\n138.) Those with diabetes, valvular heart disease, extreme arteriosclerosis, or emaciation\nshould not use a steam bath.\nKloss also quotes a German newspaper which discussed an incident which happened in Saxony:\n• \"A Saxon forester named Gastell, at the age of 82, unwilling to take to the grave with\nhim a secret of so much importance, has made public in the Leipsic Journal the method\nwhich he used for fifty years, and he affirms he has rescued many human beings and cattle\nfrom the fearful death of hydrophobia. Wash the wound immediately with warm water\nand vinegar; let it dry, and then pour upon the wound a few drops of hydrochloric acid,\nand that will neutralize and destroy the poison of the saliva.\"—Op. cit., p. 494.\nWe included the above as a matter of historical interest. Now we return to modern physiologic and\nmedical theory on rabies:\n• Nearly all human rabies cases result from dog bites. The animal can transmit disease\nbefore it shows symptoms of rabies; but, except in rare instances, the symptoms will\nappear within 10 days if it is rabid. The disease is always fatal, unless it is halted by a\nseries of Pasteur treatments, which are started before symptoms first appear.\n• If at all possible, it is crucial to confine the animal which inflicted the bite so it can be\nobserved. The course of the disease runs so fast that the animal should show symptoms of\nrabies before they begin to appear in the person. If the animal is rabid, it will show clear\nsigns within 2 weeks, then the person bitten should begin the Pasteur series of rabies shots\n(unless circumstances are clear that the animal was not rabid).\n• If the animal got away and cannot be found, then the person should immediately take the\nrabies vaccine series.\n• If the series has already been started, and the animal is then found not to have rabies, the\nPasteur treatments can be stopped.\n• About 10%-12% of persons bitten by a known rabid animal, and not treated, will\ncontract rabies and die. If the Pasteur series is started within 2 weeks or less after the bite,\nabout one-third of 1% of those bitten will die.\n• It is not widely known that rabies is sometimes transmitted accidentally in hospitals.\nRabies in humans is sometimes misdiagnosed as a stroke. After death, some of that rabid\ntissue may be transplanted to another person.\n• If your child's pet hamster bites him, do not think the child needs to start rabies shots.\nKnow that, if you have had that hamster for 3 weeks or more and it shows no symptoms of\nrabies, the hamster does not have rabies.\n• Rabies shots last 10 days and are so difficult to take that the person often goes to the\nhospital for respiratory support while they are in progress.\nSYMPTOMS IN THE DOG—Initially, there is a marked change in its disposition. He will become\nvery friendly or very snappy; the bark becomes hoarse.\nParalysis may soon develop—first the lower jaw, then the hind legs, and gradually the rest of the body.\nBut, instead, the dog wants to run away. It may run for miles, snapping at any creature which comes near\nit.\nFinally, it becomes exhausted and paralysis sets in.\nIf a dog shows signs of rabies, it must be chained (not roped), and observed for 2 weeks.\n—Also see \"Dog or Animal Bite\" and \"Antispasmodic Tincture.\"",

(temcat edit)\n• Set aside one room which you keep air-filtered.\n—Also see \"Hay Fever.\" Important, also see \"How to Do the Pulse Test,\" immediately below. It explains\nhow to identify food allergies.\nSYMPTOMS—Digestive (after eating) symptoms: Dry mouth, food intolerance, stomach ulcers, canker\nsores, excessive tiredness, palpitations, swelled stomach, sweating, mental fuzziness, stinging tongue,\nmetallic taste, heartburn, indigestion, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, food cravings, pains,\nintestinal gas, gall bladder trouble.\nMuscular and skeletal symptoms: Arthritis; aches in neck, back, or shoulders; fatigue; spasms; joint\npain.\nRespiratory and throat symptoms: Cough, asthma, frequent colds, postnasal drip, wheezing, hay fever,\nnosebleeds, chest tightness, hoarseness, shortness of breath, dry or sore throat.\nNervous symptoms: Tachycardia (fast heart rate), palpitations, depression, anger, anxiety, confusion,\nirritability, hyperactivity, restlessness, learning and memory problems.\nSkin symptoms: Blotches, acne, flushing, hives, dark circles under eyes, itching, eczema, psoriasis.\nCAUSES—An allergy is a sensitivity to some particular substance, known as an allergen. It may be\nharmless to some while causing problems for others. The allergen may be a food, inhalant, or chemical.\nIt may be smoke, molds, pollen, perfume, formalin, etc.\nCauses vary widely: There can be urticaria (skin rash with itching) from fish or strawberries; paranoia\nfrom sugar; headaches from perfume; or asthma-like symptoms from sulfite (a preservative in sulphured\nraisins and apricots). The list goes on and on.\nMold is a special problem. It can be in the house, in the food, in the drugs (that is what the penicillin-\ntype drugs are: mold!). Avoid dampness in, or around, your home.\nIt is estimated that 35 million Americans, alone, have some type of allergy.\nUnfortunately, we live in the chemical age. The body cannot handle all the problem substances entering\nit, and it rebels.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• The most effective treatment is to avoid the irritant.\n• Vitamin C in large doses of 200 mg or more daily greatly helps many with this problem.\n• Vitamin A is essential for proper functioning of the respiratory system. The B complex\n(especially B and B ) help the body produce interferon, to protect the body against\n6 12\nallergens.\n• Calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, and zinc are also important.\n• Be sure and eat green leafy vegetables. Stay on a high-fiber diet.\n• Try eating unprocessed, raw, honey. It is rich in pollen.\n• Water helps flush out the system. Be sure you are drinking enough.\n• Because it firms up blood vessels throughout the body, exercise decreases nasal\nstuffiness.\n• A hot footbath helps relieve nasal congestion.\n• Consider these possibilities: Cold cloths wrung from ice water applied to the forehead\ngreatly help. Change as soon as they warm up. Relief comes in about 45 minutes, but\ncontinue it for 3 hours. Then intermittently for 6 hours. In some, this treatment has\nstopped attacks for the season.\n• Build up the immune system, and clean the blood and colon. Healthy sinuses have moist\nmucous membranes similar to the skin in the mouth. They are able to wash pollen and\nother irritants out of the nasal cavities and down the throat into the stomach, where they\nare neutralized.\n• Guard against chilling. It constricts blood vessels in the skin, driving blood\nelsewhere—including the nasal cavities. This causes a swelling in the sinuses, which\nmakes the symptoms worse.\n• Fenugreek helps eliminate hard mucous from the body. Garlic kills bacteria. Goldenseal\nhelps clear out toxins from the digestive tract.\n• Cover mattress and pillows with plastic. Avoid wool bedding or furniture stuffed with\nhorsehair.\n• If you have animals in the house, keep them clean, well groomed and healthy.\nFrequently change cages or wash their bedding. (temcat edit)\n—Also see \"Allergies\" and \"Asthma.\"\n(Allergic Rhinitis)\nSYMPTOMS—Itching in the nose, throat, and eyes. Runny or stuffy nose, headaches, pain in the head\nand sinuses, blurred vision, red and itchy eyes, postnasal drip. A clear, watery, discharge from the nose\nand eyes occurs. There is sneezing and nervous irritability.\nCAUSES—Hay fever is most frequently caused by breathing in plant pollens. (Ragweed and grass\npollen are the worst offenders.) The problem tends to be seasonal (spring or fall), according to plant\ncycles. But some may have to suffer with it all year long if they are sensitive to dust, feathers, or animal\ndanders. Such people are said to have perennial allergic rhinitis.\nHay fever is a reaction of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and air passages to such seasonal\npollens, as well as to dust, feathers, animal hair, and other irritants.\nDry, windy, days; riding in an open car; and working in the garden sometimes increase symptoms.\nMorning and evening hours are the most uncomfortable. Midday may be better.\nStressful situations and alcoholic beverages can trigger an attack.\nAnger, resentment, or negative thoughts can increase the symptoms.\nHay fever sufferers frequently also have asthma and dermatitis.\nThe body is trying to clean out toxins and dust. If the diet is not nutritious; if the person is eating too\nmuch or eating foods, such as milk, ice cream, sugar, and white-flour products, the overloaded system\ncannot deal properly with the additional task of resisting the effects of airborne pollens.",

    "title": "Food Poisoning",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• As soon as you believe you have food poisoning, take a eyedropperful of alcohol-free\ngoldenseal extract every 4 hours for 24 hours. This natural antibiotic will destroy bacteria\nin the intestinal tract. (But never take goldenseal for more than a week at a time, during\npregnancy, or if you are allergic to ragweed.)\n• Take 6 charcoal tablets immediately, and again in 6 hours. They will help neutralize\npoisons in your bloodstream. Drink lots of good water (distilled is best).\n• Telephone your regional Poison Control Center. There is a different phone number for\neach state. Dial the operator (0) or emergency (911) and ask for that number in your state.\n• Use enemas to clean out the colon.\n• Someone should help the one vomiting, so he does not choke. If he does not stop\nvomiting within 24 hours, collect samples for analysis, to identify the poison.\n• Sometimes it is best to induce vomiting. Lobelia will help or drinking water and putting\na finger down the throat.\n• If food poisoning may have occurred in a restaurant or roadhouse, contact the health\ndepartment.\n• If the condition continues, contact a physician.\n• Research at the University of Wolverhamptom, in Britain, disclosed that all types of\ndisease-producing intestinal bacteria died when garlic was present.\n• A severe headache and vomiting soon after a meal may be caused by food allergies,\nwhich see. Charcoal tablets will help solve that problem.\nPREVENTION—It is best to stop eating meat and dairy products or, if you do, be sure they are most\nthoroughly cooked. Check home-canned jars carefully before opening them. Beware of restaurants,\nroadhouses, and salad bars. When eating out, you eat at your own risk. To help protect you, eat 2 garlic\ntablets before you eat anything else. Better yet, pack bag lunches and learn to buy what you need at a\ngrocery store.\nRefrigerate food you buy as soon as you can. Keep perishables refrigerated. Keep food hot or cold; food\nleft at room temperature encourages bacterial growth. Keep the refrigerator set at 40o F. or below, and\nthe freezer set at 0o F. or below.\nMeat, poultry, eggs, and seafood are especially dangerous. They must be cooked thoroughly and hands\nwashed; all utensils touching the raw materials must be sterilized. Do not use recipes calling for raw\neggs which will remain raw or be inadequately cooked. Do not leave mayonnaises, salad dressings, and\nmilk products sitting out at room temperature. Be especially careful at picnics.\nWash kitchen towels and sponges daily with a 1-20 bleach and water solution.\nDo not use bulging cans or products with loose lids or cracked jars! Rusted, sticky, or bent cans should\nbe discarded. Wash lunch boxes and Thermos bottles after each use.\nThaw all frozen foods in the refrigerator.\nWhen reheating food, bring it to a quick boil, and cook it for a minimum of 4 minutes.\nDo not give honey to a young baby below the age of one. Fed by the honey, botulism spores will grow in\nthe infant's intestine, producing botulism toxin.\nSYMPTOMS—Pain, vomiting, cramping, weakness, diarrhea, dizziness.\nSymptoms occur quickly, 1-4 hours after eating the contaminated substance. They can last for a few\nhours or a few days.\nSalmonella symptoms: pain, vomiting, and diarrhea can require several days to appear.\nStaphylococcus aureus symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting 2-6 hours after the meal. It is good to\ninduce vomiting, to help rid the system of toxins.\nBotulism symptoms: 12-48 hours after ingestion, symptoms appear. Extreme weakness, double vision,\nswallowing difficulty. Paralysis and death can follow.\nGiardia symptoms: Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, flatulence, and\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—Eating food containing harmful bacteria causes food poisoning. Each year more than 2\nmillion Americans report food poisoning. Of course, the actual number is far higher. Unfortunately, we\nlive in a poisoned age. About 2 million Americans report food poisoning each year; of that number,\n9,000 people die each year. A far greater number have food poisoning, who think it is the flu.\nA full 90% of botulism cases in the United States are caused by improper home canning. The safest\nmethod is to cook the jarred food in a pressure cooker rather than in a tub on top of the stove.\nTwo-thirds of all food poisoning cases were related to the use of poorly cooked eggs.\nThe types of bacteria in food which cause disease (pathogenic) or produce toxins (toxigenic) cannot be\nseen, tasted, or smelled in the food.\nHere are the most common of these food poisoning organisms:\nSalmonella (Salmonellosis): This is the most common cause of food poisoning. It has especially\nincreased since antibiotics began being placed in animal feeds, to prevent disease in crowded,\nunsanitary, conditions and help them grow faster. (More than 50% of cattle, poultry, and swine are now\ngiven antibiotics.) But, doing this, promoted the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal\nintestines. A third of all chickens in America have salmonella.\nSalmonella is easily transmitted on hands, food supplies, knives, table tops, cracked eggs, partly raw\nfood, etc. Mechanical methods of evisceration in slaughterhouses also spread salmonella to all the other\nbirds being slaughtered. Cooks that handle raw meat or eggs, and then handle other food—especially\nraw food, such as salads—endanger many people. Vegetarians should wash their hands with soap,\nimmediately after handling raw egg shells. Cook eggs well. (Beware of mayonnaise; it contains raw\neggs.) Milk and ice cream can also be contaminated with salmonella. In 1985, 17,000 people in the\nnortheast became ill from contaminated milk.\nOutbreaks of salmonella poisoning primarily occur in the warmer months. Symptoms range from mild\nabdominal pain to severe diarrhea, and even typhoid-like fever. This disease can so weaken the immune\nsystem that the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels are damaged. Arthritis can result.\nEating raw or poorly cooked chicken, eggs, beef, and pork products is the main way salmonella is eaten.\nBut it can also be found in clams and oysters.\nOf 35 food poisoning outbreaks reported between 1985 to 1987, 24 were caused by contaminated eggs,\nor foods containing them. Boil eggs for at least 25 minutes.\nWe will briefly note some other sources of food-borne illness:\nStaphylococcus aureus: This is said to be the second-largest source of food poisoning (25%). This can\nbe transmitted by coughing and sneezing on food.\nClostridium botulinum: This is old-fashioned botulism. Many restaurants and roadhouses leave food\nsetting out at room temperature for hours. This can also be found in old mustard and other sauce jars.\nAlthough easily destroyed by cold or heat, botulism is the most deadly of all the food-borne diseases. It\nproduces toxins which block nerve impulses to the muscles.\nHeating food to 176o F. for 20 minutes or 194o F. for 10 minutes destroys the spores. Home-canned\nfood, not properly cooked, can be dangerous. Never use contents of a bulging can or a rusty can! It is\nfound in canned vegetables, meats, fish, mushrooms, and soups.\nGiardia (giardiasis): This is found in drinking water from lakes and streams. It is not destroyed by water\ntreatment, including chlorination. It can also be found in raw food which has grown in contaminated\nwater. Giardia grows best where it is cool and damp.\nFour other sources of food poisoning should be mentioned: Staphylococcus, complobacter jejuini,\ncampylobacteriosis, and clostridium perfringens.\nEach of these comes primarily from eating meat, and sometimes dairy products.\nBefore concluding, keep in mind trichinae (trichinella), which is found in pork. Also beware of mold\nfound on food; it can produce poisonous toxins. Do not eat potato sprouts; they have concentrated\nsolanine which can cause hallucinations even after recovery.",

    "title": "Poison Ivy",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• If the possibility exists that you may have touched it, wash your hands as soon as\npossible. Carefully wash downward, so the water drips down off your hands rather than up\nyour arms. Wash with soap and water; rinse in running water; wash again with soap and\nwater. Do this several times in order to get the toxic oils off your skin. Then dry and see\nwhat happens.\n• As soon as you touch the plant, try to wash the skin with water, even if no soap is\navailable. The water tends to carry off the oil. If nothing else is available, in an emergency\napply paint thinner, ammonia, or acetone to carry off the oils.\n• Yellow laundry soap is best for this purpose. You want a strong cleansing soap which\ncuts oil and carries it away. An alkaline laundry soap or detergent is the best.\n• In washing the skin, never use a washcloth; it only moves the toxic oil around.\n• Wash clothing and gear in soapy water.\n• Those slightly sensitive to the plant can simply avoid touching or scratching the pimples,\nand the itching will be only slightly noticed. If they wish, they can briefly apply\ncompresses of hot, plain, water to the area.\n• Those strongly sensitive may wish to consult a physician.\n• Keep in mind that, for most people, the treatment for urushiol is to reduce the itching\nuntil the poison eventually leaves the system, at which time the rash completely clears up.\nWhat should you put on the affected area to reduce the itching? Here are several suggestions:\n• Jewelweed always ranks at the top of every list. This is a small plant with dark green\nleaves and red berries, which may be found in your locality. If you are sure it is jewelweed\n(and if you can find it), crush the leaves and rub them lightly on the affected area. Another\nmethod is to ball up the whole plant and wipe it over the area.\n• Other herbs include bloodroot, echinacea, goldenseal, lobelia, myrrh, plantain, or\nSolomon's seal.\n• Another method is to apply a tea made of 50-50 white oak bark and lime water. Place it\non a cloth, cover the area, and reapply as often as needed.\n• Most poisons are either strongly acid or alkaline in pH. For an alkaline antidote to the\nitching, place some form of calcium powder, mixed with water to hold it in place, on the\narea. Calcium gluconate (a dietary calcium supplement) is what the author uses. It nicely\nreduces the itching. An alternate alkaline method is to blend oatmeal into a fine powder,\nand add a small amount of water to make a paste. Goldenseal, a very alkaline substance,\ncan also be used. Banana peels, rubbed directly on the area, bring relief for as long as 4\nhours. Another way is to place calamine lotion on it (but beware of the antihistamine\nadditives in some brands of it; they can produce their own allergic rash). White shoe\npolish (which contains calcium and pipe clay) has also been used, but it may contain\nadditives you do not want.\n• There is also an acid approach to the problem! Acid substances have also been used\nwith success, to reduce itching: Wash lemon juice over the area, then pat dry. Repeat as\nneeded. Vinegar can be used.\n• Wet dressings and soaks are helpful. A physiologic saline solution (2 level teaspoons of\nsalt to a quart of water) is useful.\n• Run hot water (as hot as can be tolerated) over the area. This seems to wash off some of\nthe oils. Itching may stop for several hours. Repeat when needed.\n• When you are finished working on the affected area, you might wish to wash rubbing\nalcohol over the skin exposed to that area. This washes oils off your skin. (But this would\nappear to be a poor solution, since the oiless skin ought to have a higher affinity to the\nurushiol than oiled skin.)\nLearn to identify the plant:\n• Poison ivy is a small plant which, when a bush or tree is nearby, grows as a vine up it.\nGrowing in the eastern states, it has three leaves with a notch in the two outer ones. The\ncentral leaf is at the end of the stalk.\n• Poison oak is a bush, generally small but which can grow taller than a man. Growing in\nthe western states, it has the same three leaf and notch pattern, but the leaves are curly and\nappear thicker—more like a live oak.\n• Poison sumac is also a bush, and, with its compound leaves, looks very much like other\nsumac. It does not have the three-leaf pattern. You are less likely to ever encounter poison\nsumac.\n• Avoid forest or other outdoor wood or leaf fires, if one of the three toxic plants may be\nburning.\n(Poison Oak; Poison Sumac)\nSYMPTOMS—In those only slightly sensitive to it: One or more small round bumps with a slight pus\narea showing in the center. Each one is extremely itchy. It is slightly itchy until touched by something\n(clothing, a hand, etc.), when it suddenly becomes intensely itchy. Scratching brings momentary relief,\nbut causes redness, rash, and more itching.\nIn those who are very sensitive to it: Extreme redness, rash, and large swelling of the affected area. The\nitch is continuous. Many large blisters develop. As the poison is spread over other parts of the body,\nboth fever and secondary infection may develop.\nSymptoms appear within a few hours to 7 days after contact with the plant.\nCAUSES—The three poison plants in North America (poison oak, ivy, and sumac) contain a oily,\nslightly sticky, sap in the flowers, fruit, stem, bark; and roots which, when touched, produces a contact\npapular dermatitis on the skin. The plant has the greatest amount of this sap in the spring and early\nsummer. The poison is urushiol, which has both a plant resin and a volatile oil. Even dead roots and\nstems contain urushiol.\nScratching can transmit the toxic substance to still other parts of the body.\nContact with the poison can be made, not only by touching the plant, but by touching an animal's fur,\ncontaminated clothing, shoes, etc. Smoke from burning plants can, through droplets, transmit it to the\nskin, nose, throat, or lungs. In some cases, children have eaten the leaves or grayish berries and\ndeveloped severe inflammation in the mouth.\nSensitivity to the plant varies from person to person, and even in different times in a person's life.\nLightweight fabrics do not adequately protect against poison ivy or oak.",

    "title": "Worms",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\nHere are suggestions for purging worms from the body:\n• Aloe vera, taken in any form, is especially helpful in eliminating worms.\n• The following herbs help expel worms: cascara sagrada, wormwood, echinacea,\ngoldenseal, burdock, and black walnut. Do not use wormwood during pregnancy.\n• Grapefruit tea extract helps destroy parasites. Eat black walnut extract, pumpkin seeds,\nfig juice or figs, and chaparral tea or tablets.\n• Take diatomaceous earth capsules for 3 weeks, to get rid of your worms. (Do not\nimagine you do not have some; everyone generally does.) The worm eats this, and it\ncauses them to disintegrate.\n• Clean the colon with enemas and colonics. Take 2 per week for 4 weeks.\n• A hot water enema, with 3 teaspoons of salt to a quart of water, may get rid of\npinworms.\n• Eat a diet high in fiber, primarily from raw vegetables and whole grains.\n• For a time, avoid all sugar foods, including fruits, with the exception of figs and\npineapples.\n• Eat figs and pumpkin seeds. This can be combined with black walnuts.\n• Eat garlic, onions, cabbage, and carrots. They contain natural sulphur which helps expel\nworms. As you might expect, worms do not like garlic.\n• Make sure you are obtaining enough water. Drink only pure water (distilled).\n• To eliminate pinworms: Eat 1-2 bitter melons each day for 7-10 days. It is available in\nAsian markets.\n• To eliminate tapeworms: Fast 3 days on raw pineapple. The bromelain in it destroys\nthose worms.\n• Drink one cup of wormwood tea three times daily between meals.\n• Cut up two raw onions and soak them 12 hours in 1 pint water; strain while squeezing\nout the juice. Drink a cup of this 3 times a day. Along with this, use garlic enemas.\n• Powdered tansy, balmony, bitterroot, and wormwood can be put in capsules. Take two\ncapsules 4 times a day.\n• For children, crush garlic in milk and drink it throughout the day. Use a garlic enema\nevery morning.\n• For children, make senna tea, strain it, add enough raisins to soak up the tea. Give the\nchildren a teaspoon of raisins 2-5 times a day. Use garlic enemas, and put a garlic clove up\nthe rectum before bedtime.\nHere are other precautionary measures which should be taken:\n• Eat a nourishing diet, rich in vitamins and minerals. You need all the good nourishment\nyou can get. The worms are robbing you of so much.\n• Make sure your children, if they have worms, are getting adequate nutrition.\n• Do not eat sugar and junk food.\n• Never eat watercress. It grows in streams, many of which are now polluted. Watercress,\nwhich is eaten raw as a salad, can have pinworms and tapeworms on it.\n• Do not eat raw or partly cooked fish, beef, or pork.\n• Wash vegetables thoroughly before eating them raw.\n• Wash all underclothing, bed clothes, and sheets frequently in hot water.\n• Have all family members wash their hands frequently, especially after using the toilet,\nbefore meals, and bedtime. Do not bite nails.\n• Clean rooms frequently, especially bedrooms. Put some ammonia on a cloth, to dampen\nit as a dustcloth.\n• Sterilize toilet seats. The infected person should sleep alone.\n—Also see \"Convulsions\" and \"Ringworm.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Allergies, diarrhea, constipation, gas and bloating, appetite loss, weight loss, anemia,\nnervousness, sleep disturbances, irritable bowels, anal itching, chronic fatigue, picking at the nose, dry\ncough, teeth grinding, and the appearance of worms in the toilet. Worms sometimes causes spasms or\nconvulsions.\nCAUSES—Worms live in the gastrointestinal tract or burrow from that tract into the muscles.\nThere are several types of parasitic worms which can live in human intestines, including tapeworms,\nhookworms, pinworms, whipworms, and roundworms.\nThe degree of infestation is determined, upon examination, by the type, size, and number of worms\nfound.\nWorms tend to eat your food! They irritate your intestinal lining, and reduce even more the amount of\nnutrients which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The worms also produce toxic waste which is\nharmful to your body.\nCauses include eating raw or poorly cooked meat; eating vegetation, polluted by contaminated water;\nimproper disposal of animal and human waste; and walking barefoot on soil. Scratching the anus will\ntransfer worm eggs on your fingers to anything else you touch.\nPinworms: Very tiny white worms, which cause rectal itching at night. Contracted by eating raw or\npoorly cooked vegetables which have contacted contaminated water. Scratching the anal area can also\ntransmit them on the fingers. (Also see \"Rectal Itching.\")\nTapeworms: Flat worms contracted from eating poorly cooked meat (beef, pork, and fish). The most\ncommon one (beef tapeworm) can grow to 20 feet in length in the human intestine.\nHookworms: Found in southern soil and sand, they enter by boring into the feet, but can also enter when\neating with unwashed hands.\nRoundworms: Most common in children, they bore through the intestinal wall and settle in other organs.\nBecause of the warmth of the bed, worms tend to come out of the anus. So inspect that area on children\nafter they are asleep.\nWorm infestation can lead to arthritis, colitis, fatigue, diabetes, headaches, indigestion, lupus, nausea,\nsinus trouble, back and neck pain, and cancer.",

Do not eat meat or\nprocessed foods.\n• Keep body parts clean and dry.\n• Apply crushed garlic to the affected area on the outside of the body, alternating with\nhoney.\n• Another formula for fungal infections of any kind is tea (te or tee) tree oil. Place some on\nthe affected area for 2-3 weeks and the problem may be eliminated. Tea tree oil smells\nlike eucalyptus, and also comes from Australia.\n• Fungus under the nails: This is a special problem, and quite difficult to solve. It may\ntake six months of careful work before results begin to be seen. The fungus is generally\nunder one or more toenails, and causes them to warp out of shape.\n• Potassium permanganate is the remedy used on this for decades. This is poison, yet used\nexternally, it seems to be one of the best solutions to the problem. Permanganate is a\npowerful fungus killer! And fungus under the nails demands something very special. The\npermanganate also stains the skin dark brown, so after soaking your toes or feet in the\nsolution, they will not look very pretty. Formula: Soak the feet for half an hour in a warm\n1:5,000 solution of potassium permanganate. Dry the feet thoroughly after use. This is the\nsame formula for athlete's foot, which is a similar fungal foot disease.\n• If you need to prepare this solution at home, you dissolve a slightly rounded teaspoon of\nthe crystals in 8 ounces of water. Keep it in a dark-colored glass bottle. A teaspoon of this\nsaturated solution in a pint of water makes a solution of about 1:1,500 strength; a teaspoon\nin a quart of water makes one of about 1:3,000 strength. With this information, you will be\nable to prepare about any strength you might need.\n• The above is one of the few powerful poisons mentioned in this book. Do not let a child\ndrink it!\n—See \"Ringworm,\" \"Athlete's Foot,\" and \"Candidiasis\" for much more information.\nSYMPTOMS—A peculiar tiny growth on various parts of the body. It appears to be moist red patches.\nIn the vagina, it produces a cheesy discharge.\nCAUSES—This substance is fungus, which is also called yeast or mold. It can grow under the nails,\ncausing them to become raised and misshapen (see \"Ringworm\"). It can grow on the feet and toes (see\n\"Athlete's Foot\"). It can grow in the throat, intestines, or vagina (see \"Candidiasis\").\nCauses include a depressed immune function, taking antibiotics, or having the body damp too much of\nthe time.

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Squeeze the puncture wound repeatedly to make it bleed. Keep doing this until it bleeds\nfreely. If necessary, cut the area open with a clean, sharp, razor blade. You must get air to\nthe wound and get it to bleed freely.\n• Then wash it well with soap and water; pour in hydrogen peroxide and let it fizz. Get the\nblood flowing again. Then wash the area with pure water, pat dry with a sterile cloth, and\ncover with a bandage.\n• Call a physician. If symptoms of tetanus begin appearing, call a physician at once! It is\nnot too late.\nHere is what nature healers in out-of-the-way places do, when there are no physicians available:\n• Take cramp bark tea in teaspoon doses.\n• Grind up some peach leaves and apply directly to the wound after washing it. Change\nthis raw poultice twice a day.\n• Heat some turpentine and apply to the wound; massage it over the jaw, neck, and spine\nwhen symptoms of lockjaw are suspected.\n• Use 2 cups of wood ashes per gallon of water, and soak the limb or punctured part in it.\nIf the wound is located where it cannot be soaked, apply the ash solution in a fomentation.\nDo this for an hour, and repeat if danger is suspected.\n• If lockjaw actually appears and the person shows stiffening, give 10 drops of\nantispasmodic tincture every 15 minutes until the stiffening is gone.\nThe formula for the tincture is as follows:\n• Into a large-mouth, glass, quart jar, put 1 ounce each of the following herbs (they should\nbe in ground form or you should grind them first): skullcap, skunk cabbage root or seed,\ngum myrrh, lobelia seed (or plant if seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root. Mix\nthem in the jar while dry, and add one pint of pure grain alcohol of 70 to 100 proof; 80\nproof Vodka works well. Let this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shaken well\nonce a day. Then strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all the sediment you\ncan. Keep the tincture in a tightly covered jar. Put some into a small dropper bottle. It is\ntaken internally in 8-10 drop doses.\n• In addition to the above, also give the person lobelia and cayenne. Prepare it by boiling a\nquart of water, take it off the stove, and put a teaspoon lobelia powder and a teaspoon\nground cayenne into the water. Let it stand 20 minutes and drink ¼ cup every half hour till\nrelieved.\n(Lockjaw)\nSYMPTOMS—Symptoms generally appear within 5-10 days. Possible discomfort at the site of the\nwound. Stiffness on opening and closing the mouth, and the person becomes restless and apprehensive.\nMuscle stiffness and spasms increase and spread to more muscles in the body. The face becomes\ncontorted, and the slightest noise or disturbance produces muscle spasms. Pain intensifies, high fever\nand exhaustion develops, followed by death.\nCAUSES—Tetanus is caused by the toxin (waste product) of clostridium tetani, which normally lives in\nanimal manure.\nPuncture wounds from stepping on dirty nails is the most likely immediate cause. The germ only grows\nwhere there is little or no oxygen. The spores (seeds) were on that nail and, entering the body, begin to\ngrow and multiply. But the spores must penetrate deep enough; they cannot grow if oxygen is present. It\nis the toxin that the growing tetanus produces, which paralyzes voluntary muscle tissue, including the\njaw muscle (the masseter).\nTetanus is not common; but, if contracted, it is extremely dangerous.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Call a physician. Strict bed rest while he is receiving treatment.\n• If left untreated, parrot fever can be fatal.\n(Ornithosis)\nSYMPTOMS—Weakness, fever, chills, and loss of appetite. Dry coughing changes into sputum\ncoughing.\nCAUSES—The primary cause is inhaling the contaminated dust from the feathers, cage bedding, or\nfeces of infected birds. These birds can include parrots, parakeets, lovebirds, canaries, or pigeons. Think\nespecially twice about keeping a parrot or pigeon. But there is danger with the other birds also.\nThe disease gives the appearance of an \"atypical (unusual type of) pneumonia.\" When it first starts, it is\noften misdiagnosed as the flu or confused with Legionnaires disease (which see) or Q fever (which see).\nOnly a blood test can provide a certain diagnosis, but a history of frequent exposure to birds ought to\nprovide an indication of the true nature of the problem.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Contact your nearest Poison Control Center and describe the situation to them. Have\nlabels of the product at hand. Every state and many large cities in America and Canada\nhave their own PCC phone number. There is no nationwide number. Telephone the\noperator (0) or emergency (911), and they can direct you to your nearest Poison Control\nCenter.\n• Many poisons are strong acids or strong alkalies. In such cases, the antidote will have the\nopposite pH. But the PCC will know what the antidote should be. The PCC will have even\nbetter data on the substance than will be found on the label of the product. Then contact a\nphysician.\n• If the poison is on the outside of the body, flush with plenty of water. If inside, follow\ndirections on the label if no other information is available.\n• Many poisons can be counteracted by taking an emetic to cause vomiting. (In the case of\ncertain caustic poisons, vomiting is not the best.) Put a teaspoon of salt in 2 cups of warm\nwater and drink it quickly. This will usually produce vomiting. Repeat a second or third\ntime if necessary. Tickle the throat with a finger. After vomiting has occurred, induce\nmore vomiting.\n• If the person has swallowed a caustic acid, swallow soda, chalk, lime water, milk, or\nvegetable oil first to neutralize the acid in the stomach; then induce vomiting.\n• If the person has swallowed a strong alkali, then first neutralize it with lemon or vinegar.\n• Swallow lots of powdered charcoal in water.\n• After swallowing the powdered charcoal, to help heal the stomach, drink a tea of white\noak bark, alfalfa, oregano, or sweet basil.\n• If bits of glass from a broken bottle got into the food and some was swallowed, eat lots\nof soft bread. This sticky dough will tend to wrap around the glass and may help carry it\nsafely through the intestines.\n• Cleanse the body; eat nutritious food. Include lots of fiber, including pectin in apples;\nthis helps discharge metals from the body. Have a hair analysis made. It will tell you how\nmuch you have. Whole grains are all high in fiber. A urine analysis can also identify the\nmetal excess or deficiency.\n• Vitamin A helps the body discharge poisons. Deficiency of vitamin A can cause lesions\nfrom radiation, antibiotics, and metal poisoning. The B complex vitamins protects the\nnervous system and help the liver detoxify the blood. Deficiencies of vitamin B suppress\n6\nthe immune system. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and prevents free-radical damage.\nCalcium and magnesium are natural chelating minerals. Selenium enhances the functions\nof vitamin E. Zinc is a free-radical inhibitor, and helps utilize vitamin A.\n• Herbs which help counteract metal poisoning include Burdock, alfalfa, chaparral,\ndandelion, echinacea, fennel, garlic, juniper, kelp, lobelia, and cayenne.\n• Eat eggs, onions, beans, legumes, and garlic to obtain sulfur to counteract the arsenic. It\nhelps to eliminate the arsenic. But do not take inorganic sulfur into the body! It will\nproduce boils. Only drink distilled water. Drink plenty of fruit and vegetable juices.\n—Related topics in this book include \"Food Poisoning,\" \"Chemical Poisoning,\" \"\"Aluminum,\"\n\"Arsenic,\" \"Cadmium,\" Copper,\" \"DDT,\" Fluoride,\" \"Lead,\" \"Mercury,\" \"Nickel,\" \"Radiation,\" \"Toxic\nShock,\" \"Drug Rash,\" \"Tobacco,\" and \"Toxemia.\"\nSYMPTOMS—Something was swallowed, smelled, or touched that caused the person to be poisoned.\nCAUSES—We live in the Chemical Age, and it is taking us down rapidly.

If\nsupplementary treatment is given, the crisis can be weathered easier, and with less\nlikelihood of a return to smoking.\n• In order to quit, it is best to accompany a firm decision with a cleansing program. This\nhelps speed up the elimination of stored-up nicotine and other poisons. The quicker this\nhappens, the faster the cravings cease.\n• A nutritious diet must be adhered to. Carrot juice and citrus juices are very helpful.\nVitamin C is important.\n• Take the tobacco pack or can and throw it away. In its place put a candy bar. Blood\nsugar level is a factor in the addiction. When the cravings are successful gone, throw away\nthe candies.\n• Take extra calcium and eat chamomile 3-6 times a day. Both will help relax during the\nwithdrawal period. Vitamin B complex is also important for the nerves.\n• Lobelia contains lobeline, which is similar to nicotine. It is non-addictive, but helps a\nperson quit tobacco. Here is how to use it in aversion therapy:\n• Only smoke one hour each day, at which time 15 drops of lobelia, diluted in water, are\nswallowed every half an hour and then 15 minutes before lighting the first cigarette. With\neach 15-minute period, an additional 15 drops are added to the water to drink—while the\ncigarettes are smoked. The result will be nausea, which the person will associate with the\ncigarettes. This kills the desire for the cigarettes.\n• If the lobelia method is not used, the alternative must be a definite quit all at once\napproach. See the author's book.\nHYDRO—Here are suggestions from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):\nHeating and Sweating Packs are also used for the elimination of nicotine from the body, which lessens\nthe physical craving for more tobacco (p. 64).\nThe Steam Bath is also useful in tobacco addictions (p. 131).\nEliminating the tobacco habit: Drop the drug at once. Put him to bed. Sweating procedures (such as\nRadiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath, sweating Wet Sheet Pack), twice daily; follow with short cold\napplication, as Shallow Cold Bath, Wet Sheet Rub, or Cold Douche. Alternate hot and cold Compress to\nspine 3 times a day; Hot Abdominal Pack day and night, renewing 3 times daily; copious water drinking;\nlarge Colonic daily (p. 192).\n—See the author's book, You can Quit Tobacco (see order sheet), now in his book compilation, Help for\nYour Family (see order sheet). It is full of worthwhile information.\nSYMPTOMS—A continual craving for tobacco in some form.\nIf the person smokes, there is irritation and inflammation of throat and lungs, chronic cough, chronic\nbronchitis, and premature aging of the skin. This eventually leads to lung cancer, high blood pressure,\nosteoporosis, emphysema, respiratory ailments, heart disease, stroke, and/or many other diseased\nconditions and cancers. Women will have intensified problems with menstruation and menopause, and\nmen will have greater prostate trouble. Women who smoke age twice as fast as other women. Their skin\nrapidly ages; and the result is a dull, lifeless, gray, deteriorating complexion, and wrinkles.\nIf one chews tobacco, there is irritation and inflammation of the lips, mouth, teeth, throat, and\nesophagus. This eventually leads to cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, and\nother diseases.\nCAUSES—Nicotine is remarkable for the vast number of harmful chemicals it naturally contains, and\nthose which are added to it during growth or processing of the leaves. Nicotine is also remarkable for its\naddictive qualities. It ranks with heroin, and some who have been hooked on both declare it to be worse\nto quit than heroin. Like heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, tobacco gives a sense of relaxing while making\nthe heart pump harder (12-25 beats per minute faster), causing palpitations and a generalized feeling of\nanxiety. For the smoker who takes the last puff before bedtime, the circulatory system is only normal 2\nhours out of every 24.\nEach cigarette destroys 25 mg of vitamin C; a full pack in one day eliminates more of this vitamin than\nis in the diet.\nIn America alone, tobacco causes 35% of all cancer deaths, 78% of all fatal heart attacks, 18% of deaths\nof all kinds, 85% of lung cancer, and 85% of obstructive pulmonary disease. More Americans die each\nyear from smoking than from alcohol, illegal drugs, traffic accidents, murder, or suicide. Those coffin\nnails shorten lifespan by at least 15-20 years. These are some of the blessings you get from the nicotine:\nlead, carcinogens, cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and over 5,000 other irritating\nchemicals in tobacco. Tobacco not only injures you, but it also damages those around you: your spouse,\nyour children, your unborn, and fellow workmen. Did you know that the breath of a smoker contains\nslightly more nicotine than the side smoke from his cigarette? Men and women who smoke are\nconstantly exhaling air into the room for their children to breathe.",

Suitable mental and moral influences must be brought to bear (p. 191).\n—Also see the author's book, You Can Quit Alcohol (see order sheet), now in his larger book, Help for\nYour Family (see order sheet).\nSYMPTOMS—Dependence on, and addiction to, alcoholic beverages. Depression; blackouts;\nhangovers; vehicle, and other, arrests; ulcers; emotional problems; flushing of the face; forgetfulness;\nheart palpitation; indigestion; insomnia; urinary problems; hepatitis; hypertension; divorce; hard drugs;\nand numbness in the extremities.\nCAUSES—Alcohol is absorbed directly through the walls of the stomach, without digestion. It then\ntravels in the bloodstream to every cell in the body, where it extracts water. This weakens or kills cells.\nThe effect on the liver, brain, and vital organs is especially damaging. Most alcoholics are either\nhypoglycemic or borderline diabetics.\nIn addition, alcohol produces severe nutritional deficiencies. The body thinks it is well-fed (alcohol\ncontains 70 calories per ounce), when it is being slowly starved.\nThe liver slowly breaks the alcohol down to sugar. Eventually the difficult task weakens this vital organ,\nand fatty liver degeneration begins. Scar tissue develops; the experts call it cirrhosis.\nAlcohol is deceptive: It makes a person feel happy when he is miserable, and makes him feel strong\nwhen he is weak. It ruins his liver, destroys his marriage, hurts his children, eliminates his employment,\nand makes a bum out of him. The liquor industry should be closed down.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Exposure to the sun is vital to good health. Unfortunately, the ultraviolet rays also cause\nwrinkles and 90% of all types of skin cancer. (It can cause cataracts too.) Yes, continue to\nget out in the sunlight, but try not to overdo it. Keep in mind that, in the early stages, it is\nnot difficult to remove skin cancers; but you have to have a certain amount of sunlight for\ngeneral physical health. Be especially careful between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when sunlight\nis strongest.\n• Those with a family history of skin cancer should obtain their sunlight more sparingly.\n• In the summer, wear light-colored clothing which has a tight weave. Consider using a\nsunscreen of at least 15.\n• Tanning salons are more dangerous than sunlight, because people tend to overdo them.\n• As the ozone layer is gradually destroyed over the north and south poles, those living in\nthe temperate zones throughout the world become more susceptible to skin\ncancer—without even being in the sun.\n• Every month or so check over your body carefully and look for signs of skin cancer.\nThen do something about it.\nSuggestions for eliminating the skin cancer:\n• You can go to your physician, and he will excise it with a knife or an ointment which\nwill burn it off. If you delay, surgery will cut more deeply and, as with all cancer surgery,\nthere is the very real danger that not all the cancer will be removed.\n• Or you can use natural remedies. Fortunately, with skin cancer, as long as it is treated in\nthe early stages, you can tell if it is gone!\n• Garlic is a faithful standby. Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you\nconsider might be, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If you\ncan't avoid it, the skin will redden and burn somewhat.) Russian research, from back in the\n1950s, revealed that garlic is more powerful than antibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also\ncauses moles and skin cancers to fall off.\n• Put the garlic on in the morning; take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening\nbefore bedtime. Put on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the\nprocess. Do this for about 3 days. The mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the\narea heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process at a later time.\n• If you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the\nskin (you will know, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not\nnecessary to slough off the cancer, and could be harmful.\n• The herb, chaparral, works well for skin cancer. Take it as a tea or in tablet form.\n• According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate\namount of essential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancers. It even helps\neliminate them, once they form.\n• Eat a nourishing diet; go off meat and processed, fried, and junk food. Get enough rest.\nRight living helps your body resist and throw off cancerous lesions.\n• Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance; also take vitamin A and selenium.\n• Carcelim is a cream which you can purchase, which requires 30 days to remove the\nmelanoma.\n—Read the sections on \"Cancer\" and \"Cancer Prevention\" for detailed information.\n(Melanoma)\nSYMPTOMS—Identification is especially important in dealing with skin cancer. Here are official\nwarning signs of skin cancer:\n1. An open sore that bleeds, crusts over, and will not heal properly.\n2. A reddish, irritated, spot that is usually on the chest, shoulder, arm, or leg. It may itch,\nhurt, or cause no discomfort at all.\n3. A smooth growth with an elevated border and a center indentation. As it becomes\nbigger, tiny blood vessels develop on the surface.\n4. A shiny scar-like area that may be white, yellow, or waxy with a shiny, taut,\nappearance.\n5. An enlarging, irregular, \"angry\" appearing lesion on the face, lips, or ears.\nHere is a description of one of the more common types of skin cancer: large flat, tan, or brown spots,\nwith darker black or brown areas dotted on its surface. The edges may, or may not, be clearly defined.\nThe spot may appear mottled.\nMoles should also be watched—especially those that change in size or color, are irregularly shaped,\nhave ridges around the edges, widen, bleed, itch, or seem to be continually irritated by clothing.\nHere are still more identifiers of skin cancer—the so-called \"A-B-C-D checklist\":\nAsymmetry: Both sides of the mole should be shaped similarly. If the overall shape is\nirregular, then it might be skin cancer.\nBorder: The edges of moles should be smooth, not blurred or ragged.\nColor: It should be tan, brown, and dark brown if it is normal. If it is red, white, blue, or\nblack, it is not.\nDiameter: Any mole that is larger than ¼ inch in diameter, or whose diameter seems to be\nincreasing, should be treated with suspicion.\nSpots which are dry, red, and scaly (most frequently found on the face, neck, or backs of hands) may be\nactinic (solar) keratoses. These are lesions which result from years of overexposure to the sun. They can\nbe precancerous. Later they may become hard to the touch and grayish or brown in color.\nCAUSES—Skin cancer is also called melanoma, or lentigo-maligna melanoma, and appears on body\nsurfaces which are most frequently exposed to the sunlight: the face, neck, arms, and trunk. It can also\noccur on the lips and even eyelids.\nThe best thing about skin cancer is that it is often slow in spreading and invading the deeper layers of the\nskin. As long as the cancer is only on the surface, it can easily be removed.\nThere are three types of skin cancer; the first two are the most common, and the third is the most\ndangerous. Yet all three types can be eliminated if treated early. The medical route or natural methods\ncan be used to eliminate each of these. But, either way, be sure it is gone. As long as it is treated early,\nyou can easily see if it is gone.\nBasal cell carcinoma: This is the most common type, and the slowest growing. It does not spread until it\nhas been present for a number of years. It is an ulcer-like growth which spreads very slowly. The first\nsign is a large pearly lump, generally on the face, nose, or area around the eyes. About six weeks later it\nbecomes an ulcer with a moist center and a hard border which may bleed. Scabs continually form, then\ndrop off, but with no healing of the ulcer. Another form is flat sores which slowly widen. Treatment is\nthe same as for squamous cell cancer.\nSquamous cell carcinoma: Due to damage to lower-skin surface, a lump forms on the skin. Looking like\na wart or a nonhealing ulcer, physicians cut it off, freeze it off, chemical it off, or irradiate it off. A skin\ngraft may be applied afterward.\nMelanoma: This is the most dangerous of the three, and can run in families. It often begins as what\nappears to be a mole. Most people have moles, but be especially beware of those which appear after the\nage of 40. Any mole that is unusual or that changes in size or color should be eliminated. If in doubt, see\na physician!\nA melanoma mole arises out of the deeper pigment layer of the skin. For this reason, it spreads more\nquickly. Melanomas most frequently occur on the upper back and legs. But they may also occur on\nmucous membranes or under the nails.\nA fourth type of skin cancer might be noted here. It is the rare mycosis fungoides. For years there will be\nitching skin lesions. Eventually they become firm and begin ulcerating. Later they involve the lymph\nnodes and produce cancer of the lymph (lymphoma).\nOver 600,000 Americans develop skin cancer each year, and 10,000 die of it. More than 90% of skin\ncancers can easily be eliminated, if done so early.",

An entire change in one's way of life is\nrequired.\nFor an in depth look at cancer prevention see \"Tumors, Cancer - Part 2\".\nFor much, much more information on Cancer, see the author's book, Alternate Cancer Therapies\n(see order sheet).\n\nSYMPTOMS—The most common symptoms of cancer: any sore that does not heal on the skin, mouth,\ntongue, or lips. Any irregular or unusual bleeding or discharge from any body opening. A persistent\nchange from normal in the action of the bowels or bladder. Any persistent lump or thickening in breast\nor anywhere on the body. Hoarseness or nagging cough. Difficulty in swallowing. Persistent indigestion\nor loss of appetite, especially if accompanied by loss of weight. Sudden or rapid changes in the form,\nappearance, or rate of growth of a mole or wart or if it bleeds. Fatigue.\nTo the basic eight cancer signs, listed above, we are adding three others which are important: any\ncondition which does not respond to treatment, inflammation from blood clotting (thrombophlebitis),\nand putrid intestinal gas.\nSkin cancer: A lump under the skin, moles which change color or size and have raised edges, an ulcer\nwhich does not heal, flat sores, lesions which look like moles.\nMouth or throat: Chronic ulcer of the mouth, tongue, or throat which does not heal.\nLarynx: Persistent cough and hoarse throat.\nLung: Persistent cough, bloody sputum, and chest pain.\nBreast: Lump which is hard, does not go away, and does not move; inflammation or thickening of the\nskin. (See \"Breast Cancer\" for more signs.)\nLeukemia: Whiteness of skin, weight loss, fatigue, repeated infections, easy bruising, nosebleeds.\nStomach: Indigestion and pain after eating.\nBladder and Kidney: Blood in urine and increased urination frequency. Bloody urine is generally not a\ncancer symptom, but it can be.\nOvaries: Usually there are no obvious symptoms until later stages.\nEndometrium: Bleeding between menstrual periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.\nCervical and Uterine: Bleeding between periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.\nProstate: Weak or interrupted urine flow; continuous pain in lower back, pelvis, and/or upper thighs.\nTesticles: Enlargement of a testicle, lumps, thickening of scrotum, sudden excess of fluid in scrotum,\nmild ache in lower abdomen or groin.\nColon: Blood in stools, rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea and/or constipation).\nLymphoid Tissue: Enlarged, rubbery, lymph nodes; itching; night sweats; unexplained fever and/or\nweight loss.\nCAUSES—In this article, you will find an overview of many research studies and data.\nCancer is now the second most common killer in the United States and is increasing. One in every three\npeople will die from some form of it. Over 1,400 Americans die each day with it.\nCancer cells are wild, irregular, and different from other body cells. They grow rapidly and gradually\ninvade and fill surrounding areas. They rob neighboring cells of nutrition, resulting in a gradual wasting\naway of the patient. They can migrate to new locations and multiply. Wherever they go, there are\nabnormal growths and tumors.\nCancer cells are classified by the organs they initially invade (liver, breast, colon, lung, lip, etc.). There\nare more than 100 different varieties of cancer. Each varies in its symptoms and how fast it spreads.\nThere are four main types of cancer: Carcinomas affect the skin, mucous membranes, glands, and other\norgans. Leukemias are blood cancers. Sarcomas affect muscles, connective tissue, and bones.\nLymphomas affect the lymphatic system.\nEarly detection and treatment is vital. One person dies every 3 minutes from cancer.\nDr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner, stated: \"More is known about the cause and prevention of cancer\nthan most any other disease.\"\nDr. Ronald Raven, Chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, said: \"Seventy-five percent\nof all cancer can be prevented if we utilize the facts we now possess.\"\nAt the Eighth International Cancer Congress, Dr. Kavetsky said: \"It is essential in the treatment of\ntumorous disease, not only to act on the tumor, but to endeavor to strengthen the compensatory and\ndefensive reaction . . of the entire system.\"\nWhen a cancer becomes noticed, it is already far advanced. At this stage, it is important that the one with\nit place himself under the care of a competent physician who understands and uses nutritional therapy.\nHowever, the patient needs to understand, for himself, what is required and what he must do. There are\nsituations in which a cancer victim has no one to help him, and he must carry out such a program\nentirely on His own.\nBut, whether helped by others or going it alone, unless the individual fully cooperates with right\nprinciples, he cannot be successfully helped. He must cease his violations of the natural laws, given by\nGod to mankind, and live fully in accordance with them.\nThe type of food we eat, the way we live, and environmental factors gradually build up or weaken the\nbody. If the organs of elimination cannot keep up with the amount of toxic waste we are producing, in\ndesperation the body eventually turns to the formation of tumors and cancers. Soft cancers are cells gone\nwild because of the excess waste in the system. Hard tumors are garbage cans prepared to hold the toxic\nwaste.\nCancer generally has a lengthy incubation period of years. Nourishing the body, building up the immune\nsystem, and avoiding excess and debilitating substances enables the body to resist cancer.\nBecause of intemperate living, eating, sleeping, combined with stress, the body is weakened over the\nyears. This produces a chronic autointoxication—poisons have accumulated in the body. Vital organs,\nwhose job it is to purify and eliminate wastes (such as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bowels),\nbecome less active and efficient. The system becomes poisoned. These poisons accumulate around the\nweakest organs or where the body has been injured by a bruise, fall, or blow. The accumulated poisons\nfrom years of tea, coffee, tobacco, cola, meat, liquor, fried food, etc., especially accumulate in such an\narea. Then the body either tries to build garbage cans (tumors), to hold the waste products or the cells in\nthat area go wild from the irritation; so cancer cells form and spread. It is well-known that irritation,\nsuch as always picking at a certain spot, can cause cancer.\nUnfortunately, there are also toxic substances in the air, water, and soil. This makes it the more crucial\nthat we live as carefully as we can.\nPrevention of cancer requires effort; yet many people give more attention to caring for their prize dogs\nor their new cars. The human body requires careful attention also.\nDrs. Hans Nieper and Dean Burk stated that, by the time the tumor is present, a patient's malignancy is\nalready far advanced. As noted earlier, a tumor is something of a strange parasite, which has as little as\n2% of normal blood circulation. Its cells are living on sugar fermentation instead of oxygen as normal\ncells do. It is more like a plant or fungus.\n—Additional causal factors will be noted in Cancer Prevention.\nHere are two interesting facts: (1) The U.S. Government declares that the five-year survival rate from\ntaking the officially authorized cancer remedies (chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation) has not changed\nover the past 20 years. (2) Statistics reveal that patients who do not take officially authorized therapy\nwill, as a group, survive longer than those who do.\nA problem with the cut, burn, and poison routes is their deadly nature. Chemotherapy, for example,\nproduces hair loss, extreme nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, sterility, and damage to the liver,\nkidneys, and heart. What should you do? That is your decision. On one hand, you can take the officially\nrecommended remedies at your local hospital. Or you can try natural remedies. Your choice.\nSome of the natural folk remedies are listed here. There are many others.\nHowever, you should know that the government and the medical association advises that you should\nnever treat yourself for cancer. Their counsel is that you consult a medical doctor (M.D.), and follow his\nadvice explicitly. Not to do so, they say, could result in your death.",

As many layers of clothing should be worn on the extremities as are worn on the trunk. This is\nespecially important in cancer of the breast or skin.\n• A biopsy is a thin slice of tissue, taken to examine it for possible carcinoma (cancer). But, when the\nslice is made, the cancer (if any) stored in that area, can immediately begin spreading throughout the\nbody.\n• X-ray, radium, and other forms of radiation therapy, along with chemotherapy, weaken the body\nand intensifies the toxicity and weakened conditions initially producing the cancer. The cancer generally\nreturns with 6 to 12 months in greatly strengthened form.\n• Here is a brief list of some of the significant factors leading to cancer: Chemical additives in food,\nrefined and fragmented food, use of nicotine and/or alcohol, a heavy protein diet, excessive use of\ndairy products, commercial oils and fats (especially when heated and reheated), all grease,\nhydrogenated oil (added to many foods), diethylstilbestrol, hormones, contraceptives, nitrates\n(often added to food), medicinal drugs, hard drugs, monosodium glutamate (in food and tobacco),\nrefined sugars, saccharin and other artificial sweeteners, biopsies and other forms of surgery,\npollutants (occupational and environmental), X-rays and radium exposure, cosmetics, detergents\nand soaps, water (chlorinated, fluoridated, or contaminated), and aluminum.",

Yet some famous medical dictionaries say nothing about diet in cancer treatment,\nexcept to keep the diet under 2,000 calories. The truth is there is a close relationship between the food\nwe eat and what happens in our bodies.\n• Meals, bedtime, periods of study, etc. should be according to a regular schedule. Avoid noise, smog,\ntelevision, worry, stress, and confusion. Do some reading every day. Reading in God's Word,\naccompanied by simple trustful prayer brings healing to heart, soul, and body.\n• Dr. Josef Issels' cancer clinic, in Germany, is an example of a well-rounded program. In addition to\nother things mentioned in this book, he prescribes plenty of rest, complete freedom from worries and\nmental stress, and plenty of fresh, pure air day and night. To the degree the patient is strong enough\nfor it, and as he improves, there is lots of exercise and walking.\n• Some, in a position to do so, may wish to move to a warm, unpolluted climate (any left?) where fresh\nair and sunshine is continually available. Build up the system with good food, exercise, and rest.\n• Continual overwork and exhaustion can lay the groundwork for the development of cancer.\n• City living, with its hurry, noise, confusion, and air and water pollution, can also provide the\ninferior living conditions which lead to malignant conditions.\nWORRY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS\n• Stress is also considered a significant factor. More and more research indicates that, as Dr. H.F.\nDunbar says, \"only certain types of people succumb to cancer.\"\n• Two Soviet researchers (Serov and Troskin) demonstrated that negative emotions reduce the white\nblood count in an alarming manner, hindering a major body defense against disease.\n• Researchers at the Rochester Medical Center in New York have found that people are more likely to\ncontract cancer if, more than others, they have a harder time dealing with severe emotional conflicts\nand stresses, have uncontrolled anxieties and worries, experience traumatic emotional experiences\nor losses, have strong feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, hopelessness, and desperation. It may not\nbe that such negative attitudes cause the cancer, but they keep the person from resisting and conquering\nit.\n• Maintain a strong sense of purpose. Find something to do with yourself. In one church which the\nauthor once pastored, a woman bedridden for years before her death would phone people at random and\nencourage and pray with them. Between calls, she would pray for them. She was a radiant sunbeam.\n• A strong trust in God and peace in Him is the solution. Man innately knows that he cannot solve his\nown problems; he needs God! Only in Him can we find the strength and courage to press forward. Only\nthen can we be genuinely happy amid life's problems.\n• Read God's Inspired Word—the Bible—every day, and be happy, contented, thankful, and\nhelpful to others.

Drugs are given to shock the body\ninto healing itself. A poison is introduced, and this rouses the body to a supreme effort to throw off the\npoison. The result is generally a weakening of body organs, a transfer of the site of disease to a different\nlocation, and sometimes a smothering of symptoms—till a later, more deadly, form emerges.\n• The taking of birth control pills, estrogen, and other female hormones is damaging to the body. A\nlater result can be cancer. One anticancer physician (Gerson) found that the only cancer patients he\ncould not recover were those who were taking hormones or who had damaged livers.\n• The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported (May 1972) that pregnant women who take hormones can result\nin cancer in their daughters when they enter their teens. The rate of leukemia rate is highest in affluent\nareas, where medical help can be afforded and lowest among poorer people.\n• City living is depressing. It is also unhealthful.

An entire book has been\nwritten about the physical benefits of obtaining some sunlight on your body.\n• Second, you need some sunlight in order to obtain enough vitamin D for your bones.

Here, briefly, are several\nof his points:\n• Sunlight can change cholesterol near the skin surface into free radicals, which can cause cancer. But a\ngood diet will eliminate the free radicals.\n• A high-fat diet increases the likelihood of skin cancer. This includes too much oil of any kind in the\ndiet—grease, hydrogenated oil, trans-fat, and vegetable oil.\n• Trans-fat (fat which is not polyunsaturated) stops oxygen utilization by the cell, and leads to cancer.\nLiquid vegetable oil can be up to 6% trans-fat, margarines up to 54%, and solid shortening up to 58%.\n• If you are on a low-fat diet, sunlight hitting your skin actually inhibits cancer.",

Overweight\nwomen more frequently have cancer of the uterus, and do not recover as easily from breast cancer.\n• Accumulated fatty tissue in the body affects female hormones. The more that is present, the more\nestrogen is produced and converted into a special type of endocrine substance which stimulates cells to\ndivide in the breast and reproductive system. Overweight men and women are more likely to develop\ncancer.\n• A high-fat diet dramatically increases the occurrence of colon, breast, endometrium, and ovarian\ncancer, as compared with a low-fat diet. Eating a lot of fat encourages the development of cancer in both\nmen and women. Colon cancer is more likely to occur in men.\n• Those who eat the most saturated fat are twice as likely to develop polyps.\n• Dr. Ott Warburg, made that discovery in the 1920s. He demonstrated that the metabolism of cancerous\ntissue differs radically from that of normal tissue. A regular cell is nourished by oxygen which it uses to\nbreak down nutriments; without oxygen it dies. But a cancer cell lives by using chemicals to break down\nnutriments—not oxygen—and needs little or no oxygen to exist. The tumor, being a parasite, has a\nrestricted circulation of blood, sometimes as low as 2% of normal, hence it lives on fermentation of\nsugar, like a plant or fungus, instead of oxygen. Later experiments by Warburg revealed that normal\nliving tissue will become cancerous, if deprived of oxygen. It was this research which brought Warburg\nthe Nobel Prize.\n• Since the blood provides the cells with oxygen, Warburg concluded that the condition of the\nbloodstream played an important part in the development of cancer. This is substantiated by the fact\nthat malignant tumors are frequently found near scars, at the sides of ulcers, in atrophied organs, or\nwherever the blood supply is poor.\n• Rancid oils and heavy protein diets thicken the blood, and weaken its ability to transport food and\noxygen to the cells.\n• Unlike other cells, cancer cells do not need oxygen. Rancid oils and fats are dangerous, for they\ndecrease oxygenation and weaken normal cells while strengthening cancerous ones.\n• Rancid food and oils are unsafe and can produce cancer. Even health foods which have been on the\nshelf (not refrigerated) for too long can be rancid. Try to make sure that the wheat germ, wheat germ\noil, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flaxseed oil, and whole wheat flour are fresh. Natural,\nunprocessed foods are extremely perishable. Refrigerate as soon as possible after purchasing them.\nWheat germ is a special problem; it turns rancid a week after it is made. Vitamins E, A, and F are\ntotally destroyed in rancid foods. During the process of turning rancid, very harmful chemicals, such as\nperoxides, are produced. Because they are strong chemical irritants, after being ingested they can cause\ncancer. Research on this was done in Germany by Dr. H. Anemueller, and, in the University of\nPennsylvania, by Drs. Rownee and Barrett.\n• Heated fats (animal or vegetable), when heated to a high temperature, become carcinogenic. Never\nfry food, never eat fried food. Instead add no oil to your cooking, but place measured amounts on your\nfood after it is served at the table. In this way, you will be better able to control your oil intake.\n• Oil in the coffee bean turns rancid when heated; do not drink coffee because of that and several other\nreasons.

Scientists\nat Johns Hopkins found that lab animals fed cruciferous vegetables, and then exposed to the deadly\ncarcinogen aflatoxin, had a 90 percent reduction in cancer rates.\n• Greens and the green foods have every known vitamin, except Vitamin D and, possibly, B12. In\naddition, they have high levels of beta-carotene, potassium, glutathione (an amino acid) and other crucial\nnutrients which reduce tumor growth.\n• A diet high in beta-carotene, especially beta-carotene, has been found to protect against cancer\n(International Journal of Cancer, September 1984).\n• Green powders, such as Greenlife, Barley Green, etc., are invaluable. Eat a spoonful with your food or\nin juice.\n• Emphasize raw food to the degree you are able to do so. It is best that most of the food be raw,\nespecially fruits and green leafy vegetables.\n• Phytosterols are natural chemicals in plants which reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n• Abscisic acid is a plant dormancy hormone and vitamin A analog found in plants; it has profound anti-\ncancer activity. Abscisic acid is a carotenoid factor and is especially found in green leafy vegetables.\n• While cleaning the body (such as during a fast), breakfast can consist of fresh fruit and fruit juices. Use\nlemon, orange, grape, carrot, beet, and apple juice daily. All juices should be fresh, with no sugar\nadded.\n• But in other foods, a small amount of blackstrap molasses, pure maple syrup, or honey can act as a\nnatural sweetener in place of sugar.\n• Use whole wheat or rye in place of white flour. Whole grain products, well-baked, are good. Do not\nuse sourdough bread, sugared bread, or fruit breads. They are too indigestible.\n• Raw fruit and vegetables are best; lightly cooked or steamed are second best. Salt-free frozen are\nnext. Then comes salt-free canned; but such food should only be used if the first three choices are not\navailable.\n• Raw fruit and vegetable juices are needed to clean the system and help rebuild it. Use red beet juice\n(from roots and very little if any from tops) and juice from carrots, celery, grapes, and other\ndarker vegetables and fruits, such as black cherries, black currants, etc.\n• Fruit juices are best taken in the morning and vegetable juices in the afternoon and evening.\n• Drink spring or steam-distilled water only!\n• Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer researcher, uses fresh raw cabbage and carrot juice with excellent results.\n• Some recommend four 8-ounce glasses of freshly squeezed juice daily. Max Gerson, M.D., prescribed\n13 glassfuls a day. Along with a scientific program of other remedies, that juice pattern is still followed\ntoday at the Gerson Institute in northern Mexico.\n• Never mix fruit and vegetable juices in the same meal. It is all right to mix vegetables juices\ntogether, but do not mix fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, or grape). Some (including\nthe Gerson Institute) recommend a combination of carrot and apple juice.\n• Fresh lemon juice should be squeezed on all greens, salads, or lettuce that are eaten. This enables the\ncalcium and minerals to be better absorbed by the system. Dark green vegetables are better than light-\ncolored lettuce.\n• Lecithin should be included in the diet to keep cholesterol in the blood stream emulsified (so it does\nnot harden on the walls). This will improve blood circulation to the site of the tumor. Lecithin helps\nregulate metabolism, break down fat and cholesterol, and prevent malignancies.\n• Wheat germ oil is an extremely rich source of vitamin E, and should be taken daily. Only use cold-\npressed (Viobin), and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to use it during the meal.\n• Omega-3 fatty acids may inhibit cancers, especially breast cancer (Cancer, October 1986). Flaxseed\noil is, by far, the best source!\n• According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate amount of\nessential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancer. It even helps eliminate them, once they\nform.\n• Take a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses at the end of the vegetable meal. This will provide additional\namounts of iron, calcium, and important B vitamins.\n• Never eat fruit and vegetables at the same meals. Exception: lemon juice can be squeezed over\ngreens to help you better absorb and calcium and minerals in those greens.\n• Use plenty of soaked figs, prunes and raisins.\n• Eat garlic daily. Studies done in Japan suggest that taking garlic supplements may help reduce the size\nof tumors. It has been used for medicinal purposes for 4,000 years.\n• Garlic is a faithful standby, and protects against cancer in general (Acta Unio. Intern. Contra\nCancrum, 20 no. 3, 1964). Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you consider might\nbe, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If it does, the skin will redden and\nburn somewhat.) Russian research from back in the 1950s revealed that garlic is more powerful than\nantibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also causes moles and skin cancers to fall off.\nPut the garlic on in the morning, take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening before bedtime.\nPut on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the process. Do this for about 3 days.\nThe mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the area heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process\nat a later time.\nIf you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the skin (you will\nknow, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not necessary to slough off the\ncancer, and could be harmful.\n• Be sure to incorporate dietary fiber in each regular meal.\n• Fiber in the diet helps maintain regularity and avoid colon cancer. But it also helps the colon absorb\ntoxins and carry it out of the body. This is important. Be sure to eat at least 3 tablespoons of bran at each\nregular (non-juice only) meal.\n• Try to have a vegetable, fruit, and berry garden of your own, using natural fertilizers, seaweed, etc.\nYou are what you eat. Purchase food where organically-grown food is sold.\n• We do not generally think of mushrooms as the best food, for they are in the fungus family. But it has\nbeen found that three types (Reishi, Shiitake, and Maitake mushrooms) have decided anti-cancer\nfactors. Oral extract of Maitake provided complete elimination of tumors in 40% of test animals, while\nthe remaining 60% had a 90% of their cancers eliminated. Maitake contains a polysaccharide, called\nbeta-glucan, which stimulates the immune system and even lowers blood pressure.\n• Legumes and seed foods (such as soybeans) have protease inhibitors (PI). These tend to protect the\nseeds from being digested. As such, they were thought to be a problem. But recently it has been\ndiscovered that they tend to reduce tumor growth. The National Cancer Institute that some of these\nsubstances (isoflavones and phytoestrogens) have potent anti-cancer properties. However, eating a lot of\nbeans is not something you will want to do at home! Too much protein helps feed the cancer cells.\n• Certain other foods show an ability to slow tumor growth in some way. This includes apples, apricots,\nbarley, citrus fruit, cranberries, fiber, figs, ginger, spinach, and seaweed.\n• There are a variety of digestive enzymes. Take them with a meal to improve digestion, or on an empty\nstomach if the need is to help fight cancer (first thing in the morning, an hour before breakfast; or the\nlast thing at night, at least two hours after supper.)\n• Rice bran, pressure cooked, is rich in tocotrienols. (2-3 tablespoons a day).\n• Aloe vera extract (or, better, fresh aloe vera leaves) contains the active immune stimulant ace mannan.\n• Scientists have found that the active culture of bacteria in yogurt (lactobacillus) can fortify the\nimmune system. In both humans and animals, yogurt in the diet tripled the internal production of\ninterferon, a powerful chemical compound used by the immune system against cancer cells. It also slows\nthe level of natural killer cells. Yogurt slows the growth of tumor cells in the gastro-intestinal tract,\nwhile improving the ability of the immune system to destroy active tumor cells. It also helps block the\nproduction of carcinogenic agents in the colon. Women eating yogurt were found to have less breast\ncancer. It is well-known that milk is one of the worst allergenic foods, and can carry disease germs from\nthe cows. So you would do well to obtain lactobacillus cultures from health food stores, rather than\neating yogurt.\n• Other intestinal microflora products can be used, instead of yogurt (which can be allergenic and\ncontain cow diseases). Some broad spectrum products contain lactobacillus, bifidus, streptococcus\nfaecium. Others contain only lactobacillus, which is milk- and yogurt-free.",

    "contentEn": "IMPORTANT: Throughout this study, when dosage amounts used in research are given, the amounts are\nalways for \"per day\" (mg per day, etc.) G means grams, not grains.\nIMPORTANT: According to the literature surveyed, when overdosage was possible, this was indicated.\n(See vitamins A, B6, niacin, selenium, cysteine, arginine.) Of course, vitamin D overdose can also be\ntoxic, but it is not listed here as an anti-cancer factor. For a variety of reasons, beware of taking much, if\nany, iron supplements.\nIMPORTANT: Fish oils have also been recommended in the literature as possible anti-cancer agents. But\nwe do not list them here for three reasons: Large amounts must be consumed to be beneficial. Fish oil\nhas a known history of damaging the muscle of the heart. Some forms inhibit blood clotting\nTake the supplements, which seem distasteful and hard to swallow, and put them in a fruit or other drink\nand swallow them all together. If necessary, briefly whiz the mixture in a blender.\nWhen possible, chew the tablets. Break open the capsules and pour the powder onto your food or into a\nspoon. Crack liquid capsules in your mouth, and spit out the capsule. Do not crack vitamin C in your\nmouth—the acidity can hurt your teeth. Just swallow it whole.\n• It is well-known, by biochemists, that most cancer victims have a deficiency of not only all vitamins,\nbut also hydrochloric acid, potassium, magnesium, iodine, and many trace elements.\n• Vitamins are very important. Do not trust yourself to the official standardized amounts of needed\nvitamins and minerals. The actual nutritional requirements are much higher. In addition, living in our\nchemicalized, polluted age destroys a number of vitamins and minerals.\n• For example, vitamin C is destroyed in its effort to combat auto exhaust fumes and mercury in the\nfood. Vitamin E destroys itself in the process of detoxifying cadmium (which nonsmokers breath in\nwhen they are in the same room as smokers). The list goes on and on. The world is not as safe now as it\nused to be. We can be thankful that we are aware of vitamins and minerals and how to obtain them in\nsufficient quantities.\n[Special note: The following data on vitamin A was compiled from information gleaned from sources\nwhich had not yet discovered that beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) was the more active agency in cancer\nprevention, and far more powerful than vitamin A.]\n• Vitamin A is crucial in cancer therapy, but can you get too much of this oil-soluble vitamin? High\ndoses of vitamin A (500,000 IU) can have acute reversible effects. Toxicity may start as low as 25,000\nIU in those with impaired liver function (caused by drugs, hepatitis, or protein malnutrition) Otherwise,\nit begins at several hundred thousand IU.\n• Toxicity of vitamin A can be reduced by taking vitamin E at the same time. This mitigates lipid\nperoxide effects.\n• Toxicity of beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A, as found in greens and carrot juice) has never been found.\nOne 15-year study involved immense beta-carotene intake.\n• Experiment after experiment has revealed that when vitamin A is missing, cancer can be started in\nanimals; but, when it is present in abundance, not even fast growing implanted cancers will not survive\nin test animals. Vitamin A inhibits the induction and retards the growth of both malignant and non-\nmalignant tumors. Taken over a short period, vitamin A can greatly aid in recovery of cancer. Take large\ndoses (up to 150,000 units per day or you may wish to remain with smaller doses: 50,000 units, twice a\nday). Later you can reduce this to a smaller amount.\n• Take vitamin A in emulsified form to minimize liver involvement. Alternate, taking it 2 weeks on and\n1 weeks off. Blurred vision and a soapy feeling in the mouth are signs that the body has too much A.\n(Vitamin A and D, which are oil soluble, can be taken in excessive amounts, so one must always be\ncareful. Never take large amounts of either for too long a time.)\n• In some instances, a person needs to take as much as 300,000 IU of vitamin A. When this must be\ndone, taking 3200 IU of vitamin E will help reduce the risk of vitamin A toxicity.\n• Vitamin A derivatives (retinoids) reverse bronchial metaplasia.\n• Vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene reduce the risk of cancer by radiation and chemical carcinogen\nexposure. Vitamins A,D. and E inhibit oncogenes activity.\n• Varying amounts of Vitamin A were given to different patients with bladder cancer. Those receiving\nthe smallest dosages were the most likely to have recurring cancer (i.e., the cancer return later).\n• The B-complex vitamins help prevent cirrhosis of the liver. This is important because a damaged liver\nhas a 60% greater chance of becoming malignant. Dr. Max Gerson found that to be consistently true.\nTake a B-complex supplement. Also take 3-4 tablespoons of brewer's yeast each day. Do not eat\nbaker's yeast; it contains live yeast and is not good for you.\n• Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner and director of the Max Plank Institute in Berlin, declared that\nthere is a lack of one or more of three B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid) in tissue\nwhich becomes cancerous.\n• In various countries, nearly 200 scientists have reported on the importance of niacin (vitamin B3) in\npreventing and treating cancer.\n• 2 grams of Niacin (B3) daily is recommended as an anti-cancer factor.\n• Niacin has been recommended by the NIH in amounts up to 3000-6000 mg, for lowering cholesterol.\nBut time release niacin is more suspect of causing liver damage; amounts which might do this were not\ngiven.\n• Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal with pyridoxal-5-pyrophosphate (P5P) is helpful in reducing\ndamage from radiation therapy and slowing cancer growth from polyamine synthesis of the tumor.\nEspecially good when a B6 ointment is applied to surface melanoma tumors. It helps prevent respiratory\nand cervical cancer (Nutrition and Cancer, June 1984).\n• B6-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor susceptibility and increased tumor size. In another\nexperiment, animals fortified with B6 and then injected with melanoma (skin) cancer cells, showed a\ngreater resistance to this deadly form of cancer. Studies on humans revealed similar results.\n• Less than 500 mg of vitamin B-6 in humans appears to be safe.\n• Vitamin B12 dramatically augments the tumor kill of vitamin C.\n• A combination of folate (folic acid, a B vitamin) and B12 has been found to reverse bronchial\nmetaplasia (pre-malignant lesions). Folic acid protects against cervical cancer (American Journal of\nClinical Nutrition, January 1982).\n• Pangamic acid is vitamin B15. Many scientists (Warburg, Goldblatt, etc.) believe that chronic\noxygen deficiency in cells leads to cancer cell formation. Pangamic acid increases the body's resistance\nto oxygen deficiency. Remember that cancer cells do not use oxygen and that poorly oxygenated cells\nare the most likely to become malignant.\n• Laetrile (also called amygdalin, nitrilosides, or vitamin B17) is another substance used to eliminate\ncancer. It is derived from apricot pits (seeds). Take two 500 mg tablets of laetrile 3 times a day. It is also\nfound in all fruit kernels, except those of citrus. Other food sources, which contain lesser amounts,\ninclude lima beans, lentils, mung beans, crab apples, peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, cranberries,\nsprouted seeds, and apples (chew up the seeds as well as the apple).\n• Several apricot kernels (i.e., apricots seeds or pits) should be eaten at each protein meal. Six per day\nmay be sufficient. They should be eaten with food or, better yet, with fresh, frozen, or dried apricots.\nThe slightly bitter ones contain more laetrile (also called nitriloside or amygdalin), and are better for\nyou than are the sweet ones. Do not mix the sweet and bitter varieties; there may be an interaction. If\navailable, 100 mg of oral Amygdalin may be substituted.\n• If people regularly ate the seeds when they eat apples, peaches, apricots, they would get enough\nlaetrile. Starting to do this earlier, will help prevent cancer from forming later on.\n• But when cancer is already developing, 500-590 mg of Amygdalin, in solid tablet form, should be\nswallowed at the two larger meals. They should not be taken on an empty stomach.\n• Vitamin C is a powerful aid in resisting cancer and other diseases. Swedish studies, at Karolinska and\nUmea Hospitals, revealed that vitamin C in large doses can be an effective agent in fighting cancer.\n• Vitamin C blocks the carcinogenic effects of most poisons, including nitrates. Vitamin C can be taken\nto bowel tolerance. This means you can take as much as you can, until you begin to have diarrhea. When\nthe body tissues reach saturation on C, the remainder of this water-soluble vitamin is sent into the bowel,\nwhich reacts to the acidity by somewhat runny bowels till the C is gone. Take large doses of 5,000 mg or\nmore a day. It is the most powerful antitoxin known, and can neutralize or minimize the damaging effect\nof most chemical carcinogens entering your body from the air, water, or food.\n• Cancer of the bladder can occur when the amino acid tryptophan is not properly metabolized, resulting\nin oxidation of its metabolites. Vitamin C prevents that oxidation process, and thus blocks cancer\ndevelopment. It is a preventative agent against a variety of cancers (Journal of the National Cancer\nInstitute, 73, 1984).\n• Vitamin C is such a potent cancer fighter, that it is well to here provide additional information:\nDeficiency symptoms include slow wound healing, pain in joints, immune suppression, bleeding gums,\nirritability, and increased risk of cancer. If you take too much at a time, it will cause mild diarrhea within\n30 minutes. Intake: RDA: 60 mg. Usual U.S.: 114 mg. Prophylactic: 500-2000 mg. Therapeutic: 500-\n100,000 mg.\n• Taken in larger doses, Vitamins A and C inhibit hyaluronidase, an enzyme found in cancerous\ntissues.\n• Vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants. When accompanied by the minerals, selenium and zinc, they\nhelp protect against malignancies.\n• Low serum levels of vitamin A and E were common in patients receiving, and responding poorly to,\nchemotherapy. The great danger in using chemotherapy and radiation is the damage, introduction of a\npoisonous conditions, and destruction of anti-cancer vitamins.\n• Vitamin C and beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A) have been found to be effective in reversing cervical\ndysplasia and oral leukoplakia in humans.\n• Vitamins C and K separately showed anti-tumor activity against human cancer cells in vitro, but\nbecame synergistically effective at 2% the regular dosage when used together.\n• A substance in vitamin D, known as 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol has been discovered to be an anti-\ncancer factor. But, due to toxicity of vitamin D overdose, must be used only under the care of a\nprofessional. For most of us, it is best to avoid using too much vitamin D, although some is needed.\nSunshine is the best source. (Fish oils can cause heart trouble.)\n• Vitamin E, working with C, inhibits the activity of a growth substance (catalyst) found in cancerous\ntissue. Take up to 1,000 units a day. Vitamins C and E help the body inhibit the activity of the enzyme\nhyaluronidase, found in cancerous tissue.\n• A lack of beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamin E, and B complex in lung tissue may be related to\nlung cancer.\n• Injections of vitamin E, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin (a carotenoid) and algae extract\ndramatically bolstered levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, and reversed hamster buccal pouch tumors.\n• Human prostatic cancer cells in vitro were markedly reduced when vitamin E was added. It helps\nprotect against bowel cancer (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 73, 1984).\n• Vitamin F is the essential fatty acids. Add 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed vegetable oil to each food\nmeal (not juice-only meals). Wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil are the best. Corn oil and soy oil are\nsecond best. Safflower oil is not so good. Make sure the oil is fresh and kept refrigerated when not in\nuse. Never use cottonseed oil (it can cause blindness), hydrogenated oils, lard, greases, or animal\nproducts. The oil in the nuts is good, if the nuts are fresh.\n• Vitamin K helps protect the body against certain cancer-causing substances. Take it with vitamin C to\nincrease its cancer-reducing strength.\n• Quercetin (one of the bioflavonoids which, together, are called vitamin P) increased the cell kill rate\nin cancer cells, which were exposed to hyperthermia (heat therapy) with no negative effect on normal\nhealthy cells.\n• Quercetin reduced cancers in animals exposed to two carcinogens.",

    "title": "Minerals",
    "contentEn": "• A Cancer Control Convention, meeting in Japan, reported that the trace mineral, germanium, in the\ndiet is a significant factor in preventing and eliminating cancer.\n• One cancer researcher, who studied in-depth into cancer remedies over the past 150 years, declared\nthat every effective anticancer formula (Glyoxylide, which is the Koch treatment; the Hoxsey herbs;\nHypotonic therapy; laetrile; the Gerson method; Krebiozen; and Carcalon) involves extra amounts of\npotassium. This is very important.\n• Be sure to include a significantly higher intake of potassium. Potassium deficiency is considered by\nGerson, Scott, and others as a primary contributing cause of cancer.\n• Potassium foods include almonds, apples, dried apricots, bananas, beans, beets, broccoli, carrots,\ndulse, grapes, kale, olives, pecans, rice bran, sunflower seeds, wheat bran, and germ. These foods help\nthe body resist and overcome tumors, cysts, and malignancies.\n• Center your diet around potassium foods. Here are more of them:\n• Dried apricots, asparagus, pearled barley, dried navy beans, fresh lima beans, raw beets, sprouted bread\nwith no salt, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, caraway seed, cauliflower, celery seed, small leaves\nof chard, dark raw cherries, dandelion greens, dill seed, endive, unsulphured figs (dried or raw), garlic,\nconcord or emperor grapes, grapefruit, fresh horseradish, fresh lemons, lentils, fresh limes, nectarines,\nokra, onions, oranges, fresh parsley, dried or raw peaches, Bartlett pears, dry or fresh peas, persimmons,\nraw pineapple (never canned), raw plums, dried or raw prunes, raw quinces, raisins, wild or brown rice,\nsage, rolled oats, spinach, squash (acorn, Hubbard, yellow summer), tangerines, raw tapioca, raw turnip\nleaves, and watermelon.\n• Drink potassium broths daily. Prepare them from half-inch thick potato peelings, which are then\ncooked. Draw off the water and drink it.\n• You want foods which are high in iodine and potassium, low in sodium, protein, and fat.\n• Potassium ascorbate (12-20 g) can be taken as a partial potassium supplement. This product includes\nvitamin C.\n• Potassium and magnesium are among the more crucial minerals for cancer recovery. Magnesium\nhelps to stabilize cell membranes and elevate immune activity while potassium plays a critical role in\nmembrane permeability. (Magnesium, 400-800 mg daily from aspartate, citrate, or orotate.)\n• Magnesium protects against cancer in general (Medical Hypotheses, August 1980).\n• Calcium and magnesium have a beneficial effect in helping the body resist colon cancer. Natural\niron supplements help prevent thyroid cancer. (But many iron supplements are dangerous! Take\nblackstrap molasses instead of iron pills.)\n• The New England Journal of Medicine reported that calcium may prevent precancerous cells from\nbecoming cancerous. Calcium protects against colon cancer (American Journal of Epidemiology,\nSeptember 1988).\n• Calcium supplements (2000 mg) provide a marked suppression of rectal cancer proliferation. It\ninhibits early stages of colon cancer in genetically vulnerable individuals.\n• Iodine and trace minerals are crucial. You can obtain them by each day eating some Nova Scotia\ndulse or Norwegian kelp. Both are special seaweeds which have a wide spectrum of trace minerals. Food\ngrown on the continents does not have all those trace minerals; rainwater has gradually depleted the\nsoils.\n• Iodine protects against breast cancer (Lancet, April 1976).\n• It is very important to keep the iodine level of the blood normal, so both the thyroid and body tissues\nwill have proper cell oxidation. Eat a sufficient amount of dulse, or kelp, each day. (Do not use\nCalifornia kelp.)\n• People with myxedema, or underactive thyroids, are more prone to developing cancer. So keep your\nthyroid in good condition with seaweed.\n• Japan and Iceland both have low goiter and breast cancer rates. This may be because their diets are rich\nin iodine and selenium. Breast cancer has been linked to an iodine deficiency. Japanese women have\nalmost no breast cancer. Colon cancer rates in Japan are also low.\n• Studies at the University of Zurich and in London Polytechnic revealed that brewer's or food yeast\ngives improved resistance against cancer development. Brewer's yeast is one of the best sources of\nselenium, an important anticancer mineral.\n• Selenium made the headlines, at the end of 1996, as a special trace mineral which could dramatically\nreduce cancer in the human body. It completely inhibited tumor growth in mice inoculated with tumor\ncells.\n• Selenium helps eliminate cancer in five ways: It improves detoxification, bolsters immune function,\ndirectly toxic to tumor cells, and may is a valuable anti-proliferative factor (Lancet, July 1983).\nSelenium intake should not exceed 2500 mcg (2.5 mg) per day.\n• Using selenium as a sole therapy, there was a 38.8% favorable response rate in patients with oral\ncancer.\n• High doses of selenium (equivalent to 54 mg in humans) resulted in 83-90% reduction in rate of tumor\ngrowth in mice.\n• Long-term usage of 5000 mcg of selenium may result in fingernail changes and hair loss. Selenite is\nmore toxic than selenium bound to amino acids (i.e., selenomethionine). Ingestion of 1-5 mg/kg body\nweight of selenite will produce toxic side effects. This is equivalent to 65,000 mcg in a 65 kg adult.\n• Chromium as picolinate is very helpful in working with carcinoma. (400-800 mcg.)\n• Zinc as zinc picolinate (30-100 mg) is also a significant help. It protects against prostrate cancer\n(British Journal of Urology, October 1983).\n• Cesium is neither essential nor toxic in cancer reduction. But it slightly alters the pH of cancer cells,\nrendering them more vulnerable to immune attack.",

So does vitamin E, working\nin the liver. (Cancer does not use oxygen in the cells.)\n• CoQ10 increases aerobic (oxygen) metabolism and immune function. Cancer cells thrive where there\nis a lack of oxygen.\n• CoQ10 sometimes reduces hair loss in those who choose to take chemotherapy.\n• Scientists, at UCLA, have found that sodium linoleate, which contains linoleic acid (an essential\nfatty acid) has the ability to fight cancer cells. Lecithin is a good source.\n• Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) can be taken as oil of borage, evening primrose, or black current seed.\nIn purified form, up to 1.5 grams per day can be taken.\n• Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil (1-2 tsp. daily).

And now, before the cancer has a chance to start, you are beginning\nwaste disposal operations. With prayer, diligent work, and the blessing of God, you can have success.\n• While some are concerned with treating symptoms, you must be concerned with getting at the causes\nof cancer and eliminating them. Only then can the problem be permanently solved.\nThe Gerson Therapy seems to do the best job of eliminating the toxins. You will find it discussed later in\nthis book.\n• Well, there you have a number of possible suggestions. What you have just read may seem like a lot of\nwork. But, since cancer will generally mean the end of you, are you sure you do not want to work?\n• It is extremely important that you care for and rebuild the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, bowels, and other\norgans. Dr. Max Gerson maintained that he could eliminate cancer in anyone if the liver was in good\ncondition. Take care of your liver.\n• If you have cancer, we recommend that you locate a physician and place yourself under his care.
