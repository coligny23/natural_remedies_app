Leafy, dark green vegetables and garlic are important.\n• Do not eat meat, and avoid alcohol and nicotine!\n• Make a gallon of goldenseal tea (stronger than you would drink); and, after straining out\nthe herb, put the leg in it for an hour. When finished, let it dry for 10 minutes; apply olive\noil in, and around, the ulcer. Dust a little powdered goldenseal on it. If needed to keep out\ninsects, put a light gauze bandage over it while letting the air in. It will heal, but slowly.\nAs much as two months may be required.\n—Also see \"Abscesses\" and \"Boils.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God is pleased when we keep our faces turned toward His Son, Jesus Christ,\nour only Saviour. When we are in trouble and pressed down with anxieties, the Lord is near. He bids us\ncast all our care upon Him, for He careth for us.\nSection 2\nSkin\nPart 3\nSkin Spots\n\nSYMPTOMS—Open sores which develop on poorly appearing skin areas of the legs.\nCAUSES—Leg ulcers occur when the blood circulation to the legs is inadequate. Skin tissue tends to\nerode and ulcers can form. Individuals with varicose veins, thrombophlebitis, or other conditions caused\nby poor circulation are most likely to develop this problem.",

Throughout the day give small amounts of water, fruit juices, or ice chips,\nto help restore lost fluid.\n• Do not give junk beverages (colas, black tea, coffee, or alcohol), for they will only\nirritate and intensify the symptoms.\n• When vomiting and diarrhea cease, give small amounts of non-irritating food, such as\ncooked rice, plain cooked potatoes, cooked carrots, bananas, or apple sauce.\n• Avoid processed and greasy foods; avoid milk and high-roughage foods.\n• Do not be quick to let him up from bed, for the vomiting and loss of fluids may have\nweakened him.\n• Especially in small children and infants, watch for signs of dehydration. These signs\ninclude drowsiness, rapid respiration, and dry skin and mucous membranes. This is\nimportant.\n• Mix 1 tsp. of catnip tea leaves in a cup of water, steep for 15 minutes, and drink while\nwarm. This is very soothing to the digestive system. If it is vomited up, give again\nimmediately; it is more likely to be accepted and kept down the second time.\n• If fluids cannot be kept down, then give small saline enemas, to replace lost body fluids.\nUsing 1 level tsp. of salt per pint of water, inject 1-2 oz of the solution into the rectum\n(using a small rubber bulb syringe).

    "title": "Chronic Gastritis",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• For rapid pain relief, drink a large glass of water. It dilutes the stomach acids and flushes\nthem out.\n• Avoid all situations resulting in tension, stress, irritability, nervous strain, anger, or fear.\nComplete rest and relaxation from pressing problems and worries is needed.\n• Do not eat fried foods, tea, caffeine products, salt, chocolate, animal fats, strong spices\nor soft drinks. Do not drink cow's milk. Do not smoke (if you do, do not expect the ulcer\nto heal properly).\n• A diet high in sugar increases HCl production. White bread also causes more HCl to be\nmade.\n• In earlier years the recommended treatment included frequent feedings, milk intake, and\na bland diet. But this approach is being discarded.\n• It is now known that the calcium in milk only stimulates acid production rather than\ndecreasing it, as was taught for years. (Milk does initially neutralize HCl, but the calcium\ntriggers gastrin, which causes the walls to excrete more HCl.)\n• In addition, it is now known that sipping milk and cream can lead to myocardial infarcts\n(heart attacks). The problem seems to be the butter fat in the sippy diet.\n• The bland diet approach is also being discarded because those foods neither relieve pain\nnor speed healing. So, instead, eat whatever good food works best for you.\n• Potatoes are very helpful. They are soothing and have an alkaline reaction.\n• Vitamin U is the anti-ulcer vitamin. It is specifically for peptic ulcers. Raw cabbage juice\nand alfalfa have the most. Boiling destroys this anti-ulcer factor, and wilted cabbage\ncontains less vitamin U. Drink fresh, raw cabbage juice immediately after juicing.\n• Eat plenty of dark green leafy vegetables. If symptoms are severe, eat soft foods\n(potatoes, squash, bananas, yams, etc.) Put other vegetables through a blender.\n• If you have a bleeding ulcer, add some psyllium seed to the food.\n• Well-cooked white rice and millet are good.\n• Eat several small meals.\n• Do not eat between meals. Doing so slows emptying of the stomach, and thereby\nincreases HCl amounts in the stomach.\n• Chew food slowly and properly.\n• Also helpful are flax, German chamomile, licorice, catnip, bayberry, goldenseal, hops,\nvalerian, and myrrh.\n• Exercise neutralizes stress. Maintain a daily program of out-of-door exercise.\n• Make sure the bowels move daily or take cleansing enemas.\n• Do not take antacids or painkillers, such as aspirin. That only increases the problem. The\ncalcium carbonate in the antacids doubles the amount of HCl production. The aspirin\ncauses the stomach to bleed!\n• Do not use medicinal drugs.\n• For peptic ulcer pain, apply an ice bag to the abdomen just above the navel. Or place it\non the spine between the shoulder blades.\n—Also see \"Peptic Ulcer—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God fixes no limit to the advancement His children can make, if they will but\nsurrender their lives to His guidance, study, and obey His Inspired Writings.\nPEPTIC ULCER—2\n(J.H.

You have a\nstomach ache, but is it caused by too little HCl, or too much?\n1 - When you have the stomach pain, take a tbsp. of lemon juice. If this makes the pain\nleave, you probably have too little stomach acid, not too much. If it makes your symptoms\nworse, then you have an overacid stomach.\n2 - Do you crave sour foods, such as citrus and sauerkraut? Do you like grapefruit juice?\nIf you do, and they set well on your stomach, then you are underacid. If you do not like\nacid foods, then you may be overacid. If it does not matter, you are probably normal.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Those who make God their strength, realize their own weakness—and God\nsupplies them daily with the help they need.

Ice Bag over stomach, half an\nhour before eating.\nPAIN IN STOMACH—Revulsive Compress over stomach and intestines; repeat several times daily if\nnecessary. Avoid acid fruits, very hot foods, very cold foods, and concentrated sweets, if they cause\npain.\n—Also see \"Gastroenteritis.\"\nPEPTIC ULCER—1\n(Gastric Ulcer, Stomach Ulcer; Duodenal Ulcer)\nSYMPTOMS—Chronic burning or gnawing stomach pain, which often begins 45-60 minutes after\nfinishing a meal or at night. Drinking a large glass of water or eating food relieves it. Vomiting or\nswallowing something quite alkaline also does. The pain sometimes awakens the person at 1 or 2 a.m.\nPain just beneath the breastbone is a frequent symptom of an ulcer. Sometimes it radiates to the back.\nThe pain is often considered to be heartburn or an empty stomach.\nOther symptoms may include headaches, a choking sensation, lower back pain, itching, and possible\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers occurring in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers\noccurring in the top part of the small intestine. However causes and treatment are essentially the same.\nThese ulcers can be caused by wrong food or too much food. They can also be induced by severe\nnervous and mental stress.\nThe walls of the stomach pour a powerful acid into the stomach (hydrochloric acid, or HCl). This\npowerful fluid is needed to digest protein. Although the walls of the stomach are protein, they are not\nnormally disturbed by the fluid. But when there are problems with people or with the food—then trouble\ncan begin.\nThe stomach acids begin digesting the walls of the stomach, because too much HCl is being produced;\nprotective mucous, in order to protect the walls, is not being produced; or both.\nThese ulcers can occur in the esophagus, but generally occur in the stomach or small intestine.\nGastric ulcers (peptic ulcers in the stomach) occur 2½ times more often in men than in women, most\nfrequently in the 40-55 age group.\nDuodenal ulcers (peptic ulcers in the small intestine) occur in the first 11 inches of the small intestine,\nand are caused by excess HCl from the stomach. These ulcers are found in men 4 times as often as in\nwomen, and most frequently between 25 and 40 years of age. Duodenal ulcers occur 10 times more\noften than gastric ulcers. As much as 15% of the U.S. population have ulcers, but only about half are\ndiagnosed. Some are not discovered until the person begins vomiting blood. Ulcers especially occur\nduring the spring and fall, and tend to run in families.\nMany factors affect stomach-acid secretion. Stress and anxiety increase it. Aspirin, steroids, anti-\ninflammatory drugs, and smoking—all increase HCl production.\nWhen you have stomach pain, drink some lemon juice. If the pain gets worse, you have too much acid in\nyour stomach.\nHypoglycemics tend to produce too much HCl and are in danger of eventually having a peptic ulcer.\nIf you vomit blood or have \"coffee-ground\" stools, then the ulcer is bleeding. You are in danger of\nbleeding to death—go to a hospital immediately.",

Do this 4 times each day.\n• Most cases of hepatitis are self-limiting and will heal with rest and supportive care.\n• Avoid sugar, fat, and alcohol.\n• Vitamins B and C are important.\n12\n• He should have bed rest until the acute stage is past; also he should have initial liquid\nfasting, followed by a light diet. The patient often has a poor appetite and does not feel\nlike eating, even though he should.\n• Drink plenty of water, avoid constipation. He should bathe frequently, and wash his\nhands with soap after every bowel movement. The toilet seat should also be washed after\neach usage.\n• He should not prepare food for others, and his own utensils should be sterilized after\neach of his meals.\n• His linen and clothes should be washed separately.\n• In China, 10% of the population have hepatitis at any one time. That is 100 million new\ncases each year. As one might expect, the rate of liver cancer is quite high there.\n• A word to the wise: Gay men often take jobs working in restaurants; yet they have a high\nrate of hepatitis B and C infections, both of which do not reveal symptoms for weeks or\nmonths, during which they can, and do, transmit the infection to customers through food\nthey handle. Something to think about the next time you want to eat in a restaurant or café.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Only those who read the Scriptures, as the voice of God speaking to them, are\nthe true learners. They tremble at the Word of God; for, to them, it is a living reality.\nJAUNDICE—1\nSYMPTOMS—The whites of the eyes yellow, then the mucous membranes, and then the skin\ngenerally.\nCAUSES—When, for various reasons, the liver cannot handle the load placed upon it, bilirubin builds\nup. This is a yellow-brown substance which results from the breakdown of old red blood cells. The liver\nmust constantly remove bilirubin from the blood; and, if this is not done, bilirubin begins collecting in\ntissues all over the body, the urine is darker, and the stools are lighter because the bilirubin it usually\ncontains is not present.\nBut red blood cell destruction can also cause it. Blood tests identify whether the problem is obstruction\nor RBC destruction.\nJaundice is not itself a disease, but rather a symptom of one. It can point to pernicious anemia, hepatitis,\ncirrhosis of the liver, and hemolysis (which is an abnormal destruction of red blood cells). Jaundice can\nalso be caused by a blockage of the bile duct system in the liver, because of gallstones or a tumor. More\nrarely, it is caused by a parasitic infestation, such as tapeworm, hookworm, a flea, or mosquito carrying\na viral infection.\n• Eat only raw fruits and vegetables for a week. Then eat 75% raw foods for a month.\nTake fresh lemons daily during that time.\n• Both alcohol and tobacco are very hard on the liver.\n• Drink fresh vegetable juices.\n• Treatment includes exposure to ultra violet light in order to speed up elimination;\nvitamin C, to bowel tolerance; and vitamins A, E, and selenium.\n• Silymarin, extracted from the milk thistle, helps repair damage to the liver. It is well-\nworth taking.\n• Go on a liver flush. This is done by drinking apple juice alone for 3 days, followed by\ndrinking a cup of olive oil and a cup of lemon juice.\n• Helpful herbs include burdock root, agrimony, celandine, red clover, licorice, dandelion,\nand chionanthus.\n—Also see \"Jaundice—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—All knowledge gained in this life, which will fit us to live with the angels in\nheaven, is knowledge worth gaining.

Skin rashes and itching may also occur; the latter is caused by excess bile salts\nunder the skin.\nCAUSES—Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, and may be caused by a virus, bacterium, or toxic\nsubstance. But, in most instances, the cause is viral. There are actually several main types of hepatitis:\nHepatitis A (infectious hepatitis): Transmitted by contaminated water, milk, or food, it has an incubation\nperiod of 15-45 days. The contagion is highest just before illness begins, so food workers can transmit\nthe disease. Hepatitis A is contagious from 2 weeks to 1 week before the illness starts. It is easily spread\nby person-to-person contact and through contact with food, clothing, linens, etc. It can be transmitted\nfrom animals. Eating shellfish is a good way to get it, even if the waters they live in pass national\nstandards. Recovery generally occurs within 4 weeks. Chronic cases are less likely to occur.\nHepatitis B (serum hepatitis): Found throughout the world and spread as HIV is—through contact with\ninfected blood (contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusions) and sexual contact. Six cases have\nbeen traced to contaminated acupuncture needles. About 5% of all Americans and 85% of gay men have\nit. Hepatitis B is very serious. It has an incubation period of 28-160 days (2-6 months), and recovery\nmay require 6 months. All during that time, it can be passed from one person to another. In increasing\nnumbers, cases are reverting to chronic active hepatitis, which can result in liver cirrhosis and death.\nHepatitis B is the ninth major killer in the United States.\nHepatitis C: Contracted in the same manner as HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C may take 6 months to\nproduce symptoms, yet all that time it can be spread from one person to another. Between 20-40% of all\nhepatitis cases are of this type. It accounts for 90-95% of all hepatitis transmitted by blood donations.\nHepatitis E, hepatitis non-A, and hepatitis non-B also exist, but are of lesser significance in North\nAmerica. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is in epidemic proportions in Africa and Asia, and is\nbecoming a serious problem in Mexico. It is generally contracted from drinking sewage-contaminated\nwater. Such water should be boiled before using.\nAll of the above are primarily viral forms of hepatitis. But there is also one which is caused by toxic\nchemicals. It is called toxic hepatitis. The amount to which the liver was exposed to the poisonous\nchemicals, fumes, drug, etc., determines the amount of damage to that organ.\nOverall, there are 40,000-70,000 reported, new cases of hepatitis each year in America. But the experts\nsuspect that there are probably ten times that many which go unreported. It most often occurs in young\nadults, and is highest in teenage girls.\nHepatitis A is decreasing, and hepatitis B is rapidly increasing. It is fourth among the 30 leading\ncommunicable diseases.",

Drink only distilled water.\n• Then go on juices for several more days. Pear juice and beet juice are very helpful.\nApple is also good.\n• Then add solid food, such as shredded raw beets with 2 tbsp. olive oil, fresh lemon juice,\nand freshly blended, uncooked applesauce. Pears should be eaten generously; they are\nvery healing to the gallbladder. Oil is necessary in the diet, to stimulate the production and\nelimination of gall and the fat-digesting enzyme, lipase.\n• Using only high quality vegetable oil helps keep gallstones from forming.\n• Avoid all meat, grease, processed fats and oils (including margarine and butter).\n• It is crucial that you not overeat! Only eat small meals.\nENCOURAGEMENT—No man or woman can be good or great who has not learned to yield his will\nto God, and to obey with alacrity. Those who learn to obey are the only ones who will be fitted to\ncommand. God has a special work for your life.\nGALLSTONES—1\n(Cholelithiasis)\nSYMPTOMS—Bloating, gas, and discomfort or indigestion after a heavy meal of rich, fatty food.\nWhen a gallstone passes (a \"gallbladder attack\"), the pain can be very severe and last a few seconds or\nminutes, and recur frequently for hours or days. Chills and fever may accompany the attack. The\nsymptoms often occur after the person has eaten fried or fatty foods.\nCAUSES—Gallstones may form in the gallbladder or (more rarely) in the bile ducts of the liver. They\nmay form in the gallbladder as a result of infection or inflammation of the gallbladder wall.\nThey occur more often in women than men, more often women who have given birth to children,\nespecially several of them. They are more frequent in obese women, and occur more often after the age\nof 40. In the United States, about 10-20% of the population have gallstones.\nPersons with diabetes, migraines, cancer of the gallbladder, cirrhosis, and pancreatitis are more likely to\nhave gallstones.\nGallstones are formed from bile, a brown digestive fluid produced by the liver. Cholesterol (a blood\nprotein) combines with the bile to form stones. But they do not look like regular \"stones.\" Whereas\nkidney stones are sharp and crystalline, gallstones are smooth, soft, and gelatinous. They feel like dense\nfat. Often persons with them have no symptoms.\nBut, when they block the exits of the liver or gallbladder, they produce nausea, vomiting, and pain, as\ndescribed above.\n• Go on a liver flush (which see).\nTo relieve pain, give a 15 minutes hot fomentation over the gallbladder area, followed by\nan ice rub. Repeat the process 3 times. This will reduce the swelling, inflammation, and\npain.\n• If you can avoid doing so, do not have an operation on your gallbladder. What they do is\ntake out your gallbladder, and you really need it.\n• Recent studies at the University of Pittsburg found that removing the gallbladder\n(cholecystectomy) doubled the risk of colon cancer.\nPREVENTING GALLSTONES—Here are several points to keep in mind:\nIt is an interesting fact that people who do not eat meat, dairy products, or eggs rarely have gallstone\nattacks. It is animal fat which tends to form gallstones.\nDrinking water helps prevent gallstone formation. It has been discovered that those with gallstones drink\nlittle water.\nDrinking a pint of water causes the gallbladder to empty about 10-20 minutes later. This is the ongoing\nway to keep the gallbladder cleaned out and in fairly good condition; that is, if you do not eat any fats of\nanimal origin.\nLack of exercise increases the likelihood of gallstone formation. Cholesterol is excreted more rapidly by\nthe liver and bladder with more exercise. The truth is that everything works better when you exercise\nregularly.\nDo not overeat. This is very important.\nDo not eat processed, fried, sugared, spicy, or junk foods.\nDo not use alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco.\nKeep your weight down. Overweight women over 40 who have had several children have the most\ngallstones.\nOral contraceptives (and other drugs containing estrogen) increase cholesterol saturation of bile.\nEating eggs greatly increases the likelihood of stone formation. A diet low in vitamin C also does.\nEating lots of refined carbohydrates increase stone formation. Not including enough fiber in the diet\ndoes also.\nTaking 2 tbsp. of lecithin each day immediately results in increased phospholipid concentration in the\nbile. This directly lowers and disperses gallstones.\nAnimal protein in the diet increases stone formation; vegetable protein tends to reduce the size of the\nstones.\n—Also see \"Gall Stones—2,\" and \"Liver Flush.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The strength of Christ was in prayer.

When it happens, it must be cared for immediately. If\nnot, you could die.\nAn acute infection of the gallbladder may be only catarrhal in nature, and recovery will come in a few\ndays. But, in more severe cases, the gallbladder fills with pus. Be very careful, and immediately treat\nthis condition. In case of pus in the gallbladder, there may be (and may not be) chills and fever.\nTherefore be alert, if chills and fever occur.\nThe presence of gallstones tends to irritate the lining of the gallbladder. Then bacteria in the bile are able\nto invade the wall and cause inflammation.\nInflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) produces similar symptoms (plus jaundice) to inflammation\nof the gallbladder, but the treatment is the same.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• To relieve GI pain and expel the gas, take an enema, use a heating pad, hot water bottle,\nhot fomentations to the abdomen, lukewarm enemas—given slowly. Moist heat will be\nmore effective than dry heat, since it penetrates better. If the pain is severe, apply the heat\nfor an hour, remove for an hour, and then apply again for an hour, until relief comes.\n• Take charcoal tablets, to relieve gas and bloating. But do not use it daily or it will cause\nconstipation.\n• The pain may be sharply increased by drinking cold liquids and eating food. It is now\nknown that the pain is generally associated with constipation. (See \"Constipation.\")\n• The person may think he has too much gas, but studies reveal only that the normal\namount of gas in his intestines bothers him more. But it would still be wise to avoid gas-\nforming foods. (See \"Bloating\" and \"Belching.\") Avoid swallowing air. Do not chew gum\nor smoke, drink enough water, and avoid carbonated beverages.\n• Eat more bran (oat bran, etc.) and it will produce more normal bowel movements.\nCoarse bran works better than fine bran. A high fiber diet is particularly important in\nsolving IBS.\n• Add crushed psyllium seed to your diet.\n• Avoid stress, strain, worry, and rush.\n• Avoid tobacco, tea, coffee, soft drinks, alcohol, and drugs.\n• Research shows that refined sugar needs to be avoided if you want to return to normal\nliving.\n• Do not use sugar substitutes (sorbitol, etc.).\n• Do not take antacids or laxatives.\n• Eat on a regular schedule. Do not skip meals or eat between meals. Let your digestive\nsystem rest before the next meal. Five hours between meals is a good rule.\n• Do not eat before going to bed.\n• Search for your food allergies. Keep written records and take the pulse test. (See\n\"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\")\n• Avoid animal fats, butter, fried foods, and dairy products.\n• Because of the ongoing diarrhea, people with IBS require as much as 30% more protein\nthan normal, as well as an increased intake of minerals and trace elements. (See\n\"Diarrhea.\")\n• Studies of patients revealed that 70% of those with IBS had a lactose-intolerance\nproblem. They needed to stop drinking milk in order to partially, or wholly, solve the\nproblem.\n• Regular out-of-door exercise is needed in order to maintain good bowel health.\n• If you want success, stay totally away from cigarette smoke.\n• Do not use medicinal or street drugs if you want improvement.\n• When your intestines upset you, temporarily go on a bland diet. Put vegetables and\nnonacidic fruits through a blender. But be sure and include fiber if you are on a soft diet,\nand some protein.\n• Wear loose-fitting clothing.\n—Also see \"Colitis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—There is a great work to be done in our world, and God has a plan just for you.\nHe has a place for you to work and, though it seems to be ever so insignificant, if you will fill it to the\nbest of your ability, ever trusting in Him for help, He will approve.\n\n(Mucous Colitis, Spastic Colitis,\nIntestinal Neurosis)\nSYMPTOMS—There are three basic patterns:\n(1) constipation and pain; (2) alternating constipation and diarrhea; (3) and painless diarrhea with\nmucous. Diarrhea frequently occurs upon arising, and again following breakfast. For the remainder of\nthe day, he may be constipated. Diarrhea at night is rare. Instead of diarrhea, stools sometimes are pasty\nand very narrow.\nAlso present may be gas, nausea, bad breath, heartburn, severe headaches, bloating, lack of appetite,\nweakness, faintness, backache, and heart palpitations.\nPain is often triggered by eating, and may be relieved by a bowel movement.\nA fifth of those with this problem also experience rectal bleeding.\nCAUSES—Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common digestive problem which patients see\ntheir doctor about. About one-fifth of Americans have the problem. Primarily occurring between the age\nof 20 and 50, women have it twice as often as men. It is said that three-fourths of the population\nexperience it at some time in their lives. Yet IBS is comparatively unknown in cultures where people eat\nsimply, and not too much of it.\nThe fundamental problem is that the muscles of the small and large intestines contract in spasms rather\nthan regularly. Something in the food bothers the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract,—probably the totality of\nthe strange things Westerners eat: processed, greasy, fried, sugared, chemicaled, synthetic, drugged, and\nalcoholed food; and eaten hurriedly, at irregular times.\nThese spasms cause the food to pass through the GI tract either too fast or too slow. When too slowly,\ntoo much water is absorbed, causing hard, dry stools; when too fast, too little water is absorbed and the\nstools are watery.\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a nuisance, but is not life-threatening. But be aware that symptoms of IBS\nmay indicate more serious problems, which sometimes are related by IBS: arthritis, diabetes mellitus,\ngallbladder disease, malabsorption disorders, candidiasis, pancreatic insufficiency, skin disorders, ulcers,\ncolon cancer, and parasitic infections, such as amoebiasis and giardiasis.\nThere are diseases which have similar symptoms, such as diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative\ncolitis, and lactose intolerance.",
