Twelve or twenty herbs are good numbers to work with, in keeping your basic herb supply small. If you wish, subtract some from the above list, add more from the following list, or change the list around to meet your special needs. Few of us are in a position to keep a large variety of herbs on hand. THE NEXT THIRTY MOST IMPORTANT HERBS (A TOTAL OF FIFTY BASIC HERBS) The above set of herbs deal with a wide variety of diseases, which a family might encounter. But there are special problems which one or more of the following would be needed for (example: eyebright for the eyes; squaw vine and wild yam for female problems). Here are the next thirty most important herbs. This brings the total up to the fifty most important herbs.

These last ten are provided to widen, to full width, the number of problems which you can use herbs to deal with.

False Blessed unicorn thistle Marshmallow Blue cohosh root Buckthorn Rue Gentian Uva ursi Ginseng White willow BASIC HERBAL PRINCIPLES 1 - Storage: Herbs are best stored in glass jars. Do not expose them to the sunlight for long periods of time. 2 - Weight factor: Larger persons require larger dosages than smaller or underweight individuals. Women generally require smaller doses than men, due to their lower average weight. Children and elderly people need smaller doses. 3 - Climate: The medicinal effect of herbs is intensified in hot climates, therefore give less at such times. 4 - People vary in their reactions: Some people are more intolerant to herbs than are others. It is best to initially give a smaller dose and see what the effect is going to be. It is always safe to start with the smaller child's dose, then build up to a larger dose if that seems best. Increase slowly, remaining on each level for 2-3 days, to observe for unusual reactions. 5 - Dosage for children: Here is the formula: Divide 150 (the assumed average adult weight) by the child's weight. Example: A child weighs 50 pounds. This is 1/3 of the adult (of 150 pounds.). Therefore give him only a third of the regular dose. 6 - During pregnancy: Women respond to herbs differently when they are pregnant. At such times, it is best to give smaller herbal doses and observe response. Sometimes mild and nutritive herbs are best. Some herbs should not be given during pregnancy (including diuretics, purgatives, and emmenagogues; all of which are active in the pelvic area and should be avoided.) 7 - Nervous people: Give them smaller doses than robust individuals. 8 - High blood pressure: These people should avoid herbs that stimulate the heart or constrict the blood capillaries and arteries (licorice root, ephedra, and lily of the valley are examples). But cayenne and garlic can be used in normal amounts. 9 - When herbs are combined: Herbs are frequently combined; but, if not done properly, one herb may overpower or neutralize the effects of others. 10 - Laxative herbs: Give slow-acting laxatives in the morning, so not to disturb sleep. They may take 13 days to work; whereas fast-acting ones usually take 4-8 hours. Do not increase the dosage until a 3-day period is over, using the same dosage every day. Then, if the desired result is not obtained, you may increase the dosage. The desired objective is generally 2 bowel movements a day. 11 - Sedatives and antispasmodic herbs: Give them on an empty stomach or just before bedtime. 12 - Astringents and minerals: Astringent herbs should not be taken at the same time as nutritional supplements containing iron. The tannins in astringent herbs will leach calcium, iron, and other important minerals out of the intestines. Therefore, only give astringent herbs for a short period of time. 13 - Blood-purifying herbs: Take these herbs on an empty stomach. 14 - Strong, bitter herbs: To avoid nausea, be sure and give enough water with them. 15 - Powerful herbs: Be careful in giving herbs which have powerful effects. These include lobelia, juniper berries, black cohosh, poke root, aconite, and horsetail (shave grass). 16 - Bitter pills: They have a tonic effect on the stomach, digestion, and related organs. 17 - Herbal temperatures: A hot infusion or decoction is used to help induce sweating. Cool teas are used for tonic effect, and warm teas produce a feeling of relaxation. (Vervain is the best for inducing sweating.) 18 - Tablets vs. capsules: Tablets are easier to work with than capsules in hot climates; the latter tend to stick together. Vegetarians either open and empty capsules or use tablets, since capsules are made from slaughterhouse products. 19 - Herbs at mealtime: To avoid taking too much liquid, capsules or tablets are preferable to teas at mealtime. 20 - Varying the intensity of the dosage: Here are several principles to keep in mind: - For a slow, gradual, general effect, give the herbs in small …",

Those who do so, may feel weaker for a few days, but afterwards will generally feel much better and stronger. - Over-indulgence in sex is an excellent way to debilitate the body. Worry wears out the life forces. The use of coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and processed and junk foods are also sources of trouble. - Trust in God, obey the Ten Commandments, and live as healthfully as you can. - A good program of better nutrition, more rest, less tension, and taking time to go outdoors and work or walk 30-60 minutes at a time will do much to build the body. A cold morning shower invigorates the body. - As an aid in rebuilding the body after acute or chronic illnesses, the following herbal formula is quite helpful. It combines nutritional benefits with herbal tonics: Mix together 1 oz. parsley root, 1 oz. alfalfa; 1/2 oz. of each of the following: dandelion root, comfrey root, yellow dock root, burdock root, nettles leaves, and dulse. Place in an uncovered pot with a quart of water and simmer for 20 minutes. Let it cool, then strain. Place the liquid back in the pot and simmer uncovered for one hour or until it is reduced to one cup. Stir in one cup of unsulphured blackstrap molasses and refrigerate. Take one tablespoonful 3 times a day. - A variant method would involve taking the powdered, mixed, dry herbs (not having gone through the cooking stage), place them in #00 capsules, and take 2-4 caps with each meal. HYDRO—Here are water treatments, explained in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), which will increase endurance: Tonic frictions, which include Wet Hand Rub, Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub, Wet Sheet Rub, Dripping Sheet Rub, Ice Rub, and Salt Glow (WTM, pp. 97-105). In cases of severe exhaustion, bed rest for a time, proper diet, plus carefully graduated tonic cold applications, especially Percussion Douche to spine (p. 228).

CAUSES—Emotional stress depletes the nervous system, weakens emotional stability, and fatigues the body. Such stress weakens the functions of the body organs (such as the stomach and liver). This in turn results in malnourishment and a release of toxins into the system. Primary causes would include constipation, autointoxication, nutritional deficiencies, a negative outlook on people and circumstances, and negative input from other people.",

CAUSES—Jetting across several time zones produces a sudden violation of your body's inner clocks. If, from America for example, you fly to Australia or Europe, you will experience jet lag—for you will suddenly be thrust into meals and wakefulness in the middle of \"your night,\" and awake when your body tells you it is time for sleep. DEALING WITH IT—Here are several suggestions, one or more of which may help: - Get extra sleep beforehand. Drink plenty of fluids and be quiet and relaxed during the flight. Fly by day, arrive at night—and then soak up some extra rest. Get out in the sunshine the next day; this will help your body adapt. Obtain some exercise after arriving. Some people try living by their home clock—but most cannot do that. - Try to avoid important decisions during the adjustment days. The general rule is that it will take one day of adjustment for each time zone crossed. So be prepared. - When crossing only two or three time zones, it is known that going west is easier on the body than going east. This is because it is easier to get more sleep on arriving, since you experience more hours that particular day. ENCOURAGEMENT—We should ever seek to realize that the Lord is very near us.

Avoid smoke and food odors. Stay cool, and get fresh air! - You may wish to take 5 charcoal tabs, one hour before the trip begins. Another method is 2 ginger tablets every 3 hours, beginning one hour before the trip. Ginger helps prevent motion sickness, by absorbing acids and thus preventing nausea. - Some recommend additional magnesium (500 mg, one hour before trip) and vitamin B6 (100 mg one hour prior to trip) to relieve anticipated nausea. - In order to settle the stomach before a trip, use the nervine herbs: hops, scullcap, chamomile, and valarian root. Here are more preventative suggestions: - Travel at night. When it is dark, what you see conflicts less with what you sense, and the air tends to be fresher. - Avoid junk food, smoking, and alcohol. Keep a window open and stay near it, all the while breathing that fresh air. - Sit still and do not look around very much. - Look straight ahead. If you are in the driver's seat, you will sense (and have) better control of the movements taking place. Do not read while riding. Keep your eyes on something stationary far ahead.

Symptoms include nose and throat irritations, watery eyes, fever, headaches, chills, muscle aches, and temporary loss of smell and taste. A heavy cold may take the form of acute or chronic infection, such as flu, grippe, tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchial catarrh, chronic cold, or similar virus-type infection. Children who frequently have colds or flus may have thyroid malfunctions. COLDS AND FLU—How can you tell whether it is a heavy cold—or the flu? Here is the difference: Headache - prominent in flu, but rare in a cold. Fever - frequent and sudden in flu; rare in a cold. Fatigue - extreme in flu and can last 2-3 weeks; there is only mild fatigue with a cold. General aches - common and often severe in flu; slight in a cold. Runny nose - occasionally in flu; common with a cold. Cough - common with flu and can become severe; only mild to moderate in a cold. Sore throat - sometimes with flu; common with a cold. —For more on flu, see \"Influenza.\" CAUSES—In one sense, the cause is a variety of viruses. But in another, the person has allowed himself to become run-down so that the virus was able to take hold. Factors which lower the body's resistance to virus infection are overexposure to cold, fatigue, recent or present infections, allergic reactions, and inhalation of irritating dust or gas, overeating, wrong eating, and sugar or alcohol consumption. The common cold is not an infection that leaps out and attacks an innocent passerby. It is not even a disease. A cold is the cure of a pre-diseased condition. and the symptoms are attempts by the body to reestablish normal conditions. The body is carrying out a \"spring cleaning.\" The cold virus can change size and shape, making it impossible to produce a suitable vaccine. There are more than 100 different viruses which cause colds. Symptoms last for 7-14 days regardless of therapy. The incubation period is very short (1-3 days), instead of the 10-21 days for most viruses. The cold seems to suddenly appear. When you get a tingling nose and throat, nasal mucus, or scratchy throat; do not wait for the coughing, weakness, and fever to begin! Go to bed.",

A bronchial cough is tight and painful. A sinus infection generally drips mucus down the throat, producing a cough. Croupy coughs produce a loud raspy sound, bringing up phlegm with difficulty. A few drops of lobelia herb under the tongue every few minutes will relax the cough muscles and may loosen the mucus. Be sure and drink enough water and other liquids, so the mucus does not become thick. Damage to the lung tissues, caused by pneumonia, can result in a chronic cough. While on the subject of coughs, there are two other kinds of cough: Lung cancer or tumors can produce a mild cough, which gradually becomes worse, possibly accompanied by blood.

Cooling Wet Sheet Pack. Cold Friction Bath. Prolonged Tepid Full Bath at 88o F. Cold Full Bath, followed by a short Hot Full Bath, Pail Pour, or Shower. Tepid Pail Pour. Cold Pail Pour. Cold Compress. Graduated Compress. Evaporating Sheet. Cold to head and neck. Cold to spine. Cold to abdomen. Cold over heart. Cold colonic. Tepid or cold enema. Cold water drinking, a measure that should be combined with all the others named above. Cold air bath (p. 39). It is the impression of cold on the thermic nerves of the skin that best increases heat production. The more intense (and sometimes prolonged) this impression, the greater the desired effect. The most intense effects are produced by prolonging the application until the temperature of the body has been slightly lowered. But if the cold is greatly prolonged, or is repeated at short intervals, the heat-rise effect fails (p. 42).

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—A fever is an elevation of body temperature above normal. A fever is not a disease, but a symptom that an infection or disease is present. Fevers are common in a wide variety of diseases, from mild to severe. Symptoms include headache, flushed face, body aches, nausea, little or no appetite, and sometimes diarrhea or vomiting. Skin may be warm with some perspiration, or hot and dry. The elevated temperature is an effort by the body to burn out infection, and the perspiration helps eliminate toxins. Therefore a partial fever may be helpful to the body in fighting the infection. If the fever does not get too high, let it run its course. Many enzymes, antibodies and white blood cell responses are better during slightly elevated temperatures. MORE ABOUT FEVERS—Normal is generally considered to be within a range of 97o to 99o F., but it can vary among individuals. If it is 100o F. or above, it is a fever. One should not have undue concern unless the body temperature rises above 102o F. in adults or 103o F. in children. Then call a doctor immediately. When body temperature is not more than 5o above normal, it does not completely interfere with body functions. But levels above 105o F. are dangerous; at 106o F., convulsions are common; at 108o F., irreversible brain damage frequently results.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—It is the immune system which fights infections, and it does this by triggering defenses against invading bacteria. The antibodies and antitoxins of this system recognize these foreign bodies and send white blood cells to attack them. With his immune system weakened, a person is less able to withstand Epstein Barr virus, candidiasis, food allergies, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, etc. Infections occur more easily. The person is more susceptible to colds, infections, and viruses. CAUSES—Autoimmune disorders can result from conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to kidney disease. Unrelenting stress, chronic allergies, chronic infections can exhaust the immune system. Medicinal drugs, such as cortisone, prednisone and chemotherapy cause immune depression! Beware of them! Other causes of a weakened immune system are vaccinations and immunizations against common childhood and epidemic diseases. The thymus gland seems to be the most affected by this weakening. The thymus gland is especially important due to its production of T-helper cells. Prolonged stress, or toxic exposure to chemicals or radiation can weaken the immune system. Severe infections can both result and cause it. An example of this would be allergies (resulting from immune malfunction) which follow a severe case of rheumatic fever, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or other acute viral or bacterial disease. Lack of proper rest is yet another cause. Yet another cause are nutritional deficiencies. Some natural healing specialists believe that any infectious disease may be considered an immune deficiency problem. The taking of aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, asthma, low birth weight and birth defects. Meat contains hormones, antibiotics, and bacteria which brings on disease. Alcohol, nicotine, and a highsugar diet weaken the immune system. Air pollution is yet another problem (move out of the city!) Hypothyroidism can also result in immune deficiency. Marijuana, cocaine, and the morphine family are other culprits. Mercury amalgam fillings are yet another incipient cause.",

    "title": "Lupus — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—It usually begins suddenly with fever, fatigue, arthritis and/or joint pain. Those with it are frequently misdiagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis. Ninety percent of lupus occurs in women in their 30s. Other symptoms include a characteristic facial \"butterfly\" rash, severe hair loss, and papular skin lesions. This rash forms over the nose and cheeks in something of a butterfly shape (which tends to intensify because of sunlight). The skin lesions are small, yellowish lumps. They leave scars when they disappear. (\"Lupus\" means \"wolf\" in Latin; indicating the rough-skinned appearance it gives to the skin.) Also generally present are kidney disease (in 50% of those with lupus) and low white blood cell count. All this, in turn, produces inflammation of the joints and/or blood vessels, affecting many parts of the body. Sometimes the first appearance of the problem is an arthritic-like condition, with swelling and pain in the joints and fingers. Severe cases can affect the brain and heart. Sometimes the central nervous system is affected, and deep depression, amnesia, seizures, or psychosis can result. CAUSES—Lupus is an inflammatory disease of the connective tissue. It has been classified as an autoimmune disease, since the body is attacking itself. Ultraviolet rays in the sun can trigger the first attack. Stress, childbirth, fatigue, infection, chemicals, and certain drugs can also bring it on. TREATMENT—Dr. Max Gerson used a careful, very nourishing diet, including vegetable and fruit juices and vitamin-mineral supplementation to eliminate lupus in his patients, but the dietary change had to be total or no progress was made. All meat, gravy, fats, junk food, fried food, soft drinks, caffeine, alcohol, etc. had to be eliminated from the diet. The diet had to be low in fat and salt (thus helping the weakened kidneys). - It is best to eliminate all unsaturated fats. Fats quickly become rancid and, in that form, harm the connective tissue, and wear away the myelin sheath which covers the nerves. - Avoid eating alfalfa sprouts, for they contain canavain which, in your body, replaces its arginine. - A vegetable juice fast would be very helpful. - Do not take birth control pills; they can intensify the lupus. - Up to 10% of the lupus cases originate by taking medicinal drugs (New England Journal of Medicine). Pollutants, additives, chemicals, and certain foods can also bring it on. When the cause is drugs, the kidneys or nervous system are generally not affected, the lupus is a milder case, and it tends to stop when the drug is no longer taken. - Parasites are associated with lupus. The parasites excrete droppings which interfere with body functions. Until the blood stream is cleansed and the parasites removed, healing cannot commence. - Allergies can be another causative factor. Search them out and eliminate them. Here are several to consider: beef, cow's milk, wheat, corn, ammonia, hair spray, formaldehyde, perfume ethanol, pesticides. - Those with Raynoud's disease should live carefully, for they are also prone to contracting lupus. Those with lupus are often misdiagnosed as having syphilis. Lupus is not AIDS. HIV destroys the body's immune system, but lupus is one's immune system destroying his body. - Obtain enough rest and exercise. Avoid all stress. - Echinacea, yucca, red clover, pau d'arco, and goldenseal are helpful herbs. ENCOURAGEMENT—God's faithful ones have ever been able to obtain help from Him. Give Him your heart, and He will fulfill all your needs. In His strength, you can obey all that He commands in the Bible.",

    "title": "Sjogren'S Syndrome — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—A variety of symptoms keyed to a lack of mucous-secreting glands to not function properly: dry or parched mouth, burning throat, trouble chewing or swallowing, gritty or sandy eyes, eyes which feel like they have a film over them. Other symptoms include tooth decay, joint pain, digestive problems, dry nose, dry skin, lung problems, vaginal irritations, muscular weakness, kidney problems, burning tongue, and extreme fatigue. CAUSES—Sjogren's syndrome (pronounced SHOW-grens) is a chronic autoimmune disease which was first identified by a Swedish physician, Henrik Sjogren, in 1933. As an autoimmune disorder, Sjogren's syndrome causes the body's immune system to work against itself, destroying mucous-secreting glands, including salivary and tear-producing tissues. Although not life-threatening, Sjogren's is progressive, debilitating, and can permanently damage the eyes and mouth if symptoms are not treated. When Sjogren's occurs alone it is considered \"primary.\" When patients also have an additional connective disease, Sjogren's is called \"secondary.\" These other diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, polymyositis (inflammation of the muscles), scleroderma (thickening and stiffening of the skin) or poyarteritis nodosa (inflammation of the arteries). Anyone at any age can be afflicted with this disease. In the U.S., estimates run to 200,000 to 4 million; of which 90% are women. Because each symptom affects different parts of the body, physicians and dentists often treat the symptom which applies to their field as minor and of little consequence. Tests are available to diagnose the disease. The cause is, so far, unknown. And, to date, there are no known cures. The treatments, some of which are noted below, only help a person live with the condition, rather than solving it. Yet, if it can save your eyesight or an internal organ, it is worth it. TREATMENT—You can learn much more about this condition by contacting the National Sjogren's Syndrome Association, P.O. Box 42207, Phoenix, AZ 85023 (800-395-NSSA); they will send you free literature. - Or contact the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation, 333 North Broadway, Suite 2000, Jericho, NY 11753 (516-933-6365). - They will tell you that artificial tears (eye drops) and salivas, ointments and antinflammatory drugs are among the treatments prescribed. - We asked one individual we know, who has Sjogren's and believes in, and regularly uses, natural remedies, and were told this: - Women with this problem produce too much estrogen, in relation to the amount of progesterone they make. So purchase progesterone cream and rub in on the belly. - For the eyes, add 1/4th tsp. of table salt (or its equivalent in seawater) to one cup of water, bring it to a boil, then let it set until it is tepid. Put some of this in the eyes every so often. Do not use store-bought salt, because it contains aluminum, which may damage the eyes. Take emulsified vitamin A, and use torula yeast. Black walnut husk tea may help. —Also see \"Dry Tear Ducts.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is our present, all-sufficient Saviour. In Him all fullness dwells. It is our privilege to know that Christ will be with us, guiding us even to the end. Trust and obey Him. He will give you grace to do it. Section 1 General Problems Part 7 Aging",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—You are getting old, and you know it. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT—Some people age more rapidly than others. Causes can include heredity, or a debilitating disease. But there can be other reasons. - Exercise is important. Lack of it causes loss of bone and muscle mass, and inevitable physical degeneration. Walk out of doors every day! Your life depends on it. Breathe deeply. Be positive and cheerful as you walk. Hold your head up and enjoy it. - Hearing loss can accompany aging. Too much fat in the diet, and lack of vitamin A can cause hearing problems. Some physicians suggest that hearing loss is a sign of later heart disease. - Processes of aging are accelerated by poor living, wrong eating and drinking habits, and dangerous activities. Some people make themselves prematurely old. - Older people do not absorb nutrients as well as younger people. This includes vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Enzymes and co-enzymes are not produced as abundantly as they formerly were. Food supplements are needed even more than in earlier years. - Eat good, nourishing food, but do not overeat. You are not working hard physically, as you once did. Experimental rats were given much less in food calories, and lived 50% longer. - Systematic undereating is one of the key secrets of longevity. Lose weight and keep slim. Extra weight rapidly ages you. - Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. A high fiber diet is important. If you are not hungry, then do not eat very much. - Brittleness and fragility of bones result as calcium is more poorly absorbed. Make sure you are obtaining an adequate supply of calcium, vitamin D, and copper. - Drink freshly-made carrot juice every day. - If possible, drink only spring or steam-distilled water. Keep your body's water table high. It will go a long way toward protecting you against later heart and blood vessel problems. - There is increased oxidation of cells with the advance of years. Take vitamin E to help safeguard against this. Vitamins A and C are also antioxidants. - The B complex are needed for good brain function, proper digestion, sound nerves, and physical stamina. - Vitamin C in your diet will lessen the likelihood of strokes and blood vessel ruptures. It strengthens the body, and promotes healing of wounds. It fights infection. - Make sure you are obtaining enough minerals. Take a vitamin/mineral supplement so you will get enough potassium, iron, selenium, zinc, and all the rest. - Eat a little Nova Scotia dulse or Norway kelp each day to get those needed trace minerals. - Stop smoking, drinking, and living in excess. Throw out the caffeine and processed foods. Go to bed on time. If you cannot sleep in the middle of the night, pray and thank God for your blessings. Go outside and breathe deeply of the good night air, then go back to bed and to sleep. - As much as you can, stay away from medicinal drugs, and you will be happier for it. - A person who is depressed or negative will age faster. Cheer up, go to God and surrender your life to Him. Obey His Ten Commandment laws and trust your life to Him. Be peaceful in Christ. Find in Him your strength and hope. - It can be more difficult to deal with stress as you get older. God can help you with that also. - Find someone to help, write to, and pray for. - Helpful herbs include ginseng, gotu kola, echinacea, cayenne, pau d'arco, hawthorn, and suma. ENCOURAGEMENT—What a privilege is ours, to be connected with the Majesty of heaven; the One who loved us and gave His life for us. Never forsake Him, and you will be deeply blessed.

SKIN GRAFTS—Paraffin Bath (pp. 79-82). SKIN SCALING—Neutral Alkaline Bath daily for 15 minutes to 1 hour (p. 241). BRUISING (Contusions) SYMPTOMS—Although the skin is not broken, the underlying tissue is injured. The result is some pain and swelling, and perhaps black and blue marks. CAUSE—Contusions occur when the skin is injured, but the skin is not broken. Blood vessels have been ruptured, and thus have released blood into the surrounding tissue, including the skin.",

It may also be caused by an infected wound, an illness, lowered resistance, certain drugs, food allergies, stress, or junk foods. Drugs containing sulphur can produce boils. Leg ulcers are a special problem; they are open sores which develop on the legs. They are more likely to occur in those with varicose veins. Poor circulation causes the skin tissue to break down.

They occur where the sebaceous (oil) glands are most numerous: face, neck, chest, and back. Permanently expanded pores, as well as scarring, can result. CAUSES—A sebaceous gland is located in every hair follicle, and produces oil which lubricates the skin. Some of the oil becomes clogged, bacteria multiply, and inflammation results. This occurs during adolescence (between 12 and 24), when androgens (male hormones) are released in increased amounts in both boys and girls. A few have acne all their lives. Other causes include junk foods, oral contraceptives, allergies, stress, and heredity. The problem is intensified when sebum, combined with skin pigments, plugs the pores—and produces blackheads. If scales below the surface fill with sebum, whiteheads are formed. Canadian Eskimos, prior to 1950, never had acne. When \"modern foods\" were brought in, acne became common.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Red, dry, cracked hands. CAUSES—The low humidity in the fall and winter dries and irritates the skin. The skin of older people has less natural oils. This prepares you for problems. But the other causes, listed below, you can do something about. PREVENTION—If you find you have this problem, there are several things you can do, to prevent or lessen it. - Water removes oils on the skin. But a special kind of water is especially devastating: soapy water. Dish water not only removes oil from the plates, but also from your hands. That is part of the reason why your hands are chapped and your arms are not! When you must wash your hands, try washing only the palms and not the backs—which, having thinner skin, tends to dry out more easily. - Soak your hands in warm (not soapy) water for a few moments. As you do this, some of the water is absorbed by the dry skin. Then pat dry and gently rub a little vegetable oil on your hands. - What you place on your skin is absorbed into your body, so beware of all the creams and lotions on the market. The makers of these products are not required, by the FDA, to include food grade ingredients; yet those lotions are absorbed into your system for the body to have to deal with. - Massage a few drops of glycerine, combined with a few drops of lemon oil (both are available at pharmacies), into your hands at bedtime. - Put oil on your hands at night, and then slip cotton gloves over them. - Hot-air blowers tend to chap the hands; use a towel instead. - Wear white cotton gloves while doing dry work. For harder work, use leather gloves. Regarding gloves, avoid vinyl ones, if you can; they makes the hands worse! The rubber traps the moisture and keeps the skin from breathing. - Use a long-handled brush, when washing dishes. ENCOURAGEMENT—Through Jesus, we can have access to God and be accepted by Him. Take God's promises as your own; plead them before Him as His own Words, and you will receive fullness of joy.",

PREVENTION—Do not expose yourself to the sun for extended periods of time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the highest concentration of ultraviolet rays are present. Reflections from snow water, metal, sand, or white- and aluminum-painted surfaces can intensify the effect. Apply a sunscreen about 30 minutes before going out. Protect your lips, hands, ears, and the back of the neck. Reapply as needed after swimming and sweating. Get a tan gradually, beginning with only a few minutes (never over 15).

The rosacea may disappear, or become permanent. Blackheads or whiteheads are rarely present. It often begins with a frequent flushing, or reddening, of the face. This is most often seen on the nose and cheeks. A burning, or grittiness, in the eyes may be felt. CAUSE—Rosacea, which usually begins in the 40s, is a skin disorder which can become chronic. It is important that you try to eliminate the underlying causes, which are closely related to a wrong diet and way of life. People who flush easily are more likely to develop this problem. White women between 30-50 have it the most. When men have it, the appearance of the face is worse, often accompanied by a roughened, enlarged nose (rhinophyma).",

Make sure your clothes are clean. Choose natural fabrics; cotton and wool enable the absorbed sweat to evaporate from the body. - Foot odors can be caused either by not changing the socks often enough or by wearing rubber or plastic shoes. They will make your feet smell like an old rubber tire. The problem may be the shoes, not your feet. Many people today wear such shoes, since they are so much less expensive than leather ones. - Body odors can also be caused by an excess of toxins in the body which it is trying to eliminate. Are you eating too much or eating the wrong foods? Are you staying up late at night, drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes? Apply a wet sheet pack overnight. It will help pull the toxins out of a heavy meat eater. By morning, the sheet will be stained by the eliminated poisons. Fast one day a week on juice or vegetable juices, or a water fast. Epsom salt baths help the body eliminate toxins. Repeat daily for one week, and then reduce to once a week. - Not eating enough unsaturated fatty acids (quality vegetable oils) or not getting enough zinc can also produce body odor. - Take a tip from hunters who wash with pine soap, so their odor will not be detected by wildlife. Another is old-fashioned glycerine soap. - Another cause of body odor is excessive sexual activity. - Pouring tomato juice on a dog to de-skunk him has been done for generations. Some have found that they can pour some tomato juice in a tub of water, sit in it for a time, shower off and get out—and they also smell fine!

This produces raised areas of skin, called plaques, which are red and often itchy. Because so many cells are rising and dying (as they normally do), they have a raised, silvery, patchy appearance. Psoriasis may be linked to faulty fat utilization. Attacks are related to times of stress, illness, surgery, cuts, certain viral and bacterial infections, sunburn, poison ivy, or poison oak.

It feels like a sandpaper surface. CAUSES—This is a sebaceous and keratinized build up of hard granular plugs in the openings of hair follicles. Many physicians claim that this is a normal condition, but it is actually a deficiency of vitamin A and zinc.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—The small arteries in the extremities constrict or tighten. The hands and feet are extremely sensitive to the cold, and suddenly contract. Lack of oxygenated blood causes the fingers or toes to become whitish or bluish in hue. As a result, the affected area may temporarily shrink in size! Unless these attacks are reduced, ulcers may form, which further damage the tissue and produce chronic infection under, and near, the fingernails and toenails. The hands are the areas most often affected. But it can occur in the fingers and possibly toes, nose, tongue, cheeks, ears, or chin. The blood spasm may initially blanch the area. Tingling, and then swelling, may occur and become painful. The appearance may change to a bright red, as the blood vessels again distend and fresh blood is sent back into the area. The attacks usually do not last long. But, in those instances in which they do, gangrene can develop. CAUSES—A cold attack is generally brought on by exposure to cold or emotional upset. The hands go into the refrigerator for a moment, a difficult written exam must be taken, or a verbal conflict occurs. Spasms of small arteries result. The underlying cause may be less easy to identify. It might be high blood pressure, drugs, connective tissue disease, inflammation of the arteries, or equipment vibrations which injure the blood vessels. Some individuals have lived in a cold, improperly heated environment for too many months or years, and the problem developed. Try to avoid resting or sleeping in ice cold places. Food allergies, junk food, or a poor diet which is high in starches and low in greens, vitamins, and minerals may cause it. Apparently the cause is not a \"thoracic inlet syndrome\"; that is, squeezing of nerves or arteries issuing from the thorax by muscles or bones. Instead of Raynaud's, you might have Buerger's disease (a nerve disorder which gradually cuts off nerve supply to the extremities). Buerger's disease is primarily caused by using tobacco products. (Buerger's is a steady cutting off of nerve flow; whereas Raynaud's is an intermittent blood flow.) Antihypertensives, ergot drugs, channel blockers, or alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers can be the cause. There are two forms of this condition: (1) Raynaud's phenomenon: This may be due to various bodily disorders. It occurs evenly in both men and women, and usually begins after the age of 30. Symptoms in the phenomenon may affect only one side of the body. (2) Raynaud's disease: This is primary disease, and occurs mainly in women. The disease generally begins in the teens or early twenties. But it can occur at any time in the life. Attacks normally affect both sides of the body equally. Frequency of the attacks are significant: They may be rare or occur as often as several times a day. Mild occurrences only last a few minutes; severe ones may continue for hours. Between attacks the hands will at first appear normal; later they may remain slightly bluish. Gradually the attacks will be more frequent and last longer. In later years, the hands will be slightly bluish all the time. The fingers become swollen. The skin turns pale, discolored, shiny, taut, and smooth. The nails become clubbed and deformed. In advanced stages, poor blood supply can weaken the fingers and damage the sense of touch. The sense of feel may decrease and delicate movements become more difficult to perform. Infections and gangrene may occur more frequently in the affected area.",

Fragile and showing horizontal or vertical ridges: B vitamins. Half moons absent: protein deficiency. Thin, flat, and even moon-shaped (concave or spoon-shaped) nails: iron deficiency. Pale nail beds: anemia. Poor nail growth: zinc deficiency. Excessive dryness, very rounded and curved nail ends, and darkened nails: vitamin B 12 deficiency. Splitting nails: lack of hydrochloric acid, sulfur amino acid deficiency. Washboard ridges: Iron, calcium, zinc deficiency. Hangnails: Protein, folic acid, and vitamin C deficiencies. White bands on the nails: protein deficiency. White nails: liver disease, copper excess. White spots: zinc deficiency, thyroid deficiency, and hydrochloric acid deficiency.

During the night, apply a Heating Compress to the feet; and give a Cold Mitten Friction to the feet in the morning, on arising (p. 243). Weak, pronated feet: Put the feet and part of the legs in tubs for Contrast Baths. Begin with a temperature of 110o F., and then after four minutes, change to tap water for 1 minute. Change back and forth 4-6 times, and end with the hot water. During the treatment, the temperature of the hot water should be gradually raised to 115o-120o F., and the tap water gradually lowered to the temperature of ice water. Give the treatment twice a day (p. 115). Infections in feet: Give the same treatment as for pronated feet, above (p. 114). ENCOURAGEMENT—It is Jesus that we need.

Dandruff is a covering of dead skin that prevents new hair from growing, because it cannot break through the dead skin. A scaling or flaking of scalp cells results. It may or may not be accompanied by itching. CAUSES—A change in the surface cells of the scalp results in a scaling or flaking. This change is especially keyed to nutritional deficiencies. It often occurs in those with oily skin who are prone to develop superficial, acute, and chronic bacterial skin conditions. There is generally excess secretion of oil by the sebaceous glands.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—The lens of the eye becomes clouded, so that the eye is unable to properly focus on objects. In advanced cases, the lens is becoming opaque, so that blindness is setting in. Only part of the eye is generally cloudy or opaque, but this can gradually extend to the entire eye. CAUSES—The most common cause is senility. Congenital cataracts occur if the mother had rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, or if the infant has galactosemia (inherited inability to digest galactose [a type of milk sugar, resulting from lactose] properly). These cataracts generally do not get worse. Not using milk products at all can help prevent this in adults. Traumatic cataracts result from blows which rupture the anterior lens capsule, harmful chemicals, intense infrared radiation, or X rays. Radiation causes free radical damage in the eyes. This causes the lens to absorb aqueous humor. The lens becomes cloudy and must be removed, to restore eyesight. People living closer to the South Pole (which has part of its ozone layer stripped away) are more likely to develop cataracts. Other causes include hypoparathyroidism, Down's syndrome, and atopic dermatitis. The longer one has diabetes, the greater the risk of cataracts. Hair dye has been shown to cause cataracts. Only 23% of those not dying their hair get cataracts; whereas 89% of those who dye their hair develop them. Complications of tumors, detached retina, iritis, glaucoma, and severe myopia can also bring it on. Other studies reveal that people with stress, allergies, or who eat seafood (thus ingesting methylmercury) are more likely to develop cataracts. It is now known that a reduction in vitamin C or B in the diet can help produce cataracts. High blood 2 sugar levels and low calcium levels can also bring it on.",

All sweating baths ought, if possible, to be taken just before retiring at night. IMPROVE NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE—Avoid indigestible, spicy, foods and meats. Eat simply of wholesome food. Obtain needed out-of-door exercise, sunbaths, and swimming. RELIEVE NASAL CONGESTION—Alternate Compress to the face; Alternate Sponging or Compresses to the upper spine; Cold Foot Bath under running water if the extremities are cold. GENERAL METHOD—Build up the general health by tonic measures, employing Friction Tonics, at least twice daily. Avoid Hot Baths and too warm clothing. Expose the body, as much as possible, to the open air, but use great care to avoid taking cold by undue exposures; gradually train the body to the point of enduring exposure without injury.

    "content_en": "- If you seem to have pain in the ear, pull on the earlobe. If the pain increases, then you probably have an ear infection. If the pain does not increase, you may have a dental problem. - Keep the ears warm and the person resting in bed, preferably with his head and, perhaps also, his trunk slightly elevated (to assist natural drainage of the eustachian tubes). Surgical draining might be necessary. The fever increases the need for vitamins A and C. Keep the feet warm. Heat applied to the feet will draw blood from the head and improve circulation. - Sit up when practical to do so, to decrease the swelling and start the tubes draining. Swallowing will help ease the pain. Yawning really helps open up the eustachian tubes. - Blow warm air from a hair dryer 18-30 inches from the ear, and blow air toward it. - Warm some oil to body temperature, and place a drop or two in the ear. This will help lessen pain. But do not do this if you think the drum has burst! - A helpful method, used by many for a long time is this: To alleviate pain in the ear, use a little olive oil or garlic oil in the ear, then add a drop or two of lobelia tincture. - Another way to reduce pain is to make a paste, using onion powder or clay packs. Then apply this to the outside of the ear. - Bake a large onion until it becomes soft, and tie it over the ear; this will often give great relief when pain is severe. - Avoid sugar, dairy products, meat, and heavy meals until the crisis is past. Herbal teas are helpful in assisting the healing process. This includes peppermint, echinacea, goldenseal, pau d'arco, and slippery elm. - Because they increase sticky mucous in the body, dairy products increase ear infections. Excessive sweets and starches lower resistance and intensify ear problems. - People with a tendency to ear infection should avoid all cow's milk products. But, in addition to producing so much mucous, it is reported that milk allergies can produce earaches (and even a burst eardrum), simulating otitis media—without an ear infection actually existing. - Avoid cigarette smoke, for it can irritate the eardrum. - Place drops of hydrogen peroxide in the ear, to help clean it out. Then rinse out with water. Do not leave the peroxide there. It can sink through the eardrum and produce a fizzing sound which can last for several years. - Take garlic enemas. These will help disinfect the body of higher levels of toxins that are building up from the infection. Signs of this are chills, fever, general aches, and pain increase.",

    "content_en": "What should you do if the eardrum ruptures? Causes include a severe ear infection, sudden pressure inward on the ear, resulting from diving, slapping, a strong kiss to the ear, or a nearby explosion. During an ear infection, pus builds up and causes pain in the ear. If this pus starts leaking to the outside, then the eardrum has ruptured. - In case the eardrum ruptures, put nothing in the ear until the eardrum is healed. A fomentation on the outside of the ear can be helpful. - Once the infection increases to acute pain, you may need antibiotics. - An alternate method is: When the ear has abscessed and broken, use warm peroxide to wash the ear out. The peroxide will loosen the putrefied matter and bring it out of the ear. This method is probably good for cleaning out the ear; but keep in mind that hydrogen peroxide is best used on outside body surfaces, where oxygen can cause it to fizz into harmlessness. When it gets inside sensitive body parts, it can continue there for quite some time. We know of one individual who had peroxide in his ear for several years thereafter; and, every so often, he could hear it lightly fizzing. - When using water therapy on the ear, be guarded. Hot applications over the area under the ear could cause trouble! - Also see \"Swimmer's Ear.\" HYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments mentioned in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet): Irrigation of the Ear: A lean rubber tube is used to gently (gently!) introduce a flow of water onto the outer ear. The water is never applied with any pressure! It flows to the ear and out to the side. The temperature may be from 100o to 120o F., depending upon the effect desired. The source of water should be on a level with the top of the head (to maintain only a slight pressure). Never use force, because perforation of the ear often exists; and serious injury could result from introduction of water, with any degree of force, into the middle ear. The head should be inclined to the side as the water is applied. The canal of the ear should afterward be carefully dried and covered with a cloth or a warm hand for a few minutes. In cold weather, the ear should not be exposed out-of-doors for at least an hour after warm ear irrigation is applied; and, even after that, a small piece of cotton should be placed in the outer passageway. This measure affords great relief in the pain of acute otitis media and earache due to other causes. In chronic suppurative disease of the ear, this measure is indispensable as a means of cleansing and disinfection (p. 151). Draining the middle ear: Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and face, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the Hot Compress extends below the jaw, the common carotid artery will be dilated (enlarged), which you do not want. An ice bag should be placed below the jaw at the same time, and will increase the effect by contracting the carotid. Draining the inner ear: The inner ear problem may be relieved, when congested, by warm applications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back of the neck, thus diverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or an ice bag to the back of the neck (p. 194). Inflammation of ear: Fomentation over affected part; derivative treatment to legs: Hot Leg Bath, Hot Foot Bath, Prolonged Leg Pack (p. 210). Inflammation of middle ear: Ice to throat of the same side, Fomentation over ear (p. 221). Earache: Ice Bag to the neck of the same side; Fomentation over ear; Hot Ear Douche, if necessary. Protect the ear with warm cotton, to prevent chilling by evaporation after treatment (p. 224). Eustachian tube inflammation: The Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold cloth, covered with flannel, which then heats up and results in improved circulation and a better flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted area. Wring the cotton cloth from cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3 thicknesses about the neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit the flannel snugly but not too tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it the next morning. It should be entirely dry. In eustachian tube inflammation, the compress should extend upward about the lower part of the ear. You may need to hold up this part of the compress (the part by the lower part of the ear) with a bandage that is fastened to it and goes over the top part of the head and back down to it on the other side (pp. 51-53).",

Other possible causes would include: Milk allergies, poor ear circulation, and vitamin A deficiency. The ear drums might be hardened with age. This generally accompanies hardening of the arteries. Catarrhal deafness could be the problem. This starts when an acute infection (such as a cold or the flu) is suppressed and not allowed to run its course and be properly eliminated. A low level infection continues in the ear, and gradually ruins the hearing. When acute diseases are treated with aspirin or quinine, partial or complete deafness can result. Other drugs which cause this effect are aureomycin, streptomycin, barbiturates, cocaine, opium, and their derivatives. Smoking and caffeine cause spasms and narrowing of blood vessels. Other substances to avoid would include lead, mercury, and cadmium. Excessive amounts of noise injures the fine structures in the inner ear and gradually produces deafness.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—A disease of the inner ear, characterized by recurring episodes of ringing in the ears (tinnitus), loss of balance, and severe dizziness (vertigo). There is progressive deafness and a sensation of fullness in the ears. Sudden movement during an attack can induce nausea and vomiting. Sometimes there is an uncontrollable horizontal jerking of the eyeballs. The condition may affect one or both ears. It generally occurs in adults (most often in women, 50-60 years old). The onset is sudden. It may last for hours or weeks, and then return soon again, after years. In most instances, it is experienced only in one ear, and can result in complete deafness in that ear. Vertigo is the sensation that the world is turning around you. Meniere's syndrome accounts for 10-15% of all vertigo (and 5% of all dizziness). (Also see \"Vertigo.\") CAUSES—This often results from a metabolic problem, resulting from a disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, such as is found in hypoglycemia. Impaired blood flow to the brain may be a causative factor. Those experiencing Meniere's syndrome often have a history of vasomotor rhinitis, ear trouble, and allergies. Autopsies reveal an edema in the membranous labyrinth. Other possible causes may include allergies, viruses, infections, and hormonal intolerances. Symptoms exactly like Meniere's syndrome can be caused by a cholesteatoma. This is a tumor-like growth in the middle ear, which gradually pushes on the central nervous system. Consulting with a specialist might be of help in diagnosing the cause. In some instances this is misdiagnosed; and it is actually salicylism, from excessive self-medication of aspirin. That can also cause deafness, ringing in the ears, dizziness, headache, vomiting, confusion, and hyperventilation in the later stages. If that is the cause, stop all taking of aspirin immediately. Fluid retention in the semicircular canals might be putting pressure on the delicate nerves of the inner ear.",

At first, they come and go; in advanced stages, the sound is constant. No one else hears them. There are reported instances in which others have heard the sounds from as much as 4 feet from the person's ear. \"Tinnitus,\" in Latin, means \"to tinkle,\" or a \"bell-like ring.\" The frequency of tinnitus increases with age. The left ear seems to produce the sounds more often than the right ear. About 75% of deaf people report tinnitus. CAUSES—There are several possible causes, including an irritation of nerve endings in the ear by loud noises. Chemicals and drugs can injure the internal ear. Prescription drugs can produce tinnitus or hearing loss (beware of quinine and aspirin). Nicotine constricts blood vessels and may be the cause. Other causes are lead; aluminum; mercury poisoning; impacted wax; hormonal problems; high blood pressure; severe blows to the head; anemia; perforation of the tympanic membrane; fluid in the middle ear; epilepsy; migraine; food allergy; Meniere's disease; hypothyroidism; multiple sclerosis; as well as repeated and prolonged exposure to loud noises.

Those which are of Streptococcus Group A origin tend to produce a higher fever than viral sources (upper respiratory infections, cold viruses, flu, etc.). Anything irritating to the throat can initiate the problem (such as chronic coughing and loud talking). Other irritants include smoke, dust, fumes, very hot foods or drinks, abrasions, tooth and gum infections, loud talking, or chronic coughing. Smoking is a major cause of sore throats. Bacteria on toothbrushes can cause sore throats. Buy a new toothbrush or boil the old one at least once a month. Between uses, store the toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide—but rinse it well before using. If a sore throat continues or recurs, it might be the onset of mononucleosis (especially if the sore throat lasts more than 2 weeks). Do not dally; go to bed and get well. A sore throat can be the first sign of something more serious: a cold; the flu; mononucleosis; herpes simplex; Epstein-Barr virus; or several childhood diseases, such as chickenpox or the measles. Sometimes a sore throat can lead to chronic fatigue syndrome, gingivitis, epiglottitis, diphtheria, laryngeal cancer, or an abscess around the tonsils.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Loose-fitting dentures; dentures which may hurt the gums when chewing; dentures which cause difficulty in speaking properly. CAUSES—Dentures are false teeth. The professional explanation for the problem is that the wearers do not take proper care of them, and that the gums periodically change shape, etc. There is another, less-known, reason: When the decision is made to extract teeth and fit an individual for dentures, the teeth are pulled out and the molds prepared for the false teeth. The entire process is done as quickly as possible, so teeth will appear to be in the mouth again as soon as possible. In addition, it is a convenience to the dentist to take the molds the same day that the extractions were done. But when the extractions are made, the gums understandably swell! A number of sizeable wounds have been made in the mouth, and the gums are swollen and inflamed. That is not the time to take the molds. Instead, the person should wait at least one week for the gums to heal and readjust into their normal postdental sizes and shapes. Then those molds should be made. If your dentist tells you that you need all your teeth pulled out, discuss the matter with him and perhaps check with another dentist or two. Very often only certain teeth need be removed and a bridge can be installed, which locks onto the teeth which remain. This is far better than wearing dentures. Do all you can to keep your teeth.",

By yourself, read aloud from books and learn how to articulate vowels, consonants, and various combinations. - Temporary denture adhesives may be necessary when you are first getting used to your new dentures. But you should not need to rely on adhesives all the time. The dentures should fit properly. Do not let the dentist take molds too soon. - When you can, take out the dentures so the gums can rest. - Begin by eating soft foods, and gradually get used to chewing with dentures. - After each meal, scrub the dentures with soap and lukewarm water. Wash your gums gently with a soft toothbrush, to remove the plaque. - Massage your gums every day. Place your index finger over the outside of the gums, another finger over the inside portion, and rub back and forth. - Rinse your mouth each day with warm water mixed with a tsp. of salt.

Section 5 Gastro-Intestinal Part 3 Gas and Vomiting HICCUP (Hiccough) SYMPTOMS—Hiccups that you want to have stopped. CAUSES—Charles Osborne of Anthon, Iowa, started hiccuping in 1922 and hiccuped for the next 65 years. After 430 million hiccups, he passed away. Almost all hiccups are one-sided; that is, only one side of the diaphragm contracts. Overeating or excessive drinking is the most common cause. It causes the stomach to extend downward and press against the diaphragm—which then starts its hiccuppy motions. A hiccup is a repeated involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, immediately followed by a sudden closure of the glottis. But that information does not help solve the problem. Here is advice that may. All of these methods really work for some people. See what is best for you. (You will notice that these techniques are frequently based on diverting attention, changing the ongoing physical hiccup pattern, and getting the body to do something different for a few moments.)",

This backing-up action is called reflux. These juices include hydrochloric acid, which is a rather powerful acid. It is used in industry, to clean metal. When it comes in contact with the esophagus, it burns the wall. Normally, the esophageal sphincter muscle shuts and prevents stomach acids from pushing upward. Heartburn can be caused by excessive consumption of fatty or fried foods, alcohol, coffee, spicy foods, chocolate, or just having too much food in the stomach. Citrus fruits or tomato-based foods cause it in a few people. Other contributing factors are hiatal hernia, allergies, stress, gallbladder problems, and enzyme deficiencies.",

Yet, without it, they cannot properly digest protein foods. When the stomach does not have enough HCl, intestinal bacteria and yeast (candida albicans) are able to enter it and ferment high carbohydrate foods (juice, fruit, breads, etc.). Continued low HCl production results in B , calcium, and protein deficiencies. New food allergies can 12 begin, because large fragments of food pass through the gastro-intestinal tract undigested.",

The pain may spread to the back and is made worse by moving. Food, alcohol, and vomiting may worsen the pain. Chronic cases: The pain is milder and pain attacks do not come on suddenly. There is excessive gas, muscle aches, and fever. Permanent damage to the pancreas can occur, because the constant inflammation can produce fibrosis in that organ. The chronic state results in irreversible changes in the gallbladder. Other symptoms of pancreatitis include abdominal swelling and distension, hypertension, sweating, and abnormal fatty stools. Diabetes, digestive problems, and cancer can also result, as well as hearing, respiratory, and kidney failure. CAUSES—Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Normal cells are replaced with scar tissue and calcium deposits. It frequently produces mild diabetes. The most frequent causes of pancreatitis are drinking alcohol, viral infection, and diseases of the bile ducts or gallbladder. A diet rich in fats and meat lays a solid foundation for pancreatitis to occur. Other causes include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, and a considerable variety of prescribed medications. Oral contraceptives, steroids, estrogen, and ACTH can also do it. To this list should be added abdominal injury, obesity, poor nutrition, and electric shock. Certain diseases can also induce it: hepatitis, mumps, and possibly anorexia nervosa. The pancreas produces two important hormones: insulin and glucagon; both of which regulate blood sugar levels and aid digestion. As a result, pancreatitis can produce glucose intolerance and diabetes.",

    "content_en": "CARING FOR YOUR LIVER—There are few organs in your body as vital as the liver. It not only is the largest organ, it also performs more different functions than any other organ in your body. Only God could make the liver. That relatively small structure (it only weighs four pounds) does literally thousands of different things; all of them are quite complicated, involving complex chemical changes. The liver is truly a special gift from God. There are six fundamental things which tend to damage the liver: 1 - Overeating. This is an excellent way to ruin your liver. Just eat all you want, and you will wear it out. 2 - Eating and drinking the wrong things. Here are some of those items which your liver does not wish to face: refined white flour-products, processed foods, junk foods, white sugar products, imitation foods. Beware of potato chips and corn chips. What is an imitation food? It is a food made to appear like the original, yet which has been stripped of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and most everything else that might be worthwhile while carbohydrates, sugar, fats, protein, synthetic colors, flavors, and odors are there to give the appearance and taste of real food. 3 - A low protein, high carbohydrate and fat diet. To make it even worse, make sure it is full of saturated or hydrogenated fats. All kinds of snacks in the stores consist of this. Fried foods may be a devilish delight, but they only add to the eventual misery. 4 - Take the specialty food poisons: alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, theobromine, and hard drugs. 5 - Take medicinal drugs. Select from over-the-counter items or those which are prescribed. They will provide you with a real witch's brew of physical horror, much of it not known and realized until later. With hardly an exception, medicinal drugs are poisons. The liver has to work overtime in order to try to excrete these dangerous chemicals. Some substances which are called \"drugs,\" such as charcoal, are not drugs. They are natural substances which help your body. It is true there are some poisonous herbs, but these will be readily found in the drugstore. The rest, found in the meadow and forest, are for the healing of the nations. 6 - Associate closely with insecticides, preservatives, and other cumulative poisons. Some poisons directly damage the liver (alcohol, oral contraceptives, caffeine, etc.); others damage organs which the liver relies on for help (the pancreas, kidneys, etc.). Here are some dietary suggestions: Do not use nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, fish, fowl, meat, salt, soft drinks, sugar foods, tea, or fried foods. Avoid foods which tend to constipate. When there is a backup in the large colon, toxins are reabsorbed into the system, and the liver labors to eliminate them. Make sure you obtain foods high in potassium. This includes rice, bananas, blackstrap molasses, wheat bran, almonds, seeds, kelp and dulse, brewer's yeast, prunes, and raisins. Drink lots of water; and, if at all possible, drink only pure water. Drink a little every hour. Emphasize raw foods in your diet. Drink fresh vegetable juices, especially carrot and beet. Only eat raw nuts and seeds. They must be fresh and not stale! Use only cold-pressed vegetable oils,—and no other type of oils and no grease (margarine, butter, shortening, or meat fat). Vitamin K is important, to help prevent cirrhosis of the liver. Do not take too much vitamin A. For the same reason, do not eat fish more than twice a week. Avoid cod liver oil. Better yet, stop eating fish. Meat eating is also harmful to the liver. Anyone taking over 50,000 IU of vitamin A for over a year should either reduce intake or switch to natural beta-carotene, which is safe. Do not drink milk or eat pastries, stimulants, white rice, black or white pepper, fried or fatty foods, cheese, and refined or processed foods. Never eat raw or undercooked fish, meat, or poultry. There is a serious risk of infection from doing this. Meat eating is a major source of bacteria parasites, viruses, and various malignancies. When taking supplements, either chew them up well or take them with a glassful of water. Use celandine and silymarin (which is milk thistle extract) every day to help maintain good liver function. But do not use celandine during pregnancy. The lemon and the liver are sweethearts. The lemon is one of the best friends that the liver has. Coenzyme Q10 helps supply oxygen to the liver. Lecithin helps prevent fatty buildup in the liver. In addition to taking care of your liver, treat your kidneys well also. Poor kidney function results in damage to the liver. Drink water! (See \"Kidney problems.\") Do not use harsh laxatives. But do keep the colon clean. Take no drugs if you want your future years to be happy ones. Be good to your liver, and it will help you in years to come. It is a well-known fact, among natural healers, that, if the liver is all right, cancer can be eliminated. But if the liver is too far degenerated, the hoped-for solution may not be achieved. ENCOURAGEMENT—The knowledge of God is as high as heaven, yet He can reveal to you all you need, just for today, if you will but give your life daily into His hands.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Weakness, nausea, headache, vomiting, fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite, drowsiness, dark urine, joint stiffness and pains, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, lightcolored stools, and often jaundice (a yellowing of the skin, which will first be noticed in the eyes and mucous membranes). Skin rashes and itching may also occur; the latter is caused by excess bile salts under the skin. CAUSES—Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, and may be caused by a virus, bacterium, or toxic substance. But, in most instances, the cause is viral. There are actually several main types of hepatitis: Hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis): Transmitted by contaminated water, milk, or food, it has an incubation period of 15-45 days. The contagion is highest just before illness begins, so food workers can transmit the disease. Hepatitis A is contagious from 2 weeks to 1 week before the illness starts. It is easily spread by person-to-person contact and through contact with food, clothing, linens, etc. It can be transmitted from animals. Eating shellfish is a good way to get it, even if the waters they live in pass national standards. Recovery generally occurs within 4 weeks. Chronic cases are less likely to occur. Hepatitis B (serum hepatitis): Found throughout the world and spread as HIV is—through contact with infected blood (contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusions) and sexual contact. Six cases have been traced to contaminated acupuncture needles. About 5% of all Americans and 85% of gay men have it. Hepatitis B is very serious. It has an incubation period of 28-160 days (2-6 months), and recovery may require 6 months. All during that time, it can be passed from one person to another. In increasing numbers, cases are reverting to chronic active hepatitis, which can result in liver cirrhosis and death. Hepatitis B is the ninth major killer in the United States. Hepatitis C: Contracted in the same manner as HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C may take 6 months to produce symptoms, yet all that time it can be spread from one person to another. Between 20-40% of all hepatitis cases are of this type. It accounts for 90-95% of all hepatitis transmitted by blood donations. Hepatitis E, hepatitis non-A, and hepatitis non-B also exist, but are of lesser significance in North America. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is in epidemic proportions in Africa and Asia, and is becoming a serious problem in Mexico. It is generally contracted from drinking sewage-contaminated water. Such water should be boiled before using. All of the above are primarily viral forms of hepatitis. But there is also one which is caused by toxic chemicals. It is called toxic hepatitis. The amount to which the liver was exposed to the poisonous chemicals, fumes, drug, etc., determines the amount of damage to that organ. Overall, there are 40,000-70,000 reported, new cases of hepatitis each year in America. But the experts suspect that there are probably ten times that many which go unreported. It most often occurs in young adults, and is highest in teenage girls. Hepatitis A is decreasing, and hepatitis B is rapidly increasing. It is fourth among the 30 leading communicable diseases.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—The whites of the eyes yellow, then the mucous membranes, and then the skin generally. CAUSES—When, for various reasons, the liver cannot handle the load placed upon it, bilirubin builds up. This is a yellow-brown substance which results from the breakdown of old red blood cells. The liver must constantly remove bilirubin from the blood; and, if this is not done, bilirubin begins collecting in tissues all over the body, the urine is darker, and the stools are lighter because the bilirubin it usually contains is not present. But red blood cell destruction can also cause it. Blood tests identify whether the problem is obstruction or RBC destruction. Jaundice is not itself a disease, but rather a symptom of one. It can point to pernicious anemia, hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and hemolysis (which is an abnormal destruction of red blood cells). Jaundice can also be caused by a blockage of the bile duct system in the liver, because of gallstones or a tumor. More rarely, it is caused by a parasitic infestation, such as tapeworm, hookworm, a flea, or mosquito carrying a viral infection.",

In locations where the disease is common, mortality is about 10-20%. This disease can easily be diagnosed as something else. It is important to determine the true nature of the infection early. CAUSES—This is an infectious disease caused by the leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, a spirochete bacteria. Rats, dogs, and various wild animals carry it. People are infected when urine-contaminated water (generally from rats) penetrates cuts on their fingers or during butchering and skinning of infected animals. The rats are not harmed by the disease. Leptospire is a parasite which travels to the liver and greatly multiplies there, but can also be found in the blood (in the early stages) and in the urine (later). Blood tests or urine cultures are necessary for diagnosis.",

In the later stages, anemia, edema, and easy bruising, due to bleeding beneath the skin. CAUSES—Cirrhosis is a hardening of the liver, because of too much connective tissue and a degeneration of the active liver cells. It can be caused by certain poisons, chief among which is alcohol. Certain infectious diseases can cause special types of liver cirrhosis, of which viral hepatitis is outstanding (see hepatitis). This is especially true of syphilis (which see), which produces nodes in the liver. Malnutrition, caused by lack of food or eating junk food, can also lead to cirrhosis. The liver cells harden and scar, causing them to no longer function normally, due to the scarred tissue. This prevents the blood from passing properly through the liver.",

    "title": "# Liver Flush — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "WHAT IT IS—The liver filters the blood and excretes much of that waste through the bile, which it sends into the gallbladder. When some oil or fat is in a meal, its presence signals the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out some bile, which helps prepare those oils and fats to be properly absorbed by the body. A liver flush occurs when much of the bile is flushed out of the gallbladder. However, there is the possibility that gallstones may be in the bladder. So phase one of the liver flush is to melt down those stones; and then, in the concluding phase, the bile and the stones are jolted out of the gallbladder into the small intestine. HOW TO DO IT—There are several ways this can be done: 1 - This method is used for the purpose of flushing out gallstones, after first softening them: Take 3 tbsp. of olive oil with the juice of a lemon before bed and upon awakening. Stones are often passed and eliminated in the stool with this method. Look for them. You can use grapefruit juice instead of lemon juice. 2 - Here is a more involved three-day pattern for more effectively flushing gallstones: Go on a liver flush by drinking apple juice alone for 3 days. On the third day, the juice is followed by drinking a cup of olive oil and a cup of lemon juice. 3 - This method is used for cleaning out the liver and gallbladder rather than eliminating stones: To cleanse the liver and gallbladder, drink as much pure apple juice as possible for 5 days. Add pear juice occasionally. Beet juice also cleanses the liver. 4 - Here is a more complicated formula for doing the same thing: On two evenings, drink 1 cup of a mixture, composed of equal parts of fresh lemon juice and olive oil (2 oz of each). On the third evening, take a double dose (4 oz of each). On the following morning, take an enema, then a second enema to which 1 cup freshly brewed coffee has been added. This coffee enema should be retained for as long as possible—up to 20 minutes. Repeat this coffee enema in the evening. The above treatment tends to cleanse the liver of toxins and impurities. Coffee, although never suitable for drinking orally, has the peculiar quality of cleansing the liver when taken in enema form. As such, it is widely used to purify the liver so it can resist cancer and throw it off. It is well-known, among natural healers, that the body can eliminate cancer if the liver is in good condition. (See cancer.) In no other way is coffee ever useful inside the body; but, as medicine to cleanse the liver, it has been used with marked success. 5 - This is a still more involved regime for restoring the functioning capacity of the liver and gallbladder. Slightly different than #2, above, it should not be used on anyone below the age of 25 or who has large gallstones: On Tuesday through Sunday noon, drink as much apple juice or apple cider as you are able, in addition to your regular meals. At noon on Sunday, eat a normal lunch. Three hours later, dissolve 2 tsp. of disodium phosphate in an ounce of hot water, and drink it. It may not taste good, so follow it with a little freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Two hours later, repeat the drinking of the disodium phosphate and the grapefruit juice. That evening, only take citrus juice for supper. At bedtime, either (1) drink a half cup of unrefined olive oil, followed by a small glass of grapefruit juice or (2) drink a half cup of warm, unrefined olive oil blended with a half cup of lemon juice. Go immediately to bed and lie on your right side with your right knee pulled up close to your chest for 30 minutes. The next morning, one hour before breakfast, drink 2 tsp. disodium phosphate, dissolved in 2 oz of hot water. Eat your meals as usual. The cleansing regime of the liver and gallbladder is completed. In case there is slight to moderate nausea when taking the olive oil and citrus juice, this should be gone by the time you go to sleep. But if the oil induces vomiting (which only happens rarely), you need not repeat the procedure at this time. Drink a cup of strong peppermint tea, to help relieve the nausea. You may find small gallstones in the stool the following day. They look light green to dark green, are very irregular in shape, are the size of grape seeds to cherry seeds, and feel like gelatin. If there are a large number of them, repeat the liver flush in two weeks. ENCOURAGEMENT—We see in the Word of God warnings and promises, with God behind them all. We are invited to search this Word for aid when brought into difficult places. If we place God and the Bible first, we will have divine help in meeting all our problems. Section 5 Gastro-Intestinal Part 7 Gallbladder GALLBLADDER INFLAMMATION (Cholecystitis) SYMPTOMS—Severe pain in the upper right abdomen, accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting. The abdomen may be rigid and is usually tender to pressure at, or below, the lower edge of the ribs on the right side. CAUSES—The gallbladder becomes inflamed. When it happens, it must be cared for immediately. If not, you could die. An acute infection of the gallbladder may be only catarrhal in nature, and recovery will come in a few days. But, in more severe cases, the gallbladder fills with pus. Be very careful, and immediately treat this condition. In case of pus in the gallbladder, there may be (and may not be) chills and fever. Therefore be alert, if chills and fever occur. The presence of gallstones tends to irritate the lining of the gallbladder. Then bacteria in the bile are able to invade the wall and cause inflammation. Inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) produces similar symptoms (plus jaundice) to inflammation of the gallbladder, but the treatment is the same.",

But pain and tenderness with pressure are not enough symptoms to determine appendicitis. There will also be rigidity and tenderness of the muscles of the abdominal wall, especially on the right side, a little below the level of the naval. Coughing and deep breathing make the pain worse. The attack may, or may not, begin with a chill; but generally some, or much, fever is present from the beginning—along with constipation, vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, and a tendency while lying in bed to draw up the right leg to relieve tension on the sore side. CAUSES—The appendix is located on the right side of the abdomen, about halfway between the point of the hipbone and the naval. Causes of appendicitis include constipation; overeating; eating rich, complicated foods and foods low in fiber. The resulting fermentation and digestive upset can produce appendicitis. IF THE APPENDIX RUPTURES, the infection will spill into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis. Take him to a hospital immediately, so he does not die!",

When this does not happen, waste material moves too slowly through the large bowel. Elimination becomes painful, and toxins are reabsorbed by the system, placing an overload on the liver and kidneys. All waste in the body should be expelled within 18-24 hours. A number of different physical problems are partially caused by constipation: bad breath, body odor, depression, appendicitis, fatigue, gas, headaches, hernia, indigestion, the malabsorption syndrome, varicose veins, obesity, insomnia, and the coated tongue. Toxins, reabsorbed from a constipated bowel, can also result in migraines, chronic gas and bloating, thyroid problems, meningitis, and myasthenia gravis. Constipation tends to be common during pregnancy. Older people often have constipation because they are not drinking enough water.

Possible causes include overeating, food poisoning, stress, incomplete digestion of food, taking certain drugs, flu, intestinal parasites, caffeine, contaminated water, infection (viral or bacterial), eating certain foods (such as unripe fruit, spoiled protein, or rancid fats), eating soap (from improperly rinsed dishes), ingesting certain chemicals, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, etc.), cancer, traveling to foreign countries, poor digestion, or lactose intolerance from milk products. Giardia lamblia, a microscopic parasite, is the most common form of water-borne infestation in the United States. A rich meal of wine, lobster, creamy desserts and all the trimmings is a good start toward diarrhea. It is all too much for the body to handle. The body rejects the whole thing and sends it all out.

SOLUTION—A small, cold enema is especially useful in retraining the colon to evacuate normally by itself. Cold water has a bracing, strengthening, enlivening effect. In hydrotherapy, the enema is considered cold if the temperature is 55-70o F.; whereas it is only cool if it is 70-80o F. The cold enema is a powerful stimulant to bowel movements and should be more generally used for this purpose instead of the warm enema. Use the cold enema to overcome both the enema habit and the cathartic habit (always needing a laxative). Obtain an ear irrigation syringe from the drugstore, and inject one syringeful of cold water into the rectum. Hold it for one minute, and expel. A bowel movement will generally follow. Use this treatment at the same time every day, to establish a pattern of regularity. LAXATIVE AGENTS—Laxatives are supposed to promote bowel movements, but some only hinder it. Bran, psyllium, and raw fruits and vegetables are bulk-forming agents, and are not referred to as \"laxatives.\" They are ideal ways to promote bowel movements, and are safe to use on a long-term basis. Mineral oil and docusate sodium are stool softening agents. If used at all, they should only be used temporarily. The mineral oil can damage the lungs, if inhaled, and absorbs fat-soluble vitamins in the digestive tract. Docusate sodium increases toxicity of other drugs, and may cause liver damage. Salts are osmotic agents, which draw water into the bowel for a flush. These are safe if used only occasionally, but otherwise can initiate dependency. In addition, some people dare not take extra salts into their body. Examples include milk of magnesia, Epsom salts, and table salt. Stimulant agents cause a laxative effect by irritating the intestinal walls and induce peristalsis. But they can result in dependency and can damage the bowels. Examples include various drugstore items; castor oil; senna; and laxative herbs, such as cascara sagrada. ENCOURAGEMENT—Friendship with God, what privilege can be greater? Study His Bible, pray often, and tell others how wonderful He is. Tell them that God is love. This can give them the peace and rest they so much want. Section 5 Gastro-Intestinal Part 10 Anus HEMORRHOIDS—1 (Piles) SYMPTOMS—Burning, pain, itching, inflammation, swelling, irritation, seepage, and bleeding. CAUSES—Hemorrhoids are enlarged varicose veins, found in the anus and rectum. Those occurring below the internal sphincter (a circular muscle which closes the rectum) are called external hemorrhoids. Those above that sphincter are called internal hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids are generally painless, but often bleed. When they do, the blood is bright red. External hemorrhoids are also called piles. Sometimes they protrude from the anus. Because they enlarge and lose their elasticity, they often form little sacs which protrude into the anal canal. The skin above them turns blue or purple and can be extremely painful. A prolapsed hemorrhoid is an internal one which is protruding outside the anus. Often there is a mucous discharge and heavy bleeding. They can be very painful. When they bleed, a fair amount of blood can issue forth. But it does not indicate a serious disease. Older people are more likely to have them. Pregnant women, and women who have had children, tend to have hemorrhoids more often than other younger people. Circulatory weakness of the veins, along with constipation, are primary causes of hemorrhoids. Liver congestion can also be a factor. Any condition which increases pressure on that area or reduces the flow of blood through those veins can induce hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are common in folk who live on junk food diets, low-fiber diets, lack exercise, are sitting while working (especially sitting when tense and nervous), do heavy lifting, are obese, pregnant, straining at the stool, heavily coughing, frequently sneezing, have prolonged use of laxatives or enemas, have elevated pressure on the portal vein of the liver (as occurs in cirrhosis of the liver), and sit on something cold.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Thin people who try to keep losing more weight. CAUSES—Both Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are obsessive eating disorders, but they are not the same. Anorexia describes people who, although thin and often weak, are certain that they need to lose more weight. They fear food and weight gain, and will hardly eat. Bulimia describes people who try to eat less, then go on eating binges because they feel starved. Each one is concluded by purging (induced vomiting) in order to bring up the food eaten. (See \"Bulimia.\") Believing they are overweight, fearful of gaining more, these individuals rather consistently try to keep themselves starved. They tend to have low self-esteem, and often are depressed. Certain that they look terrible, and sure that eating still less might solve the problem, these folk have a thinking pattern which is difficult to change. In some cases, drug and/or alcohol abuse is also involved. Lack of proper nutrition tends to intensify the feelings and attitudes. Almost all anorexics are women, typically between the ages of 12 to 18. The word, \"anorexia,\" means \"appetite loss,\" and technically could apply to anyone who has an ongoing disinclination to eat food. This can be caused by stress, malnutrition, shock, or injury. But, today, the term is generally applied only to those who have anorexia nervosa. This article only applies to this latter definition. Some consider anorexia nervosa to be a psychiatric illness. Others believe that reaction to a strong, underlying collection of allergenic foods is the problem. The often repeated phrase, \"I always feel better when I don't eat, and feel bad when I do,\" can apply to both viewpoints. About a third of those with this problem prematurely die from starvation, infections, heart disorders, or suicide. The underlying cause must be dealt with. Love and understanding is needed. Help from someone outside the family may be needed. However, there is danger in consulting professional counselors or psychologists, since they have been trained in hypnotic procedures; a growing number of instances are occurring where so-called \"repressed memories\" are implanted in the counselee. —And that only adds to the problems!",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—The people appear normal, and the symptoms occur in secret. CAUSES—Bulimia describes people who try to eat less to keep their weight down; then, every so often, they go on a eating binge. This is followed by purging (induced vomiting) or the taking of laxatives, so the food will be eliminated without being properly digested. (Also see \"Anorexia nervosa.\") Bulimia can result in serious physical problems, including hypoglycemia, internal bleeding, ulcers, erratic heartbeat, kidney damage, menstrual cessation, low pulse rate and blood pressure, and glandular damage. Some bulimiacs overdo on exercise, in order to better manage weight and somehow improve an already unbalanced situation. Professions requiring a beautiful appearance are where we are most likely to find bulimiacs (models, actors, dancers, ballet dancers). By her own admission, Princess Diane is a bulimiac. Thinness is equated with beauty by many people. Oddly enough, while anorexics tend to be overly thin, bulimiacs are generally just right; not too heavy or too thin. But their way of life may produce hair loss, yellow skin, premature wrinkles, muscle fatigue, dizziness, and extreme weakness. The primary physical signs are those which are caused by sessions of induced vomiting: swollen salivary glands, constant sore throat, hiatal hernia, esophageal inflammation, erosion of the enamel of the back teeth, swollen glands in the face and neck, and broken blood vessels in the face. If laxative abuse is done, then rectal bleeding, bowel damage, and chronic diarrhea may result. Excessive laxative use removes an excess of potassium and sodium, leading to muscle spasms, dehydration, and eventual cardiac arrest. Bulimiacs tend to have low levels of serotonin, which can lead to increased cravings for simple carbohydrates (sugars). Yet it is likely that the binges produced those chronically low levels.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Diarrhea, gas, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms generally begin 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating dairy products. In infants, symptoms include foamy diarrhea with diaper rash, slow weight gain and development, as well as vomiting. CAUSES—Lactose intolerance is inability to digest milk sugar. The intestinal wall is not able to make the digestive enzyme, lactase, which is needed to split lactose into glucose and galactose. When the lactose is not split, it remains undigested in the intestinal tract; retains fluid; and ferments in the colon, producing gas, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. Although it can cause digestive disruption and discomfort, lactose intolerance will not produce dangerous results, and can be easily controlled through careful diet. Oddly enough, hardly any adults in the world can digest milk sugar after the age of 20. The exceptions are most Caucasians of northern European origin. The following infections can result in lactose intolerance: irritable bowel syndrome, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Although less common, in infants and children it can occur after a severe attack of gastroenteritis, which injures the intestinal wall. If you are pregnant and there is lactose intolerance in your family, plan to breast-feed your child or give him a non-dairy formula (such as soy milk). But, if you do, give him added calcium gluconate powder, since soy milk does not contain enough calcium. Lactose intolerance is different than milk allergy. A person with lactose intolerance cannot digest milk sugar; one with milk allergy can digest milk, but his immune system is antagonistic to one or more of its components.",

Although the disease begins at birth, symptoms generally do not appear until the age of six or more often in the teens or later. CAUSES—Wilson's disease is rare and inherited. The body is not able to metabolize the trace mineral copper, although it is still absorbed by the small intestine into the blood stream. The result is an excess of copper in the various organs (liver, kidneys, brain, and corneas of the eyes). If not cared for, Wilson's disease will result in serious damage to the liver and brain, and, ultimately, death. Early detection and treatment can minimize the damage. If you have a family history of this disease, have diagnostic tests made of you and your children. Early detection is important.

Other symptoms may include dry skin, fatigue, abdominal bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, PMS, thinning hair, tendency to bruise easily, depression, or inability to concentrate. There may also be vision problems (especially night vision; and bulky, pale, and fatty stools (known as steatorrhea). CAUSES—This appears to be a wastebasket category. Whenever nutrients, in general, cannot be properly absorbed by the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, the problem is dubbed \"malabsorption syndrome.\" Possible causes include an impoverished diet, primarily junk food. The body may not be producing enough digestive enzymes. Vitamin B complex may not be in the diet or is not being absorbed properly. Diseases of the gallbladder, liver and bile ducts, or pancreas may exist. There may be food allergies. Other causes include damaged intestinal walls, caused by irritable bowel syndrome; lactose intolerance; Crohn's disease; diverticulitis; celiac disease; colitis; parasitic infestation; excessive consumption of antacids, alcohol, or laxatives. Chronic constipation or diarrhea can have a similar result. Radiation therapy, sugary foods that shorten the intestinal tract, or digitalis treatment can reduce the absorptive area of the intestines. An overgrowth of candida in the digestive tract or obstructions in the lymphatic system can have a similar effect. Too rapid intestinal transit time causes nutrients to pass out of the body as waste. AIDS and cancer can produce many of these symptoms. There are a number of other possible causes, including a variety of drug medications. Premature aging can be caused by a decline in secretions of stomach acid and digestive enzymes.",

Urine often has a strong, unpleasant odor and may appear cloudy (from pus). A desire to urinate even after the bladder has been emptied. Children with this condition may experience a painful burning sensation when urinating. CAUSES—Cystitis is an infection of the urinary bladder. It is the most frequent bacterial infection in women. About 10-15% of them have recurrent bladder infections. The cause is generally bacteria which have ascended up from the urinary opening, but, less frequently, from infected urine sent down from the kidneys. The usual cause is ascended bacteria, and cystitis most often occurs in females. The urinary outlet of the urethra is close to the vagina. Ways to avoid cross infection between the two are given in the concluding paragraph of this article. Frequency, urgency, and burning urine are obvious symptoms of cystitis, but a home test can be also be done: Purchase \"Dipstick\" at a pharmacy and follow directions. A positive nitrate test will reveal the presence of a large quantity of white blood cells, indicating infection in the urinary tract. Women who frequently have bladder infections often have enlarged bladders from having tried to retain their urine. In order to maintain good urinary tract health, it is important to drink water and urinate frequently. In older men, the cause of the bladder problem might be kidney stones (which see). Blood in the urine could indicate a more serious problem. Consult a physician. (Also see \"Hematuria\"). Bladder infection in men may signal prostate trouble. Cyclamate (an artificial sweetener found in synthetic sugar) causes bladder tumors.",

CAUSES—Croup can be caused by bacteria or viruses. When caused by a bacteria, croup generally follows a cold or another mild respiratory infection. But when it is caused by a virus (as happens more often, especially in boys), more serious conditions, such as the flu, have occurred. Croup most often occurs during the winter months, and most frequently affects children from 3 months to 3 years (9 to 18 months is the peak).",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Difficult breathing, coughing, wheezing, tight chest. Attacks of multiple symptoms can occur suddenly or gradually. Sometimes there is coughing with thick, persistent sputum that may be clear or yellow. There is a feeling of suffocation. CAUSES—Asthma is a lung disease that results in blockage of the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles around the bronchi (which are the small passageways of the lungs) tighten and narrow, making it difficult for air to leave the lungs. The chronic inflammation and excessive sensitivity of the bronchi produce those constricting spasms. The bronchial tubes swell and become plugged with mucous. An attack, often occurring at night, usually begins as a nonproductive cough and wheezing, which is often followed by difficult breathing and a tight chest. After a few hours it subsides. But what causes an attack to come on? Only certain people have asthma, and those that do may have an attack triggered by an allergen or other irritant, such as chemicals, drugs, dust mites, feathers, food additives, pollutants, fumes, mold, animal dander, tobacco smoke, etc. But other things can also do it: anxiety, fear, laughing, stress, low blood sugar, adrenal disorders, temperature changes, extremes of dryness or humidity, or respiratory infections. About 80% have an allergic disorder, but the others do not. The experts warn that ever-increasing amounts of pollutants will cause the number of asthmatics to increase. Many workers must continually live with such things as sulfites, urethane, polyurethane, epoxy resins, dry cleaning chemicals, and many other chemicals common to industry. In the last decade alone, the number of asthmatics in America has increased by one third! Children under 16 and adults over 65 suffer the most from it. Asthmatics are frequently very sensitive to foods containing sulfite additives: potassium metabisulfite, sulfur dioxide, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, etc. Restaurants use them, to prevent discoloration in salads and other foods. Sulfites are also added to many other foods by the food industry. Nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide, and cigarette smoke are also known to precipitate asthma attacks. Fumes and strong odors, such as turpentine, paints, gasoline, perfumes, etc., disturb many asthmatics. There are two types of asthma: intrinsic and extrinsic. Extrinsic asthma usually begins in childhood, is seasonal, and is usually caused by a definite number of substances which can more easily be identified. Asthma is the leading cause of disease and disability in the 2-17 age group. Intrinsic asthma is the more severe, and generally begins after 30 years of age. Attacks can occur at any time, and the causes are much more difficult to identify. About half of asthmatics are diagnosed between 2 and 17, another third after 30. The other one sixth does not fit either the intrinsic or extrinsic category. For example, some may initiate the problem in their 20s and others may, after their 30s, develop reactions to only one or two seasonal allergens. But asthma can be difficult to diagnose, for its symptoms are similar to those of bronchitis, emphysema, and lung infections. Over a period of time, the attacks can become more frequent, so it is best for the person with asthma to learn every possible way to lessen the problem. Here are several suggestions:",

Keep the head cool by sponging with cool water or use a fan. - Pouring cold water on the back of the neck is useful. As the person bends over, the water is poured on the back of the neck from a container holding about a gallon of water. From about 24 inches above the neck, pour it for about 30-90 seconds. Do this 3 times a day during the critical phase. - A vaporizer, which blows cold, moist air is helpful during an attack. Menthol or eucalyptus oil may be added to the water. - After blending a clove of garlic in a cup of water, drink it. This may be vomited back out, loosening the phlegm. If vomited, give another cup. The garlic really helps. - Some take a cup of hot water, catnip tea, or mullein tea each hour. - At the first sign of an asthmatic attack, sit up straight in a chair for the first 10 minutes. Inhale through your nose and exhale through pursed lips. This helps press open the bronchial tubes. - Then lie on your stomach, with your head and chest over the edge of the bed. Cough gently for 2-3 minutes, to bring up the sputum. (But, during an attack, some cannot tolerate this position; instead, they lie face down on the bed with 2-3 pillows under their hips and a towel under their face.) - A neutral bath (94o-98o F.) is quieting to the nerves and helps relax them. - Lobelia is an herb that, when sipped slowly, relaxes the nerves and tends to stop the spasm. (If one drinks more quickly, it has a different effect, and induces vomiting.) - Mullein oil is a worthwhile remedy for bronchial congestion. The oil stops coughs because it unclogs bronchial tubes. When taken with water or fruit juice, the effect is even more rapid. - Other useful herb teas include juniper berries, echinacea, and, of course, that old standby, slippery elm bark.",

Do not use chocolate, fish, eggs, and other common allergenic foods. Avoid foods containing additives. - Avoid bananas and melons, especially if you are also sensitive to ragweed. - Do not use milk products. You may be allergic to wheat products. Do not eat ice cream or other cold liquids. Cold can shock the bronchial tubes into a spasm. - Research has revealed that a fat-free diet can help reduce asthma attacks. - Be sure and drink enough water. This vital fluid is greatly needed to keep your lungs and bronchi free of thickened phlegm. - Strictly adhere to the above diet. - Learn to play a wind instrument, harmonica, or sing. Practice deep breathing when you are out-of-doors. Have regular physical exercise. Hiking, swimming, etc. are good. You need to build up your lung capacity and utilization. This will strengthen your entire respiratory tract. A person at rest uses only 10% of his lung capacity; hard work increases it to about 50%. - Exhale forcefully through a small drinking straw into a large bottle of water. This forces the bronchial tubes to expand somewhat and become larger. - Some asthmatics have problems when they breathe too deeply. One way to minimize exercise-induced asthma is to wear a mask that retains heat and moisture and limits the effects of cold, dry air. - Spend a few minutes each day practicing standing tall, expanding your chest, and breathing deeply. Devise simple exercises (on the floor, against walls, etc.) which help you do this. - Move out to the country where the air is purer. - Practice breathing through your nose rather than your mouth. - Go on a juice fast, 3 days each month, of distilled water and lemon juice, to help clean out the body of toxins and mucous. - Reduce stress. Avoid worry and fear. - Get a good vacuum cleaner and get rid of the dust and dust mites in your bed, cushions, rugs, and floor. Avoid goose feathers (pillows and down coats). Dead cockroaches are also known to produce a dust which can bring on an attack. House plants may contain mold spores. Keep the bathroom clean of mold, also under the sinks. - Eliminate things from the house which harbor dust: carpets, venetian blinds, draperies, etc. Washable cotton curtains are all right. Avoid the use of electric fans; they stir up dust. - Practice \"sleep breathing.\" This is done by breathing slower and deeper than normal, with a three second pause at the top of the inspiration and at the end of the expiration. —Important: Also see \"Hay Fever\" and \"Allergies.\" HYDRO—Neutral Bath at bedtime, Hot Abdominal Pack, copious water drinking, Enema before retiring, graduated Cold Baths, Renal Douche.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Coughing and mucous, pain in the chest (and possibly back), fever, sore throat, and difficult breathing. Sudden chills and shaking may occur. CAUSES—The bronchial tubes are the airways which lead into the lungs. The bronchi are two main branches of the trachea. They divide into many smaller bronchi, like tree roots. These, in turn, divide off into the grape-like maze, called the lungs. Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi, and is frequently complicated by mucous obstruction of those passageways. When the bronchi are badly infected, the cause is often viral rather than bacterial. Irritating substances (or invading bacteria or viruses) cause the bronchi to produce an excess of mucous, which clogs the airways. There are two types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. The acute very often occurs as infection in throat moves on down toward the lungs. A cold or the flu, if not immediately given careful treatment, can spread into other areas, such as the bronchi or the eustachian tubes. If bronchitis is not carefully dealt with, the infection will move on into the lungs, resulting in pneumonia. Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing problem, which results from repeated bouts of acute bronchitis or from something that is frequently irritating the lungs. This can be allergies, especially tobacco smoke. The only ones who gain from tobacco are the manufacturers. Interestingly enough, only 9% of bronchitis patients in the U.S. are non-smokers. Infants exposed to cigarette smoke are far more likely to come down with bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis reduces the amount of oxygen to the lungs and the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled. This eventually can lead to enlargement of the heart; pulmonary hypertension; and finally, heart failure.",

The cough is at first not too productive, but later increasing amounts of phlegm are coughed up. The person loses weight and the sputum becomes bloody. CAUSES—In the 19th century, tuberculosis (TB) was called consumption, for the person seemed to waste away. It is caused by a highly contagious bacteria, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although it generally affects the lungs, it can attack any part of the body: kidneys, bones, skin, intestines, spleen, and liver. In adults, pleurisy is frequently a complication of tuberculosis. The sharp chest pain one may feel might be the pleurisy (which see) It is spread by coughing. Tiny droplets are inhaled by others. The germ enters the lungs and remains there. As long as the person maintains a healthy lifestyle, the body encapsulates the germs; that is, a tiny calcium shell is placed around the TB germ, to render it harmless. If the person continues to eat right, get enough calcium in his diet, obtain adequate rest, exercise out-ofdoors, and breathe vigorously to keep his lungs in good health—he will not develop TB, even though the germs are in his lungs.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—It is only with great effort that the person can exhale air from his lungs. There is continual breathlessness. Most any exertion brings coughing. It is hard to breathe in, but worse to breathe out. The neck veins often stand out from the effort, and he breathes through the mouth in order to try to get enough air in and out. Breathing is usually rapid and short. He may breathe 25-30 times a minute, and still not get enough air. Eventually his chest becomes barrel-shaped, his face ruddy, and he speaks with short, broken phrases. CAUSES—The word, \"emphysema,\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"to puff up with air.\" The walls of the lungs lose their elasticity, so air cannot be easily pushed in and out, as should normally happen. So there is air in the lungs, but it is not moving in and out. As emphysema progresses and there is more obstruction to airflow, the lungs enlarge with trapped air. The most frequent cause is smoking, but air pollution also receives some of the blame. Live in the country and do not have tobacco in your home, and you should be able to avoid this problem. Emphysema has become the most common modern lung infection in the Western world. Needing a continual exchange of air to survive, we use about a thousand cubic feet of air each day. It passes over lung surfaces which, if laid flat, would be as large as a tennis court. In emphysema, a large portion of the alveoli (the grape-like sacs where the air exchange occurs) are destroyed, and the blood is not properly aerated.",

Also avoid hair spray and other sprays. - Avoid allergens that you know of. - Maintain a program of regular exercise. Walking out-of-doors is always the best. Try using 1- or 2-pound hand weights and work the muscles in the neck, upper shoulders, and chest. Those with chronic emphysema need strong muscles there more than others do. - Eat less and a little more often. Prolonged digestion requires more oxygen and blood to the stomach, and away from other parts of the body which also need them. - Avoid gas-forming foods, such as legumes and cabbage. These cause abdominal distention which can interfere with breathing. - Sip warm, clear liquids in the morning (such as herb teas), to help clear mucous from the airways. - Excessively hot or cold foods may induce coughing. - Avoid hard-to-chew foods and maintain a low- salt diet. - Do not eat when emotionally upset or angry. - Drink enough water. The fluid intake is needed to keep the mucous, in the lungs, thin. - Maintain your ideal body weight. Some of those with this problem tend to put on weight and retain fluid. The closer you are to your ideal weight, the better for your lungs. Stay on a low-calorie diet. The thinner you are, the less flesh your lungs have to supply oxygen to. - Obesity and constipation decrease the patient's resistance to respiratory infection. - Keep your clothing loose; this helps you breathe better. - Learn to breathe correctly. The tendency is to breathe short and fast. But make yourself breathe steadily, from the diaphragm. Strengthen your respiration muscles by blowing out slowly through pursed lips for 30 minutes a day. Try to exhale twice as long as it took you to breathe in. - Learn to cough properly. Inhale slowly and deeply, exhale through pursed lips, and cough in short huffing bursts rather than vigorously. - Pace yourself in your work. Work steadily; it is not necessary to work fast. - When working, lift while you exhale through pursed lips; inhale while you rest. When climbing steps, climb while exhaling; inhale when you stop to rest. - Go through the day relaxed, not with a sense of alarm over your air problems. - Avoid contact with anyone with a respiratory infection. - Avoid drugs which suppress coughs. They dry up secretions, which you do not want. - Use only essential and unscented soaps. Avoid perfumes, gas stoves, carpeting, curtains and draperies which cannot easily be cleaned. Avoid hot, humid climates. Avoid furry, feathered animals in your home. - Get plenty of fresh air. Use a warm scarf or mask over the mouth and nose when outdoors in cold weather. Keep the body warm at all times. - Place 3, 4, or 5-inch blocks under the foot of the bed. This will help prevent mucous from accumulating in the lower part of the lungs during the night. (But not too steep, for that would be hard on the heart.)",

    "content_en": "The suggestions above are typical of what you will find in most books. It is difficult to find remedial solutions, but here is one: Several years ago, a Christian mother visited her neighbors, and met a woman with emphysema. It was a small, stuffy house and the lady smoked. So the mother went back home and eventually found a treatment; it was a wet heating pack from Kneipp's book, written nearly two centuries ago. She gave the treatment to the woman, who got well within several weeks. This was the treatment: - Place a plastic sheet on the bed, both above the bottom sheet and beneath the top sheet and covers. Dip another sheet in very cold water, and wring it out somewhat—quickly, to keep in the cold. - Work quickly: Wrap the sheet about the person, who is standing unclothed. The sheet covers everything but the head and perhaps part of the neck. Than wrap a dry blanket around him. The person immediately gets into the bed, and is covered well with the top sheet and blankets. This is essentially something like a heating pack, but done only with a wet sheet. The effect is immediate freezing cold, which the body gradually warms. The person can remain like this all night. In the years that followed, the mother mentioned the incident to a number of medical people and doctors, who were astounded; for everyone says there is no cure for emphysema. ENCOURAGEMENT—By both creation and redemption we are the Lord's property. We are required to obey His laws, but we are never asked to do it in our own strength. Christ helps us in all that we do.",

But then it develops into what seems more like pneumonia: a high fever (105o F.) with coughing, diarrhea, chills, disorientation, slow heart rate, dry cough, infection of the pleura, vomiting, severe chest pain, and shortness of breath. From lack of oxygen, the skin becomes bluish and sputum that is coughed up, eventually, is gray or blood-streaked. CAUSES—This is the strange disease which was first identified at the American Legion convention in 1976, which affected 182 partying in a hotel. Those who smoke, drink, have diabetes, emphysema, or kidney problems are more likely to contract the disease. Younger people quickly recover, but the elderly can die from respiratory failure. The Legionella pneumophila bacteria can be in heating and cooling systems. That is how the Legionnaires got it in that hotel.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—The pleural membranes become swollen and inflamed, and at first rub together with each breath, causing severe pain and sound that can be heard by a physician using his stethoscope. The pain becomes suddenly more severe if the person attempts to take a quick deep breath, to cough, or sneeze. Fluid may form in the space between the lung and the chest wall. When that happens, the rubbing sound disappears, as well as most, or all, of the pain. There may only be a little fluid or it may fill half the chest cavity, compressing the lung. Pleurisy can also appear on the surface of the diaphragm. In this case, the pain is in the abdomen, at the pit of the stomach, or can even be referred pain to the shoulder. In children, pleurisy pain and the pain of pneumonia are frequently located in the abdomen, and cause others to think there is acute indigestion or appendicitis. CAUSES—The lungs are enclosed within a sack-like covering. Since the lungs are constantly in motion, they must be able to slip against this covering without harming themselves or the pleura. Pleurisy occurs when this sack becomes inflamed. The cause is generally the tubercle bacillus (the cause of tuberculosis), pneumococcus, or streptococcus; the two later germs are present in pneumonia. Some pleurisy is always present in lobar pneumonia (see pneumonia); and, in adults, pleurisy is frequently a complication of tuberculosis (which see). But the underlying cause is not taking care of oneself: not eating right, not getting enough sleep, or not avoiding stress and overwork.",

It is typical that $1 per month in selenium supplement would prevent this disease and the need for a $250,000 procedure that carries a 20% mortality rate. This disease is also found in cystic fibrosis patients . . Veterinarians have eliminated this disease [cardiomyopathy] in animals with selenium injections and oral supplementation of diets.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—The wants of the soul, only the love of Christ can satisfy. If Christ is abiding in us, our hearts will be full of divine sympathy. We will do all we can to help and encourage others. Section 8 Cardiovascular Part 2 Circulatory ARTERIOSCLEROSIS (Hardening of the Arteries) and ATHEROSCLEROSIS (Plaque Development and Hardening) SYMPTOMS—Early warning symptoms are intermittent claudication (which see). These are pains in the legs and possibly feet, which leave upon resting. High blood pressure (see \"Hypertension\"). The later result is angina (chest pains) and heart attack. CAUSES—These are two separate, major diseases, yet we list them together because the problems, effects, and solutions are so similar. Arteriosclerosis is hardening of the walls of the arteries; atherosclerosis is the hardening of plaque on the walls, which causes the walls to harden. (The full explanation is somewhat more complicated.) Hardened walls produce higher blood pressure, but plaque-hardened and narrow vessels does it also. The end result of both is a heart attack. The main difference between the two is that arteriosclerosis is primarily the hardened walls themselves (which the plaque especially produced). Whereas atherosclerosis is the thickening of that plaque in the arteries, so that the space for the blood to flow through keeps narrowing. In arteriosclerosis, these deposits are primarily composed of calcium; in atherosclerosis, the deposits consist of fatty substances, primarily cholesterol (a blood protein). But, much of the time, an odd assortment of both, along with lipoproteins, fatty acids, fibrous scar tissue, and blood clump together. Both conditions have essentially the same effect on circulation, both cause hardening of the artery walls, both cause high blood pressure, and both eventually lead to one or more of the same things: angina (which is chest pain following exertion), heart attack (the heart muscle can no longer bear the lack of blood supply to it), and stroke (when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off). Death may or may not follow. The problem is that a clot of this plaque breaks loose, flows through the arteries, and gets stuck in a narrower artery. If this occurs in the heart muscle, angina and a heart attack may result; if in the brain, a stroke occurs. To complicate the matter further, not only can arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis cause high blood pressure, but high blood pressure intensifies them both. Causes include elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels, eating high cholesterol foods (such as meat, eggs, whole milk, or milk products). Other causes include smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, diabetes, emotional stress, lack of exercise, or a family history of the disease. Advancing age increases the risk factor. Pain in the legs (usually in the calf, but sometimes in the feet or elsewhere in the legs), which increase when walking but stops as soon as one rests, is intermittent claudication (which see). There may also be weakness, numbness, and a heavy feeling in the legs. This is a symptom of atherosclerosis in the limbs (peripheral atherosclerosis). There can also, but less often, be pain in the arms. There is a home test you can do to help determine if this is beginning to occur: Test the pulse in your legs and foot. There are three places where this can be done: Apply light pressure on the top of the foot, the inner hollow of the ankle, and in the hollow behind the knee. If you feel no pulse, then the artery may be narrowing. Atherosclerosis is the most common form of arterial disease in the U.S. and most frequently occurs in the lower limbs. It is the primary cause of death over the age of 65. Over 50% of the people between 65 and 70 will die of some form of this.",

    "title": "# Triglycerides, Lowering — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "PROBLEMS—The two major sources of fat in your bloodstream are cholesterol and triglycerides. Both are necessary. Cholesterol helps build strong cells, and triglycerides provide energy. But if either is too high, problems develop. High cholesterol levels clog arteries. High triglycerides cause vascular disease also, if they are associated with low levels of HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). You then have fat particles in your blood which can ultimately be bad for your heart. You can control your triglyceride level, and you want to keep it below 150. SOLUTIONS—Here are several ways to do it: Cut down on the amount of fat in your diet. Reduce total fat intake to less than 30% of daily calories; but, even better, reduce it to 20%. Reduce saturated fats to 10%. Eat a lot of complex carbohydrates. Races doing this do not have a triglyceride problem. Cook rice, beans, and other grains without including fat in the cooking or the serving. Do not eat candy, sweets, and sugar. Eating such simple carbohydrates in the diet are a significant factor in causing people to have high triglyceride levels. Put more fiber in the diet. A low fiber, high sweet, diet is even worse than high sweets alone. Lose weight. Even losing 10 pounds can reduce triglycerides in those who are 20-30% overweight. Ultimately, try to maintain a weight that is not over 5-10% above what is normal for your age-weight range. Do not drink alcohol; it decidedly increases triglycerides. Exercise is very helpful in lowering triglyceride levels. Studies reveal that it does this—even when weight is not lowered in the process. Go on a rice diet for a couple days. In 1944, Dr. Walter Kempner discovered that a rice diet would dramatically lower triglycerides. This is a diet of rice and fruit alone, and no other food, for 2-3 days or as long as you can stand to remain on it. The diet is not appetizing, but it really works. One patient went down from 1,000 mg/dl to 117 mg/dl in a couple months. In just 2-3 days, triglycerides will go down a fair amount. Then, later, you can do it again for another couple days. By the way, when you do this, you will lose a some weight also. The rice/fruit diet is practically fat-free. But do not remain on a rice diet! It does not provide adequate nutriments. ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not dwell on your difficulties, so they get bigger and bigger. Instead, think on the love of Christ and plead with Him for the help you need. Be trustful and obedient, and He will give you the best answers.",

    "title": "# Cholesterol, Reducing — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "PROBLEMS—Here are some facts about cholesterol, to help you understand the situation: Dietary cholesterol is in the food you eat. Most of it is found in eggs and meat. One egg has 275 mg, and an apple has none. Serum cholesterol is in your bloodstream. This is what your physician measures. Ideally, it should be under 200. There are two types of serum cholesterol: HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol cleans the arteries and is good for you. The higher it is, the better. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol clogs the arteries and is bad for you. The lower it is, the better. SOLUTIONS—Here are several ways to lower the amount of LDL cholesterol in your blood: Do not eat saturated fat. This is the kind in meat, butter, cheese, and hydrogenated oil—which is the worst kind of oil or fat, since it raises blood cholesterol the most. Only include polyunsaturated fat in your meals. It lowers blood cholesterol. This kind is only found in certain vegetable oils, such as corn oil, soy oil, wheat germ oil, and flaxseed oil. Only buy cold-pressed oil—never, never hydrogenated oil (even partially hydrogenated oil). Never put cottonseed oil into your body. The very best oils for your health are wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil. Prepare your meals without oil, fat, or grease. Then add a spoonful or two of wheat germ oil or flaxseed oil to the food after it has been dished onto your plate. In this way, you can carefully measure how much you get, and you ensure that the oil was not cooked. It is safe to use monounsaturated oils. These include olive oil and certain other foods, such as nuts, avocados, canola oil, and peanut oil. It now known that this also lowers blood cholesterol. Monounsaturated oils lower cholesterol faster than low-fat diets do, and the type they selectively lower is the bad LDL. Do not eat fried food, fatty food, meat, or vegetable loafs, etc. Do not eat processed or junk food. Do not eat regular peanut butter. The peanut oil has been taken out, and cheap, hydrogenated oils (sometimes lard) is put in its place. Only buy peanut butter from a health food store. You can open the lid and smell the difference. Learn how to smell good food. Do not eat corn chips, crackers, and other snack foods. Eggs contain a lot of cholesterol (275 mg per egg), yet studies reveal that, in most people, they do not appreciably raise cholesterol levels. Eat more fruit and beans. Both have pectin, which surrounds cholesterol and takes it out of the body. Pectin is in all kinds of beans and fruit. Carrots also help lower cholesterol, because of their pectin content. Cabbage, broccoli, and onions also have calcium pectate. Oat bran lowers cholesterol in the same way that pectin does it. Make oat bran muffins, and eat one or two every day. Oatmeal is also effective. You need 6 grams of soluble fiber every day. Corn and wheat bran are also useful. Fresh garlic lowers cholesterol, but not cooked or deodorized garlic. It is said that Kyolic may also lower cholesterol. Psyllium seed also lowers cholesterol. Exercise does it too. Vigorous exercise raise HDL and lowers LDL levels. Do not drink coffee, use tobacco, or drink. Avoid drugs of all kinds. Here are other things found to lower cholesterol: barley, spirulina, lemongrass oil, and activated charcoal. Vitamins C, E, and niacin also lower cholesterol, along with calcium. ENCOURAGEMENT—We are to love God not only with mind and heart, but with the strength also. We are to treat our bodies carefully, for we belong to God.",

    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Phlebitis: Reddening and cord-like swelling of the vein, increased pulse rate, slight fever, and pain accompanying movement of the afflicted area. Superficial thrombophlebitis: The affected vein can be felt and feels harder than normal veins. It may appear as a reddish line under the skin, possibly accompanied by pain, localized swelling, and tender to the touch. Deep thrombophlebitis: Pain, warmth, and swelling, with possible bluish discoloration of the skin of the limb it is in. Sometimes there is fever and chills. The pain frequently feels like a deep soreness that intensifies when standing or walking, and lessens when sitting or, especially, when the legs are elevated. Very often the deep vein in the thigh is involved. CAUSES—Phlebitis is the inflammation of a vein wall, usually occurs in the legs, and occurs more often in women than men. It can be a complication of varicose veins (which see). It can be caused by childbirth, infections resulting from injuries to the veins, and operations. Infections in the legs, feet, and toes must be given immediate attention (especially if a fungal origin is involved). There are two types of thrombophlebitis. The first is superficial thrombophlebitis, which affects a subcutaneous vein near the surface of the skin. This is generally not serious and many experience it. But if there is widespread vein involvement, the lymphatic vessels may also become inflamed, and fluids may collect. The superficial type can result from infection, lack of exercise, standing for long periods, infection, and intravenous drug use. Obesity, varicose veins, pregnancy, allergies, environmental chemicals, injury, and smoking can increase the risk. Deep thrombophlebitis, also known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is more serious. It affects muscular veins far below the surface, which are much larger, and can often come after confinement. The reduced blood flow can produce chronic venous insufficiency, evinced by pigmentation, skin rash, or ulceration. But sometimes there are no symptoms. The risk of DVT rapidly increases after the age of 40, and triples with the passing of each decade after it. Even though the person remains in bed until the swelling subsides, it will return slightly when he gets out of bed. Very little standing or exercise should be permitted while any swelling persists. If the opening in the vein, in the thigh, is narrowed too much by the phlebitis (and nearly always if it is entirely clogged), varicose veins will appear lower down on the leg. Blood Clots: Blood clots can be very dangerous. The origin of a clot is generally unknown. But it can form, following an injury to the inside lining of a blood vessel. This initiates clotting, which is part of the repair process. Blood platelets clump together to protect the injured area. Fibrogen arrives and entraps blood cells, plasma, and more platelets, which make a blood clot to protect the weakened wall. If a clot forms, it can break off and travel to a vital organ. Massage or rubbing may cause part of the clot to be dislodged and pass to other parts of the body, especially the lungs, causing serious damage or death. If there is any possibility that the person might have blood clots, he should not receive massage.",

CAUSES—The valves of the veins no longer function properly. They become stretched from excess pressure. The deep veins are surrounded by muscles which keep them in shape. But those close to the surface (saphenous veins) are ones which develop these problems. Contraceptive medications can induce varicose veins, as well as hormonal vasodilation just prior to menstruation. They can occur during pregnancy (especially during the first 3 months). Straining at the stool, because of the lack of dietary fiber, causes constipation and can result in varicose veins, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, phlebitis, and hiatus hernia.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—When a wound occurs, blood does not clot normally. Early warning signs of internal bleeding include a bubbling or tingling sensation or a feeling of warmth, tightness, or stiffness in the hemorrhaging area. Headache, confusion, drowsiness, or a blow to the head may indicate bleeding in the head. If your hemophiliac child cries for no apparent reason, refuses to walk, use his arm or leg, or seems to have a swelling or unusual bruising, go to an emergency room. CAUSES—Hemophilia is hereditary. It primarily affects males and is passed down through females (who are carriers). Children of carriers have a 50% chance of inheriting the defective gene. If they inherit it, the boys will be hemophiliacs, and the girls will be carriers. The sons of hemophiliacs will not give the problem to their sons, but the daughters will always be carriers. As many as two-thirds of all hemophiliacs, in America, have HIV. They contracted it from contaminated blood transfusion sources. About 450 babies are born with hemophilia each year. The blood of hemophiliacs does not clot properly, but minor bleeding is not serious. It is internal bleeding that can be fatal, if not treated. Bleeding frequently occurs in the knees, which causes painful swelling. Repeated swelling destroys the knee cartilage and results in a permanently stiff knee (called hemophiliac arthritis). Other joints can also be affected. Other body parts, including the brain, can also be affected by internal bleeding.",

It might last for days. The first sign is frequent flashes of light or tingling. There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cyanosis (blueness) of the fingers from lack of circulation and oxygen. The pain is most common in the temple, but may occur anywhere on the head, face, or neck. The pain is frequently on one side, but it may change to the opposite side, alternate sides, or be on both sides. CAUSES—These are caused by a disturbance in the blood circulation. There is alternating constriction and dilation of the blood vessels in the brain, and occurs between the ages of 10-30, more often in women (70%) than men. Food allergies are frequently the cause. Search them out. Here are six of the most common causes: food allergy, low blood sugar, tension, depression, water retention, and menstruation. There often are no migraines during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, or after menopause is past. Migraines can disappear for years and then reappear. They usually decrease after middle age. Over 50% of those with migraines report that one or both parents also had the problem.",

BELL'S PALSY (Facial Palsy) SYMPTOMS—Pain in the temples and/or neck. Only one side is generally affected. There is pain, weakness, and a sensation of pricking, tingling, or creeping on the skin. One side of the face can droop. CAUSES—Bell's palsy is a type of paralysis characterized by distortion of the face, due to a lesion of the facial nerve. It may be caused by injury, irritation of a sensory nerve, or nerve root. A decayed tooth may be the cause. Chilling of the face at night while one is sleeping can also produce it; the blood has been chilled back from the area. Sometimes Bell's palsy follows a respiratory infection. Bell's palsy is often mistaken for a stroke, because it comes on suddenly and results in numbness and partial, or total, loss of muscular control on the affected side. But it is not a stroke. Treated properly, there can be as much as 80% chance of significant recovery—all those with partial palsy and three fourths of those with complete palsy recover with no treatment of any kind. Because most of those with this problem recover spontaneously, they should not be given drugs or surgery. But severe taste impairment and/or reduced tearing of the eyes are bad signs, especially in older people. Bell's palsy can occur in anyone at any age, but most frequently occurs between 20 and 40, often in the summer months (especially August). The younger the person is the more likely he will have a full recovery.",

    "title": "Sciatica — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Pain is noted down the back of the thigh, the outer side of the calf and along the outer side of the foot, or on the top of the foot to the big toe. The person compensates by placing more weight on the other leg and foot. The pain is often worse at night and coughing, walking, heavy labor, or sneezing increases both the pain in the back and in the sciatic nerve. Still later, numbness may be felt when the hand is rubbed over the area where the pain is felt. Later still, a wasting of the muscles of the calf and a weakness in running and even walking may be noticed. CAUSES—The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve comes out of the spine and a branch runs down each leg, along the back of the thigh, down the inside of the leg, to the ankle. There are two primary causes of sciatica: The first is chilling the thigh over a lengthy period of time. The experts tell us that sciatica usually begins as a neuralgia of the sciatic nerve. If you sit on cold surfaces a lot (steel folding chairs in cool rooms, or steel tree chairs while hunting, or steel boat seats while fishing, etc.) for lengthy periods of time, you can irritate the sciatic nerve and produce sciatica. Fortunately, this form of sciatica is quite easy to solve: Apply neuralgia-type treatments, and only sit on warm surfaces or surfaces your body can heat relatively easily. Do not overlook chairs with foam that are too deep to easily warm up within a short time (say, 8 inches). On your favorite chairs, place a folded, wool blanket or a piled thinner blanket. That is something you can warm up. Experiment, and see what works best for you. If your body does not begin warming it up in a few minutes, lay something down that will. Unfortunately, there is a second, and much more serious, cause: The second cause of sciatica is damage to the lower spine. There may be a history of an accident, a fall, the lifting of a heavy weight, or a twist under some tension. Pain was first felt in the lower back. Later (weeks or even years later) pain begins to be felt at one or more places along the entire course of the sciatic nerve—back of the thigh, outer side of the calf, or in the top of the foot to the big toe. One of the cartilaginous plates (disks, also spelled discs) in the lumbar region of the lower back has been damaged. The cartilage bulges and later breaks, creating pressure backward against a nerve root. (It is also possible for a tumor to develop and press against the sciatic nerve, but this is far less likely.) Other important facts are these: (1) The person probably was not maintaining a nourishing diet, with supplemental calcium, and other bone-building factors. (2) He may have been overworking his body in running, weight-lifting, etc. (3) He was not lifting objects properly. (4) He was working at an occupation, such as lifting heavy patients in a nursing home, which is hazardous. In older people who do not obtain enough bone-building materials in their diet, degenerative problems can occur in newly formed spicules, or ridges, of bone. These may press on a nerve root. Some people derange their lower back by the simple method of always carrying a thick wallet in one pants back pocket.",

Pain is not always a prominent symptom of true neuritis, but the numbness, burning, tingling, crawling, with possible pain, tends to occur by spells. Weakness, and even paralysis and loss of sensation, are common. In serious cases, convulsions may occur. The affected muscles may shrink in size. CAUSES—The symptoms can vary with the cause, which can include an injury to a nerve, infection involving a nerve, or a disease (gout, diabetes, leukemia, etc.) Poisons breathed or swallowed (mercury, methyl alcohol, or lead) can cause nerve trouble. A lack of the vitamin B complex, especially thiamine in the diet. A degenerative illness can produce neuritis as a side effect. Men between the ages of 30 and 50 are the most likely to experience neuritis. Footdrop, due to sitting with knees crossed, occurs when ankle or foot muscles weaken, causing the toes to drag as one walks. Wrist-drop is caused by pressure in the armpit from a crutch or other support. Optic neuritis occurs when inflammation affects the optic nerve in the eye. This can produce gradual, or sudden, blurring and loss of vision. Blindness can occur in severe cases. But it is usually temporary if prompt treatment is given.",

    "content_en": "BUILDING UP THE NERVES—Good blood, healthy nerves, and strong bones and joints are needed for good health. Here are several suggestions, to help you strengthen your nerves. This is a building program: The vitamin B complex (100 mg per day; best taken as 50 mg twice a day) is especially important in maintaining good nerve action and response. Deficiencies of the B complex are common among people eating modern, devitalized, processed, and assorted junk foods. Take a good vitamin/mineral supplement at least twice a day. It should include all the B vitamins. Vitamin B , also called thiamine (100 mg, twice a day) is especially needed for neuritis. 1 Vitamin B (niacin, 50 mg twice a day). Do not take more than 100 mg of niacin a day. Niacinamide is 3 equivalent to niacin, and does not produce the flushed face which niacin does. Vitamin B (2,000 mcg, twice a day). 12 Vitamin B (250-500 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for carpal tunnel syndrome. 6 Folic acid (400-800 mcg, daily). Inositol (1000 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for diabetic neuropathy. In addition to the above B vitamins, also take Vitamin C with bioflavonoids (3,000-6,000 mg daily, when you have a nerve crisis). Vitamin E (400 IU, 2-3 times a day), especially with post-herpes syndrome. Vitamin A (5,000 IU, a day), but not over 10,000 IU a day if you are pregnant. It is best to take vitamin A supplementation in the form of beta-carotene. Minerals include calcium (400 mg, 2-3 times daily), magnesium (200 mg, 2-3 times a day), zinc (50-80 mg daily, not to exceed 100 mg daily from all supplements), and iodine. Essential fatty acids, obtained from 1-2 tbsp. of cold pressed oils daily. Never put it into your cooking; instead, put it on your food after the plate is served. Fresh and steamed vegetables are rich in minerals which are needed for the nervous system and brain. Brewer's yeast, kelp or dulse, lecithin, and wheat germ oil are very helpful. Eat regularly, chew slowly, and do not overeat. Octocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes. Increase your fluid intake. Obtain enough rest at night and avoid sexual enervation. Medical professionals know that such enervation is one of the quickest ways to produce weakened, degenerate, and diseased nerve tissue. A good balance between exercise and rest has a powerful effect in building the body, if a nutritious diet is maintained. Avoid stimulants and all processed, refined, and junk foods. Cool and cold water treatments will help tone and strengthen the nerves. The nervine herbs include skullcap, hop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, passion flower, lady's slipper, mistletoe, and small amounts of lobelia. Reviewing some of the nutrients needed, as they apply to the brain, we learn this: There is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is clogged, mental illness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in others. Eliminate the \"glue foods\"; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous and toxins in it, and lead to mental problems. Such foods include White flour, sugar, eggs, meat, peanuts, and dairy products. A high carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the brain, and produces a calming, peaceful feeling. Brain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients. Deficiencies of the B complex and vitamin C decrease the metabolic rate of the brain. Lack of niacin can produce deep depression, often seen in psychosis. Symptoms of a severe vitamin B deficiency are 6 headache, irritability, dizziness, extreme nervousness, and inability to concentrate. Pantothenic acid (another B vitamin) is needed to handle stressful situations. A thiamine deficiency results in a lack of energy, constant fatigue, loss of appetite, and irritability; if this continues too long, there are emotional upsets and overreaction to normal stress. Lack of vitamin C leads to irritability. Adequate calcium in the diet is vital. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for ways to maintain enough calcium in the body. Inadequate calcium results in insomnia, tenseness, and fatigue. Calcium and magnesium protect the nerves from damage. Too much copper in the body occurs in schizophrenia, and can be reduced by dietary intake of zinc and manganese. Vitamin C deficiency can cause copper retention which accumulates in the brain and liver. Vitamin B complex (especially B , B , B and folic acid) reduces excess estrogen from the liver and 3 6 12, prevents it from causing mental troubles. Many of the schizophrenias, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning disorders are caused by too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes. Plastic water pipes are the safest. A person with a magnesium deficiency tends to be uncooperative, withdraw, apathetic, or belligerent. It is vital to obtain enough oxygen, if you want a clear mind which functions properly. Vitamin E helps the brain obtain enough oxygen from the amount supplied to the lungs. A lack of thyroxine, the hormone from the thyroid, results in a slowing of physical and mental functions. Hyperthyroidism is related to emotional disturbance, forgetfulness, slow thought processes, and irritability. When the adrenals do not function properly, depression and other forms of mental illness may result. Exercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps rejuvenate the body and mind. Ginkgo biloba improves brain function and cerebral circulation, and enhances memory. ENCOURAGEMENT—We have been bought with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish. What a price has been paid for us! Now Christ invites you to come and accept the salvation which He alone can work out in your life. He can strengthen you to obey all that He asks of you.",

The winter months have shorter hours of daylight and more overcast skies during the daytime, resulting in less light entering the eyes. This light deficiency sends signals to the pineal, pituitary, and hypothalamus glands; and they do not function as fully as usual. There is often more stress and greater nutritional deficiencies in the winter. Less fresh fruit and vegetables may be available. All this combines, in some, to produce seasonal affective syndrome.

Crippling atrophy of the thumb can result. Symptoms are often worse at night or in the morning. The pain may eventually spread to the arm and shoulder. Symptoms normally affect only one hand, but may be present in both. CAUSES—Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a cumulative trauma disorder that develops over time, due to repeated stressful movements of the hands and wrist. It affects 23,000 workers a year. The median nerve in the wrist is compressed or damaged. This nerve controls the thumb muscles and sensation in the thumb, palm, and first three fingers. The median nerve passes through a very small opening, about a quarter inch below the top of the wrist. Either compression or injury to this nerve can cause problems: Pressure from the bone spurs inflammatory arthritis or tendonitis, swelling due to pregnancy or water retention. Other causes include repeated stressful motions, such as writing, typing, or hammering. Bookkeepers and checkout clerks can develop it; so can hairstylists, musicians, writers, drivers, athletes, restaurant servers, and jack hammer and chain-saw operators. The occurrence of CTS has greatly increased since the 1980s, when personal computers came into use. The tendons swell and compress the median nerve that runs to your hand, causing great pain. A common pattern is rapid and continuous use of the fingers, producing a repetitive wrist motion injury. Women between 29 and 62 experience CTS more often than anyone else. Raynaud's disease, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and menopause increase the risk of developing CTS. Other disorders, especially arthritis in the neck, have similar symptoms. But, if the first three fingers in one or both hands are affected by the pain, then it is probably CTS.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—There are several types of, what are called, seizures: Absence (petit mal): A blank stare lasting about half a minute, and the person is unaware of his surroundings. Most often in children. Complex partial (temporal lobe): A blank stare, random activity, and a chewing motion. No memory of this seizure afterward. An aura, or warning indication, may occur before. It may be a certain odor, sound, thought, etc. No after memory of the seizure. Myoclonuc: Brief but massive muscle jerks. Simple partial (Jacksonian): Jerking begins in the fingers and toes, and progresses throughout the body. The person remains conscious. Simple partial (sensory): Things that do not exist are seen, heard, or sensed. A general seizure may follow. CAUSES—Epilepsy is defined as an episodic disturbance of consciousness, during which generalized convulsions may occur. There are recurring seizures, generally one of seven patterns (listed above). This is caused by electrical disturbances, in the nerve cells, in a portion of the brain. Electroencephalographic studies reveal a direct relationship between changes in electrical brain potentials and the occurrence of seizures. Epilepsy is the most common form of seizures, also called convulsions or fits. Epilepsy can be caused by injury to the head, neck, or spinal cord, especially before or during birth. High fevers during early childhood or infectious diseases can also cause it. Heredity can be involved. Oxygen deprivation at birth or a later head injury may be causal factors. A variety of factors may trigger the onset of a seizure. Oddly enough, an important one is constipation in the transverse colon. Eating bread, especially soft bread, is known to lead to seizures. An improperly functioning ileocecal valve is a possible cause. This permits powerful toxins to enter the blood stream and affect the delicate nervous system and brain. During a seizure, the person may fall during the attack, often injuring himself; he may bite his tongue, pass urine, and awake to realize something has happened because of muscular soreness. There is a tendency to sleep following the attack. Sometimes attacks occur only during sleep. Some seizures take the form of antisocial or unnatural conduct. On recovery, amnesia is generally complete, so no effort is made to hide what happened. The epileptic may gradually deteriorate. IMMEDIATE TREATMENT—During the attack, arrange the head to facilitate breathing. Prevent the tongue from being bitten or from obstructing the windpipe. Place a pad between the teeth during the attack. Afterward allow him to sleep. Comments from a reader: I am writing in regards to your section on Epilepsy, under which you have stated: \"During the attack, arrange the head to facilitate breathing. Prevent the tongue from being bitten or from obstructing the windpipe. Place a pad between the teeth during the attack. Afterward allow him to sleep.\" Although a common belief is that a person can swallow his/her tongue during a seizure, or that the tongue can obstruct the windpipe, this is not true. During a seizure, the afflicted person's body will stiffen and convulse - resulting in biting of the tongue. It is therefore not advised that anything be placed in the person's mouth, as that may cause further damage, but instead to place the person on his/her side. Additionally, if by \"arrange the head\" you were referring to turning the person onto his/her side, I would ask that you please clarify as it is currently vague and unclear. First Aid instructions from the Epilepsy Foundation are listed below. I do hope you can update this information so viewers will not be misinformed. -Keep calm and reassure other people who may be nearby. -Don't hold the person down or try to stop his movements. -Time the seizure with your watch. -Clear the area around the person of anything hard or sharp. -Loosen ties or anything around the neck that may make breathing difficult. -Put something flat and soft, like a folded jacket, under the head. -Turn him or her gently onto one side. This will help keep the airway clear. Do not try to force the mouth open with any hard implement or with fingers. It is not true that a person having a seizure can swallow his tongue. Efforts to hold the tongue down can injure teeth or jaw. -Don't attempt artificial respiration except in the unlikely event that a person does not start breathing again after the seizure has stopped. -Stay with the person until the seizure ends naturally. -Be friendly and reassuring as consciousness returns. -Offer to call a taxi, friend or relative to help the person get home if he seems confused or unable to get home by himself. Thank you for your time and cooperation. Sincerely, Debbie Fiore See \"Convulsions\" for more information on dealing with them. PREVENTING SEIZURES—Do not eat soft bread; better yet, do not eat any bread. You may find that you should not eat mush either. Keep the colon clean. Take enemas or colonics weekly if necessary. Pressure from a clogged colon can press against the ileocecal valve and release toxins which are absorbed by the bloodstream. If the bowels do not move each day, take a lemon enema (juice of 2 lemons in 2 quarts water) before going to bed that night. Drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices. Include raw vegetables in your diet. Check your diet with pulse and other tests, to see which foods are a problem. Use rotation diets to this objective. (See \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\") Avoid white sugar and white-flour products. Avoid fried foods, animal protein, and artificial sweeteners. Maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Do not overeat! Do not take in excess amounts of food or fluid at one time. Take manganese supplementation. A lack of it can produce epilepsy. Women who lack it can give birth to epileptic children. Vitamin B deficiency has been linked as a factor in some cases of epilepsy. When given to some 6 babies, in their formula, the epilepsy ceased. Deficiencies of vitamins A, D, folic …",

    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "WHAT IT IS—A tincture is an extract made from herbs by soaking them in alcohol. (Only grain alcohol should be used for internal use; wood alcohol, such as rubbing alcohol, will cause blindness.) The resultant mixture does not spoil. Then when a spasm occurs, only a very small amount is given to the person, and he generally pulls out of the crisis quickly. Antispasmodic tincture is used for all spasms or attacks such as those of the heart, asthma, cough, epilepsy, or shock. HOW TO PREPARE IT—This formula has been used, for decades by veteran naturopaths, with great success. Here is the formula: One-half ounce cayenne pepper and 1 ounce of each of the following herbs: skullcap, skunk cabbage root or seed, gum myrrh, lobelia seed (or the plant if the seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root. Mix each of the above together while dry and put into a large-mouth jar. Add 1 pint pure grain alcohol of 70-100 proof. Eighty proof Vodka works fine because it is tasteless. (An alternative to alcohol is to, instead, use 1 pint of apple cider vinegar. Store in the same manner.) Let this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shake well, daily. At the end of that time, strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all you can. Store it in a tightly capped bottle. Also put some into a small dropper bottle. In a crisis, it is given in 8-10 drop doses. It can be squirted into the mouth or taken in a tbsp. of water. (If stored in vinegar, give in teaspoonful doses, not drops. Its effects are not quite as rapid.) As a cough syrup for children, prepare it in this way: Pour 1 quart water over the herbs. Let it stand for 1 hour, then strain. Add 1 pint honey. Place it over low heat and let it evaporate to the equivalent of 3 cupfuls. Pour this hot syrup into hot baby-food jars and seal for future use. Give it in teaspoonful doses for cough, asthma, convulsions, or insomnia. Jethro Kloss mentions a man who was released from clenched lockjaw by a small application of antispasmodic tincture. When the case is severe, especially with an infant, the tincture can be rubbed onto the chest, neck, and between the shoulders. Place 2-3 drops in the mouth, and wash down with teaspoon doses of warm water while the person is kept in bed. If necessary, repeat every 1-2 hours. There are six herbs in the formula. The lobelia is the active agent in relaxing the muscles and normalizing breathing. The cayenne pepper warms, stimulates, and reduces inflammation. The skullcap and valerian soothe the nerves and keep small vessels from rupturing. The skunk cabbage and gum myrrh aids in reducing infection. ENCOURAGEMENT—Our Lord is pleading for us in the presence of the Father at the throne of grace in heaven. He is our only hope. Our faith looks up to Him, grasps Him as the One able to save to the uttermost, and we are accepted by the Father. Section 9 Nervous-Mental Part 4 Paralysis LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE—1 (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) SYMPTOMS—Progressive muscular weakness and atrophy, weakened respiratory muscles (which can result in pneumonia), difficulty chewing and swallowing, stiffness, cramping, and involuntary quivering of small muscles. CAUSES—Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease, resulting in muscular atrophy. Causes include heredity (10% of the cases) or strenuous physical work in one's occupation, combined with nutritional deficiencies (especially vitamins B complex, E, F, and C). Other factors include viral infections, physical exhaustion, and trauma. Heavy metals, ingested or inhaled, can induce damage to the nervous system.",

    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Symptoms vary considerably, but usually include a sore throat, fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting. Children and adults can become critically ill in 6-24 hours after the first appearance of the symptoms. This condition requires rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Take him to the emergency room immediately! Demand immediate help! Symptoms include sore throat, red or purple skin rash, fever, chills, malaise, headaches, vomiting, sensitivity to light, nausea, delirium, stiff neck, and convulsions. In infants: vomiting, fever, difficult feeding, irritability, a high-pitched cry, a bulging fontanel (soft spot on top of the head). Changes in temperament and extreme sleepiness indicate dangerous changes in cerebrospinal fluid. Warning: A child can be hurt when he is picked up. CAUSES—Meningitis is an inflammation of the two membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. They are called the meninges. In addition, the thin membranes that cover the spinal cord may also be infected. It is a contagious disease. Causes include several different viruses (including those causing polio, measles, rubella, fungi, yeast infection) and several types of bacteria. Infection can spread from the nose and throat to the meninges. A depleted immune system (along with nose and throat trouble) can cause it to enter the blood stream and go to the brain. If not treated properly, a case of flu or ear, nose, and throat infections can develop into meningitis. Eating heavy meals or taking drugs while sick can cause an infection to drive deeper into the system and enter the brain area. Other factors aiding in the development of meningitis are alcoholism, brain surgery, brain cancer, exposure to chemical agents, head injury, pneumonia, Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, or anything that weakens the immune system (chemotherapy, radiation treatment, steroid therapy, HIV infection, and certain types of cancer). Of the three main types of meningitis, viral infection is more common and produces milder symptoms, such as malaise and headache, which generally clears up on its own in a week or two. But the bacterial type requires prompt, aggressive treatment—or brain damage or death can result. (Any time a bacterial infection occurs [such as strep throat or an ear infection], eliminate it; do not ignore the problem.) Fungal meningitis progresses more slowly, but also requires medical care. Do not guess! Call a physician! Meningitis is more common in children than adults.",

Later stages: difficulty in walking, a staggering gait. Later still: spastic movements, paralysis, extreme fatigue, and bowel and bladder incontinence. Symptoms flare up, and then nearly disappear for a time. Yet the problem keeps worsening, over a matter of weeks, but sometimes slowly over decades. CAUSES—Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The nerves are covered with a coating called myelin. MS destroys this covering, leaving scar tissue (called plaques) in its place. Eventually the nerves themselves become sclerotic (hardened) and stop functioning. Possible causes include an autoimmune attacking by the white blood cells of the myelin sheaths; malnutrition or poor diet; stress; possible food allergies (dairy products or gluten); metal poisoning (lead, mercury, etc.); chemicals (industrial chemicals, pesticides, etc.); toxins from bacteria and fungi in the body; and vaccinations. Diet appears to be a primary factor: heavy consumption of meat, sugar, refined grains, and rancid oils. Overwork, emotional stress, fatigue, pregnancy, acute respiratory infections, chemical poisoning, and poor diet are known to precede the onset. MS usually begins between 25 and 40, and twice as often in women as men. There is no known cure, but suggestions, below, will help retard (and possible halt) the progress of the disorder.",

CAUSES—Muscular dystrophy (MD) produces a weakening and wasting of muscle tissue which is not noticed (because of replacement of muscle tissue with fat and fibrous scar tissue) until there is substantial damage. Animals given a vitamin E deficient diet develop muscular dystrophy. It is believed that MD could be wiped out if vitamin E was given to all expectant mothers and bottle-fed babies. Mother's milk has six times as much vitamin E as cow's milk, and almost twice as much selenium. There may a hereditary factor, but diet is still the crucial issue.",

The onset is gradual, and the symptoms are worse in the evening. The person complains of difficulty in chewing, swallowing, and talking. CAUSES—Myasthenia gravis is a disease characterized by great muscular weakness (without atrophy) and progressive fatigability. The name means \"muscle weakness.\" Adolescents and young adults, especially women, are the most likely to have this problem. But it sometimes occurs in newborn infants and adults over 40. In the latter case, a tumor in the thymus is involved. It rarely occurs past 50. The muscles of the face and neck are primarily involved, but those in the trunk and extremities may also be involved. Some cases are mild; others are rapidly fatal. When the respiratory system is involved, death is much more likely to result from this disease. Progress of the disorder is variable, and prolonged remission may occur. It is thought to be an autoimmune disease that causes malfunctioning of the enzyme, acetylcholine, which is responsible for inducing muscles to contract. (It is conjectured that there may also be an excess of cholinesterase at the myoneural junction in which the nerve impulses fail to induce normal muscle contractions, but this is less likely.) There is a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. Either the acetylcholine release is not adequate or the muscle response to the acetylcholine is not sufficient. An autoimmune factor may be involved (i.e., there are so many toxins in the body, that the system interferes with normal functions.) Autointoxication may thus be a primary cause. Toxins accumulate in the bloodstream from chemicals, chronic constipation, etc. Either they destroy the muscular system or they trigger other body systems to do so. Chronic constipation can cause the cecum to press against the ileocecal valve, releasing poisons of the colon back into the small intestine. This is a dangerous situation, since toxins in the small intestine are absorbed into the blood far more quickly than when they are in the colon.",

There are only two classes of people who contract kuru: (1) cannibals, particularly in the central New Guinea highlands and (2) those who submit to transplant surgery. Research reveals that brain tissue from infected people produces the disease when inoculated into primates in the laboratory.

    "content_en": "IMPROVING YOUR MEMORY—Here are several suggestions to try to remember: The attitude toward remembering is important. As we get older, it is easier to become lazy about trying to learn. Pay attention to what you want to remember. Sometimes we are too busy or indolent to really give our attention to what we need to remember. An outstanding way to remember something is to say it out aloud to yourself. When you do this, you both speak it and hear it. If it is written down and you do this—you see it, speak it, and hear it. An equally outstanding way to memorize something (or teach it to children) is to say it over several times. Saying it, speaking it, hearing it, and repetition, are powerful ways to learn math tables and other things. Here are more suggestions: Categorize the items you want to remember. List what you need to remember under their logical categories, and you will be more likely to remember the main points and the subsidiary ones. When you set your glasses down on a table where you do not usually place them, take a good look at them and think about what you have done. As you walk away from your car in a mall parking lot, say out loud, to yourself, aspects of the location, so you can return to it. When trying to remember someone's name, take a good look at their face as you think of, or speak, their name. When trying to remember numbers, put them into units or chunks. It is harder to remember 6-8-7-2-5-09 than it is to recall 687-2509. If you are trying to memorize a new word or how to spell it, learn the meaning of the word and make it part of your everyday vocabulary. Or write it down several times. Associate a new word or name with a similar word or an object. Select the most important things to remember, and skip the rest. Quiz yourself on what you are supposed to remember before you come to the time when you have to use that knowledge. Avoid stress. When you are under tension or in a time schedule, it is harder to remember things. Of course, you can also jot down lists on paper. Some people quickly write notes on the palm of their hand. And, of course, make sure you are eating a good diet, skipping the junk food, getting fresh air, exercise every day, and getting enough rest at night. In addition, there are also nutrition and lifestyle factors which will affect your memory. See \"Nerves, Strengthening.\" —Also see \"Memory Problems.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—How much should those rejoice who are the objects of such amazing love! Christ loved you, or He would not have died to forgive your sins and enable you to obey His Father's law. Accept the great salvation, and rejoice that your name is written in heaven. MEMORY PROBLEMS (Forgetfulness) SYMPTOMS—You find you are forgetting too many things. CAUSES—People fear memory problems, because it might indicate the onset of Alzheimer's disease (which see). Alzheimer's generally begins gradually in the mid-40s, and is fairly common among many older people; so folk have reason to be concerned. But two facts stand out: Some memory loss does not have to mean Alzheimer's; it is possible to keep the mind in good shape, even into advanced age. Alcoholism, aging, candidiasis, stress, allergies, thyroid problems, hypoglycemia, diabetes, and poor circulation are factors in memory loss. Others are cited below.",

This produces depression, agitation, withdrawal, insomnia, irritability, memory loss, personality changes, severe mood swings, and senility. An intriguing early warning sign has been discovered at the San Diego Medical Center: As much as 2 years before mental decline, those with Alzheimer's begin to lose their sense of smell. The rate at which the ability to distinguish strong odors diminishes is an indicator of how rapidly an individual will lose mental functioning. (But smokers have already lost part of this sense, so the diagnostic test does not work as well when applied to them.) CAUSES—Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration. Memory and thought processes are weakened and disoriented. Nerve fibers, leading into, and out of, the hippocampus in the brain become tangled and short circuited. As a result, information is no longer carried to, and from, the brain. New memories cannot be gained, and old memories cannot be retrieved. In addition, plaques of a certain protein (beta-amyloid) build up in the brain, damaging nerve cells. One form of Alzheimer's occurs between 36 and 45, and is quite rapid. The more gradual form develops in those who are 65 or 70. Simple forgetfulness is not Alzheimer's. If you do not remember your wife's name, that is forgetfulness; if you forget you have a wife, that is dementia (of which Alzheimer's is a form). There are other disorders which produce similar symptoms: Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which slowly reduces blood flow to the brain; a series of minor strokes; hypothyroidism; advanced syphilis. Many elderly people are taking 8 or 10 medicinal drugs. This drugging will surely affect the brain. You can see the effects in nursing homes across the continent. Add to this a devitalized diet of fried, processed, and junk food. Other causes include heavy metals in the body. One in particular stands out: When you hear the words, \"Alzheimer's disease,\" think of it as \"aluminum disease,\" for this is what it often is. Autopsies on persons who died with Alzheimer's reveal accumulations of up to 4 times the normal amount of aluminum in the nerve cells of the brain. Significantly, especially high concentrations are in, and around, the hippocampus. (See \"Aluminum Poisoning\" for much more information.) But those with Alzheimer's also have high levels of mercury in their brain. Beware of amalgam dental fillings. Mercury from the fillings gradually passes into the body and, over a period of time, accumulates in the brain. Obtaining an adequate supply of minerals in the diet helps keep heavy metals from accumulating in the body. Women with Alzheimer's have lower estrogen levels than normal. Free radicals are another factor. Avoid foods which contain them. Those with Alzheimer's have low levels of vitamin B and zinc in their bodies. All the B complex 12 vitamins are important. Vitamins A and E, important antioxidant vitamins, are also important. Levels of choline and ethanolamine are lower in those with Alzheimer's. Undergo a trial of intensive nutritional therapy, especially B injections. This may ward off the 12 developing problem. Those with Alzheimer's tend to have a strong craving for sweets. But such a craving is frequently an indication of a food hunger for vitamins and minerals. Some people with Down's syndrome (which see) live to be in their 30s or 40s; they usually develop Alzheimer's.",

This causes them to exhale a lot of carbon dioxide, which in turn causes the blood to become somewhat alkaline. That results in the symptoms of a panic attack (which see). Episodes of hyperventilation can last for hours, but generally for only 20-30 minutes. But, for the one going through it, the experience can be quite difficult.",

    "title": "# Bones, Strengthening — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "PREVENTIVE MEASURES—You cannot succeed in life without good bones. The bones most likely to be damaged by lack of care includes the jawbone, teeth, spine, hip, legs, and joints—all very important. The objective is to achieve the highest possible bone mass before old age, and then to maintain it as long as possible. The following recommendations will help you fulfill these objectives: The body requires calcium for many things, although bones are the most obvious need. For example, there has to be a certain amount of calcium in the blood all the time. But when, for one reason or another, the intake of certain minerals is not adequate, calcium is reabsorbed out of the bones in order to supply other needs elsewhere. (One of these needs is providing calcium to a growing fetus during pregnancy.) The bones become porous and \"honeycombed,\" and so fragile that breaks can more easily occur. A major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb calcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of certain hormones. Obtaining enough nutrients, through diet and supplements, is important to maintaining strong bones. Calcium at 2,000 mg a day, magnesium at 1,000 mg per day, along with plant-derived colloidal minerals is needed. Digestive aids may be needed to help absorb this and other minerals. Especially important is sufficient acid in the stomach. Either betaine HCl (hydrochloric acid supplement) or lemon juice can be taken. Calcium and minerals are found abundantly in natural foods such as green leafy vegetables, carrot juice, and broccoli. The green leafy vegetables are generally the best sources. Along with them ranks sesame seeds. They are the best ratio of high calcium and low phosphorous of any food. A dietary calcium/phosphorous ratio of 2:1 is ideal, yet can only be attained by taking calcium supplements. Here are some samples of this ratio of calcium to phosphorous in several foods: grain 1:8; red meat - 1:12; organ meat (liver, kidney) - 1:44; fish - 1:12; carbonated drinks - 1:8. People who eat meat and/or drink various colas and sodas obtain an immense amount of phosphorous. Millet is rich in calcium and magnesium. Almonds are high in calcium. The grains, amaranth and quinoa, are rich in minerals. Fruitarians (people who only eat fruit) do not get enough calcium or the magnesium needed to help the calcium be utilized. Eat plenty of vegetables, raw and steamed. Other foods high in calcium include brown rice, kale, turnip greens, pinto beans, spirulina, collard greens, and sesame seeds. Those with dentures tend to find vegetables difficult to eat. This results in a magnesium and calcium deficiency. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw vegetable juices daily. Lack of hydrochloric acid can be a cause of poor calcium (and other mineral) absorption. Vitamin D is necessary (400-1,000 IU daily) for calcium absorption and repair. You need a basic 400 IU daily. Sunlight will help you get part of what you need. (It is estimated that, on the average, only 10% of our daily requirement comes from sunlight; so other sources are also needed.) People over 65 may need 800 units daily. In one study, the more sunlight that was obtained by the test group, the less likelihood of osteoporosis developing. But excess doses of vitamin D, taken repeatedly, caused bone deterioration. Potassium is needed for cell formation, and vitamin C is necessary for the maintenance and development of bones. Vitamin C is called \"cell cement\"; it not only fights infection, but also holds your body together! Garlic, onions, and eggs contain sulfur, which is needed for healthy bones. Manganese helps prevent osteoporosis (loss of bone mass). Rats on a low manganese diet developed porous bones. Vitamin A helps increase the rate of bone growth. It is needed for proper digestion and assimilation of nutrients. Vitamin B complex helps bone mass formation. B increases connective tissue strength in bones. 6 Vitamin K (found in alfalfa, greens, and other chlorophyll foods) is needed to help the body synthesize osteocalcin, a special protein matrix which attracts calcium to the bones. Folic acid works to prevent the formation of toxic homocysteine from the essential amino acid, methionine. The presence of homocysteine is involved in producing osteoporosis. (Alcohol, tobacco, and oral contraceptives increase folic acid deficiency.) Trace amounts of fluorides are also needed for bone development, but get it out of food—not from additives, fluoridated water, toothpaste, etc. The use of sodium fluoride, once thought to help treat osteoporosis, is now known to do the opposite. While it does increase bone mass in the spine, the bone is inferior in quality. Woman receiving the compound were three times more likely to fracture an arm, leg, or hip than if they took a placebo. As little as 16 mg of sodium fluoride a day produces abnormal bone marrow cells. Adequate natural fluoride is in all food and water sources. Calcium supplements include calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium citrate, and calcium gluconate. All of these dissolve well, so they are absorbed adequately. The mineral, calcium, has to be combined with another substance in order that it might be maintained in a stable compound (calcium lactate is calcium plus lactic acid). Calcium carbonate includes a somewhat higher percentage of elemental calcium than do the other forms, but all are beneficial. (Calcium carbonate not only has the highest amount of calcium per tablet, it is the least expensive form.) As with most other supplements, calcium in powder form is more economical than in tablets. It is important that there be sufficient acid in the stomach, in order to absorb the calcium and other minerals from the food. An increasing lack of this acid, with age, is part of the reason why older people do not absorb minerals as well and have poor bone structure. If …",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Body stiffness and pain in joints, especially during damp weather, in the morning, or after strenuous activity. There may be a sharp burning or grinding pain or it may feel like a toothache. There may be stiffness and/or pain when moving a joint. CAUSES—Arthritis is the inflammation of one or more joints. The word, \"arthritis,\" covers a number of disorders, some of which are covered in this present article, which deals the most completely with the problem. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (this article), rheumatoid arthritis (which see), gout (which see), and ankylosing spondylitis (which see). Other diseases which also infect the joints include lupus, Lyme disease (which see), psoriatic arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome (which see), and Reiter's syndrome. The various types of arthritis affect the synovial (movable) joints, which are the fingers, toes, wrists, elbows, hips, and knees. There are also joints between the bones of the spine. Each joint has cartilage covering over the end of the bone and is bathed continually in synovial fluid, in a capsule. Osteoarthritis: Cartilage is a smooth, soft, pearly tissue. Among other places, it is found on the ends of the long bones, and provides a smooth surface for the bones in the joints to slide against. As a result of years of wear and improper diet, this cartilage becomes pitted, thin, and may even disappear. There is pain and stiffness. Older people experience this most often, and it generally occurs in the weight-bearing joints (hips and knees). The connecting ligaments and muscles, which hold the joint together, become weaker. The joint may become deformed. There may be pain, but usually no swelling. Later, bony outgrowths may develop. Osteoarthritis rarely occurs before 40, but affects most people after 60. Sometimes it is so mild as to be unnoticed. Women have it three times as often as men. For information on rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, and gout, see their respective articles. Here is a brief comparative overview: In osteoarthritis, the cartilage at the end of bones wears down and produces rough, hard, edges of bone which cause trouble. This generally begins after 40, and 16 million in the U.S. have it. In rheumatoid arthritis (which see), the cartilage at the end of bones is destroyed, and is replaced with scar tissue. Then swelling occurs, and the joints may eventually fuse together. While osteoarthritis only affects individual joints, rheumatoid arthritis ultimately affects all synovial joints in a person's body. This problem usually begins between 25 and 50, and 3 million in the U.S. are afflicted with it. Gout (which see) produces extreme pain, usually starting in a big toe (or other smaller toe or finger joint). This generally does not begin until 40 or after, and 1.5 million experience it. Over 90% are men. The spondyloarthropathies affect the spine, causing pain, stiffness, joint fusion, and changes in posture. The most common is ankylosing spondylitis (which see). These difficulties generally start between 20 and 40, and afflict a total of 2.5 million. Men have it over twice often. Infectious arthritis is the result of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within a joint (most frequently bacteria or fungi, especially from candida [which see]). The infection can come from injury, surgery, or disease. There are body aches, chills, and fever, along with throbbing pain in the affected joint. The pain and infection may spread to other joints. It may strike at any age, and 100,000 in the U.S. have it. The following suggestions will help one deal with a variety of arthritic conditions:",

Swelling, stiffness, redness, and often crippling pain in joints, which eventually may fuse together. There is fatigue, anemia, weight loss, and fever. Affected joints sound like crinkling cellophane. In contrast, osteoarthritis joints sound like popping, clicking, or banging. Joints of the hands, elbows, knees, and ankles are most commonly involved. Upon awakening in the morning, there may be a joint stiffness which lasts an hour or longer. Swelling will occur in a specific finger or wrist joints, and also around the joints. Pain may, or may not, be present. The condition can worsen or remain the same for years, and later worsen again. CAUSES—Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory arthritis. It is an autoimmune disorder. So many acids, purines, etc., have collected in the joints; and the calcium supply has been so low for so long, that the body gets mixed up—and begins attacking the synovial membranes in the joints. Cartilage, nearby tissues, and even the bone surfaces are destroyed. This damaged area is then replaced with scar tissue, which tends to fuse together the joints—making them immovable. Oddly enough, this form of arthritis most commonly occurs between the ages of 35 and 45, but may occur at any age. It also occurs even in children. Two-thirds of the 3 million Americans who have RA are women. Among those under 18, 70,000 have it, most of them girls. Causes include poor nutrition, bacterial infection, and/or physical or emotional stress. Stress seems to be the active agent which initially brings it on. Exposure, overwork, or acute infections can also do it. Unlike osteoarthritis (which see), which only affects joints here or there, RA affects all the synovial joints in the body. In the first year after the disease appears, 75% improve without any treatment at all. Therefore natural treatments should help the situation even more. Keep in mind that 10% of those with RA become disfigured in one way or another. So this is a problem which is worth taking the time and effort to reduce or eliminate. The likelihood of remission is greater early in the course of the disease. Each attack seems to be worse than those preceding it.",

Short sweating procedures of any sort (Full Hot Baths, Steam Baths, etc.), followed by short and graduated cold applications, are the most important general measures. SWELLING OF JOINTS—Fomentation 3 times a day; and, during the intervals in between, apply Heating Compress wrung dry and well-protected by plastic; derivative measures. PAIN—Revulsive Fan Douche, other pain-relieving measures. STIFFNESS OF JOINTS—Fomentation 3 times a day, well-protected Heating Compress during intervals in-between; Alternate Articular Douche [alternate hot and cold spray to afflicted joints]; massage of joints and muscles; Prolonged Neutral Bath. DRY SKIN—Sweating Wet Sheet Pack, oil rubbing on skin, Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub, Wet Sheet Rub, Steam Bath, hot-air bath, electric-light bath [heating from electric lights or electric heater], sunbath. CONTRAINDICATIONS—Do not give very Cold Baths, especially Cold Full Baths. CHRONIC RHEUMATISM (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas) RHEUMATISM (CHRONIC) GENERAL CARE—The same as for \"Rheumatism, Acute,\" except that the local applications are made to the muscles instead of to the joints. Sweating baths, especially the Radiant Heat Bath and the Steam Bath; long Neutral Baths; Fomentation over painful parts, followed by the well-protected Heating Compress; water drinking; aseptic diet.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Sudden attack, often in the middle of the night, of extreme pain and swelling of a joint in the fingers or toes (usually the big toe). But it can affect the ankles, knees, hands, elbows, and wrists. Motion or pressure greatly increases the pain. After the swelling subsides, the skin tends to itch and peel. During attacks, there often is loss of appetite, stomach and intestinal problems, fever, and decreased urine output. CAUSES—Gout is an acute type of inflammatory arthritis, and occurs most often in people who are overweight or eat rich foods, such as meat, gravies, spices, and alcohol. The body cannot handle all the purines and other acids in the meat, and so these products settle in the body. Uric acid is the end-product of the breakdown of purine compounds. Gout typically attacks the smaller joints of the feet and hands, especially the big toe. Uric acid salts crystallize in the joint, and produce swelling, redness, and a sensation of heat and extreme pain. Unlike most forms of arthritis, gout affects men in 90% of the cases. It generally does not begin until after 35 years of age; peak age of onset is 45. Women who have it are generally post-menopausal.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Swelling, tenderness, and possible redness. A dull persistent ache that increases with movement. Immense pain in the affected area, which frequently limits motion. It most often occurs in shoulder joint and less often in the hip joint, in the elbows, or feet. CAUSES—Bursitis is the inflammation of the liquid-filled sac, called a bursa, found within joints, muscles, tendons, and bones. These sacs normally help muscular movement occur. Overstimulation of the bursa causes the synovial membrane to produce excess fluid. This distends the bursa, which causes the discomfort. Injury to the area is a common cause, but chilling of the area during the day, especially at night can also lead to it. Bursitis can also be caused by chronic overuse, calcium deposits in the bursa wall, reactions to certain foods or airborne allergies. In some instances, suddenly working tight muscles can do it; it is called a stretched muscle. According to where it is centered, bursitis has many names: housemaid's knee, tennis elbow, policeman's heel, frozen shoulder, or beat knee. The lowly bunion (caused by friction in tight shoes) is also a form of bursitis. A bursa sac on the joint of the big toe becomes inflamed. Athletes and older people are most likely to get bursitis, but it can happen to anyone at any age. What is the difference between bursitis and tendonitis (which see)? Both produce pain in the shoulder, etc. Bursitis generally exhibits a dull persistent ache that increases with movement. Tendonitis causes a sharp pain during movement, and is most likely to be caused to over-reaching for something. But it can also be caused by calcium deposits pressing against a tendon. There is no swelling and fluid accumulation, as with bursitis. See \"Tendonitis\" for more on that problem.",

Possible headache, toothaches, dizziness, pain and ringing in the ears, and pressure behind the eyes When eating or yawning, there is a clicking, grinding, and popping noise, and perhaps pain. There may be difficulty in opening and closing the jaws. CAUSES—The bite is misaligned, either as a cause of the jaw problem or as an effect. The cartilage disk that cushions the joint becomes damaged. This causes the bones of the temporomandibular joint to rub against one another instead of gliding smoothly past each other. If the tooth repair or replacements have not been done properly, this can be a factor in causing the problem. Stress, a poor bite, and bruxism are the most frequent causes. Some people develop the habit of clenching their teeth together during the day and/or at night. Called bruxism (which see), this is very hard on the joint in the jaw. An injury, poor dental work, osteoarthritis, bad posture, repeated or hard blows to the jaw or chin, whiplash, gum chewing, thumb sucking, chewing on only one side of the mouth, or holding the phone between the shoulder and jaw.",

There may, or may not, be a specific area of tenderness; pain, and aching will be felt in the front of the lower leg after, or during, activity. CAUSES—The experts are not clear as what shin splints are. They may be an irritation to the tendon which attaches the muscle to the bone. Or they may be a muscle irritation or the beginning of a stress fracture. Active people have shin splints. For example, 28% of long distance runners have them and 22% of aerobic dancers. They are caused by excessive walking, running, or jumping on a hard surface. But other factors include poor shoes, fallen arches, insufficient warm-up, poor posture, faulty walking and running techniques, or overstraining. Sometimes the early stages of stress fractures are thought to be shin splints or vice verse. But there is a difference: Stress fractures begin pinpoint pain, about the size of a dime or quarter, around or on a bony area. A shin splint is a generalized pain or aching discomfort up and down the whole shin. But, if the problem is not stopped, shin splints can develop into stress fractures.",

There may be twitching of the leg muscles or deep creeping or crawling sensations. Sometimes it feels like a pain, cramps, or aches. It tends to occur shortly after retiring at night or after sitting still for quite some time. Sometimes this happens several times a night. CAUSES—Restless leg syndrome is not a serious neurological disorder, and moving the legs or walking around a little terminates the sensation for a time. Women and older people have the syndrome more often than men, and a full 5% of the U.S. population have experienced it. Yet the cause is not certain. Mild weakness of the legs may be present. It seems to be related to iron deficiency, exposure to cold, stress, heredity, and motion sickness. It also seems to be related to pulmonary disease, stomach operations, diabetes, and uremia. Very likely, there is a circulatory factor involved: Blood circulation is impeded in the legs or blood is being drawn in excessive amounts, to care for a problem in the trunk.

    "content_en": "- Move your feet back and forth for a few moments. - Rotate the feet back and forth momentarily. - Get up and walk about for a couple minutes. This seems to work best at night, when you have been trying to sleep. - Change position in bed. It has been noted that some people experience the problem more often when they sleep in certain positions. - Some find using a heating pad helps; others do better by soaking their feet in cold water. LONGER-TERM CARE—It is known that drinking coffee is a significant factor, so stop using caffeine products. Stop smoking. Studies reveal it is also a factor. Some studies have shown folic acid and vitamin E to be helpful. There may be a relationship between this problem and iron deficiency. But be sure your iron is from food, not chemical supplements, or you can initiate other physical problems. It would be well to improve your general diet and take a multivitamin supplement daily. Do not eat much salt. Never eat big meals before bedtime. This draws the blood to the stomach, so that you do not rest well. It can also lead to a nighttime heart attack. Walk before going to bed. Better yet, walk outside in the fresh air. This will help you sleep better. Some sponge the legs with cold water. Others take a warm soaking bath before bedtime. Do not let your bare feet touch the cold floor afterward. You may wish to wear knee socks. Do not take sleeping drugs. They only add another problem to your life. Possibly massage your legs just before climbing into bed. Get plenty of rest. Reduce your overall stress level. Avoid prolonged exposure to the cold, which increases the need for additional healing blood to the legs. Avoid overusing the legs. Strenuous exercise seems to increase the problem. Avoid narrow, pointed, shoes and also high heels. Sluggish venous blood flow may be problem. Do not cross your legs; lie down every so often and rest your legs. See \"Varicose Veins\" for more information. ENCOURAGEMENT—All heaven unites in praising God. Let us learn the song of the angels now, that we may later sing it when we join their shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist, \"While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.\" MUSCLE CRAMPS (Muscle Pain, Leg Cramps; Charley Horse) SYMPTOMS—A pain in a body muscle, most often in the legs (especially the calf muscles) or feet. CAUSES—Muscle cramps may occur at any age. Between the ages of 15 to 80, a full 50% of people will, at some time, have pain or cramps in the legs. Leg pains in children are frequent enough that they are called \"growing pains.\" Reduced blood supply to the legs is part of the problem. Another is an imbalance in the levels of calcium and magnesium in the body or a deficiency of vitamin E. But other causes have also been noted: arthritis, anemia, tobacco usage, inactivity, poor circulation, too much or too little exercise, muscle injury, allergy, fibromyalgia, arteriosclerosis, dehydration, hypothyroidism, heat stroke, and varicose veins. Diuretic drugs for heart problems, or hypertension can also induce cramps. Those who have had part of the stomach removed tend to have muscle cramps thereafter. If cramping occurs when walking and stops when you cease, it may be impaired circulation and nothing more. If leg cramps occur during pregnancy, they may be caused by hormone changes, fatigue, uterine pressure, chilling, or muscle tenseness. A calcium deficiency can make the leg muscles trigger-happy; the contractions in the muscles are stronger. Leg cramps in older people may be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the circulatory system. Turn to the articles on heart and blood vessels, and see your physician. Vitamin E (600-800 IU daily) is very helpful.",

A femoral hernia occurs in the femoral muscle of the upper front leg. The weak spot slowly enlarges and becomes an opening. If in the abdomen, a loop of intestine can protrude from it at times. Unless corrected, such a condition will grow progressively worse. A strangulated hernia occurs when a loop of intestine is caught in it and becomes pinched, blocking the intestinal passage. Gangrene of the bowel, peritonitis, and death may result if a strangulated hernia is not given prompt surgical attention. A hernia in a child is less serious, and the opening may repair itself if the protruding bowel loop is pushed back and held in place by a firm band or adhesive strap for a few months.",

    "content_en": "BASIC CONSIDERATIONS—Surgical and puerperal asepsis, care to avoid exposures at menstrual periods, protection of feet and legs in damp and cold weather, proper clothing. INCREASE RESISTANCE—Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub 2-4 times a day, protecting pelvic viscera by simultaneous Hot Foot Pack or Hot Foot and Leg Pack or by hot water bottle to sacrum and Cold Compress over stomach area. COMBAT LOCAL INFLAMMATION—Hot Hip and Leg Pack 20 minutes every 2 hours; during intervals between, Cold Compress at 600 F. to area over stomach, pudenda and inner surfaces of thighs, with heat to feet and legs or ice bag over seat of pain; hot water bottles or Fomentations to feet, hips and thighs; hot and cold pelvic compress with ice bag over seat of pain, continue 20-40 minutes and repeat when needed; hot vaginal irrigation at 1100-1200 F., one gallon, every 4 hours. ENCOURAGE RESOLUTION—After the acute stage has passed, apply Alternate Compress for 30 minutes, 3 times a day; during interval, Heating Compresses, changing every 2 hours or as soon as wellwarmed; Graduated Baths for tonic purposes; alternate vaginal irrigation (1100, 800 to 700 F.); later, pelvic massage. PAIN—Fomentation or Revulsive Compress every 2-4 hours or oftener, if necessary. CONSTIPATION—Large Hot Enemas, twice a day, during acute pain and inflammation; later, graduated Cold Enema. CHILL—Anticipate chill by wrapping her in warm blankets with hot bags to trunk and limbs; hot water drinking. SEPTlC FEVER—Add to local measures, if fever is high, Hot Blanket Pack 10-15 minutes, followed by sweating Wet Sheet Pack, Prolonged Neutral Bath. If suppuration (pussing) occurs, surgical interference is generally indicated. CAUTIONS—Avoid Cold Baths; instead use partial cold applications, such as the Cold Mitten Friction and the Cold Towel Rub. —Also see \"Peritonitis—1.\" PELVIC CONGESTION (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas) BASIC APPLICATIONS—Graduated cold applications; hot vaginal irrigation, 10-15 minutes, twice daily; Hot Blanket Pack to legs with cold pelvic pack (Wet Sheet Pack over pelvic area), continued to sweating stage, followed by cold friction or Wet Sheet Rub. PAIN—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath at 950-970 F., for 15-20 minutes. LEUKORRHEA—In addition to the above measures, antiseptic vaginal irrigation. In certain cases, cool irrigation, at 750-650 F., produces better results than hot irrigation. Constipation and portal congestion must be relieved. Cervical catarrh and erosions often require the use of the curette [a spoonshaped scraping instrument for scraping foreign matter from a cavity]. ACUTE INFLAMMATION—If attacks of inflammation occur, rest in bed; Hot Hip or Leg Pack; hot and cold pelvic compress or hot and cold pelvic pack. PELVIC PAIN (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas) BASIC FACTORS—Remove all known causes: tight bands around the waist, tight shoes, cold extremities, sexual excess. GENERAL APPLICATIONS—Rest in a horizontal position, with proper general treatment for any existing general or local morbid condition, as anemia, neurasthenia, hysteria, enteroptosis, constipation, or any discoverable pelvic disease. If caused by neuralgia: Give hot Hip and Leg Pack or very hot Revulsive Sitz, 3 times a day; hot water bottle over seat of pain and heat to feet and legs. Very hot vaginal irrigation. If due to chronic congestion in a pelvic organ: Hot Hip and Leg Pack every 2-4 hours, with abdominal Heating Compress and heating leg packs during the interval between. If due to inflammation or acute congestion: Hot Hip and Leg Pack or Hot and Cold Pelvic Pack every 24 hours, followed by continuous heat to legs with cooling compress to lower abdomen, external genitals and inner surfaces of thighs. Vaginal irrigation at 1050 F. for 15 minutes, every 3 hours. Apply Ice Bag over seat of pain during the hot vaginal irrigation and Hot Hip and Leg Pack. Section 11 Endocrine Part 1 Adrenals HYPOGLYCEMIA (Low Blood Sugar) SYMPTOMS—Confusion, depression, nervousness, anxiety, antisocial behavior, emotional instability, exhaustion, headaches, impatience, inability to cope, fears, craving for sugar, faintness, dizziness. Symptoms especially occur a few hours after eating sweets or fats. The more that is eaten and the longer the span before the symptoms occur, the worse they are. CAUSES—The problem is adrenal exhaustion. The cause is too much stress, worry, and an excess of undigested sugars, starches, proteins, and dairy products. The cortin hormone is depleted, so food cannot be digested properly. People consume large quantities of sugars, caffeine, soft drinks, and alcohol. These all contain simple sugars, and insufficient amounts of complex carbohydrates. Add to this: high stress levels, and the two adrenal glands become exhausted. Hypoglycemia can be inherited, but more often it is brought on by an inadequate diet (and is then called functional hypoglycemia). However, there are several other physical problems which can weaken adrenal function and help bring on hypoglycemia. These include weaknesses in the thyroid, liver, kidneys, pituitary, and pancreas. Immune deficiency and candidiasis can also lead to it. Other causes include smoking and large amounts of caffeine. Hypoglycemia is sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as asthma, allergies, fatigue syndrome, stomach, intestinal, weight problems, or mental or nervous disorders. Half the people, over 50, who have hypoglycemia, are hypothyroid.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—The symptoms are first seen in very small children. Large amounts of thick mucous develops in the lungs, blocking lung passages and causing difficult breathing, chronic coughing and wheezing, and lung infections. There are digestive problems, inadequate absorption of fats, after-meal stomach pain, and thinness. Body sweat will have very large amounts of sodium, potassium, and chloride salts. Any, or all, of these symptoms may occur. CAUSES—In 1938, this physical problem was named \"cystic fibrosis\" because it was mistakenly thought that abnormal changes in the pancreas were true cysts (tiny pockets of fluid lined with normal tissue). But it was later discovered that those spots were just part of the shrinking process of the pancreas, as the disease worsened. There are three views of the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF): 1 - CF is an inherited disease, which the sufferer must learn to live with. 2 - CF is caused by inadequate absorption of selenium, zinc, essential fatty acids, and other minerals (including trace minerals) as a result of subclinical celiac disease. (Celiac disease is the inability to digest wheat and some other foods.) 3 - Dr. Joel Wallach, a veterinarian, who in 1978 was the first to diagnose CF in a laboratory animal, by noting characteristic CF changes in the pancreas and liver of baby monkeys, says he was fired when it was discovered that he could reproduce those CF changes in the body by giving or withholding the element, selenium. He had shown that CF was a nutritional problem which could be solved if caught early enough. (See Let's Play Doctor, J.D. Wallach, D.V.M., N.D., pp. 109-110. See order sheet.) \"The prevention of CF has been accomplished in pet, farm and laboratory animals by the veterinary profession by assuring adequate levels of selenium and essential fatty acid nutrition to the pregnant and nursing mother. This is not as easy as it sounds because of malabsorption problems (i.e., celiac disease and Crohn's disease) in a percentage of women. All things being normal, a supplementation of 200 mcg selenium per day and 5 gm of flaxseed oil, three times a day [to the pregnant and nursing mother], would be adequate to prevent CF. \"Treatment of CF is very basic: treat the infant as early as possible with selenium IM [given intramuscularly] at 10-25 mcg per day.\"—Op cit., p. 109. He adds that it is vital that it be determined if the infant is allergic to wheat, cow's milk or soy milk, so as to avoid what he is allergic to. We might conclude that all three theories are correct; in that, if you give the mother and infant proper supplementation, the disease can be eliminated at the beginning of the child's life. But if this is not done, he will thereafter not be able to absorb nutrients properly, will exhibit the symptoms of CF, and will have to cope with the problem the rest of his life. However, Wallach says that, even later, the person can lead a more normal life if he regularly receives essential fatty acids, intravenously, and selenium, intramuscularly. \"The lungs of CF patients are normal at birth and only develop bronchiectasis after chronic essential fatty acid and copper deficiencies have taken their toll.\"—Ibid. \"CF . . is preventable, 100% curable in the early stages, and can be far better managed in chronic cases than it is currently managed by `orthodox' medicine.\"—Op. cit., p. 108.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Diabetes insipidus: Extreme thirst and enormous quantities of urine, regardless of how much water is consumed. Diabetes mellitus - Type I: (insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes): Excessive hunger, thirst, urination, depression, weakness, blurred vision, dry mouth, and vomiting. Diabetes mellitus - Type II: (maturity-onset diabetes): Unusual thirst, frequent urination, general weakness, obesity, skin disorders, boils, blurred vision, and dry mouth. CAUSES—Diabetes is a major problem; entire books have been written on the subject. We can only touch on the subject here. Of the two types of diabetes, diabetes insipidus is the more rare and is caused by an inadequately functioning pituitary hormone (vasopressin) or kidneys which somehow cannot respond properly to it. Diabetes mellitus is the third largest killer in the U.S., and is caused by a defect in the production of insulin by the pancreas. Without insulin, the body cannot utilize glucose, which is an important blood sugar. A blood glucose level above 180 mg. percent causes excess sugar to spillover into the urine and make it sweet. (Mellitus means \"sweet.\") Diabetes comes from a Greek word for \"flow through,\" since diabetics produce so much urine. Some people can develop diabetes mellitus as a result of stress, obesity, or pregnancy. Certain medicinal drugs can also cause it: oral contraceptives, adrenal corticosteroids, phenytoin, or thiazide diuretics. A diet high in sugar and white flour can lead to diabetes. Parasites (especially in children) can also do it. Hypothyroidism can also cause it. It is of interest that people who eat much sugar eventually cannot taste it as well; so they pour on more sugar! But Type II diabetes sufferers also lack this sugar-tasting discernment. Leave off the sugar, and learn to enjoy the natural flavors in your food. Because the diabetic cannot utilize glucose for energy, he loses weight and is weakened by excess consumption of his protein and fat stores. Because of this, he may be very hungry and eat large amounts of food.",

CAUSES—Mono is a contagious disease, primarily affecting the spleen and lymphatic system. It can be transmitted by kissing, sexual contact, or sharing food or utensils. But it can also be spread through the air, breathing contaminated air exhaled by another. So it is not necessarily the \"kissing disease\" it is described to be. Most frequently contracted by children and teenagers, the incubation period is 10 days among children and 30-50 days among adults. The symptoms are very similar to those of the flu, but those of mononucleosis continue for 2-4 weeks! Even after the other symptoms are gone, a general fatigue can continue for 3-8 weeks more. Some people continue to feel fatigued for months or years. Individuals frequently say they felt sick but continued working, thinking they would shake it off—and then came down with mono. So if you feel like going to bed and getting well, do it before something worse happens to you. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or, more rarely, the cytomegalovirus (CMV), is the cause of this infection. Therefore it cannot be treated with antibiotics. Both EBV and CMV remain in the body throughout the rest of one's life; but the infection, carefully treated, generally seems to go away. Therefore, rest and care for yourself, so the outward symptoms will successfully go away!",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—There are over 150 symptoms linked to PMS, of which the most common include abdominal bloating, anxiety, acne, backache, breast swelling and tenderness, swollen feet, depression, cramps, food cravings, fainting spells, headaches, fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, nervousness, impatience, drastic mood swings, angry outbursts. Other symptoms include sluggishness, lethargy, delusions, indecisiveness, dizziness, constipation, hemorrhoids, skin eruptions, and migraines. CAUSES—PMS affects many women during the one to two weeks prior to the onset of menstruation. It affects one-third to one-half of all American women between the ages of 20 and 50. As many as 75% have the problem at one time or another. About 5% are incapacitated by it, and about a third report symptoms severe enough to interfere with their daily life. Bearing children or being married seems to increase the likelihood. The problem is a major cause of divorce. Hormonal imbalance is part of the PMS problem (see \"Menstrual Disorders\"). The liver regulates hormonal balance, by selectively filtering out of the blood and excreting unwanted excess hormones. One of these is estradiol, a type of estrogen which causes problems. If not eliminated, it can build up in the body. Part of the hormonal imbalance problem is that there is too much estrogen in the body and not enough progesterone. Fluid retention is the result. This affects the circulation and impedes oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain and female organs. Additional causative factors are mentioned below.",

    "title": "When Due To Inflammatory Disease Of Appendages—Hot Enema, Hot — Overview",
    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "Fomentations, Hot Pelvic Pack, Hot Blanket Pack. GENERAL METHOD—In addition to the local measures for relief of pain which have been indicated above, it is in most cases necessary to combat some general disorder to which the local disease may be, more or less, directly related. See \"Anemia,\" \"Neurasthenia,\" \"Hysteria.\" General tonic measures must be used between the menstrual periods. In chronic ovarian congestion, apply the stomach compress during the night; daily give a Revulsive Sitz Bath or Hot Pelvic Pack and the very hot vaginal irrigation, 1150-1200 F., for 15 minutes. In cases of deficient development, as in infantile uterus or nerve spasm of the uterine vessels, employ the Revulsive Sitz Bath, alternate genito-urinary douche, tonic sitz bath, pelvic and general massage. Surgical measures are often required for permanent relief, but a surprisingly large number of cases are resolvable without surgery; hence water therapies should be perseveringly tried before resorting to surgical procedures. —Also see \"Menstrual Disorders.\" MENOPAUSE (Climacteric, Change of Life) SYMPTOMS—Hot flashes, insomnia, disturbances in calcium metabolism, irritability, mental instability, dizziness, backaches, headaches, bladder problems, dryness and aging of the skin, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. Some have almost no symptoms at all. CAUSES—Menopause is the cessation of ovarian function, the stopping of the menstrual cycle, and the end of reproductive years. This is caused by glandular changes, and is a natural event in a woman's life; this usually occurs between 42 and 55. The average age is about 50, and the transition is generally up to 5 years. There tends to be a hormone starvation at that time, since menopause usually results from a decreased production of the female sex hormones. The lessened supply of estrogen increases the possibility of cardiovascular disease, vaginal atrophy, and osteoporosis. It is popular to take estrogen supplements, to prevent or postpone menopausal symptoms. But keep in mind that there is an increased risk of cancer when this is done. If estrogen (hormone replacement) therapy is begun, take vitamin E several hours earlier or later, not at the same time. In addition, generous amounts of vitamins B , C, folic acid, pantothenic acid, PABA, and B will make 6 12 the estrogen therapy more effective. Oral estrogens should not be accompanied by progesterone because they increase the cancer induction risk. Keep in mind that synthetic, not natural, estrogens are given in hormone replacement therapy. These tend to accumulate in the body, and also can cause metabolic changes in the liver. This can lead to high blood pressure, fluid retention, and blood clots. But natural estrogens are available; one is equine estrogen, and is extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. But it is very powerful, and may also cause changes in the liver. Do not use it if you are obese, smoke, or have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or varicose veins. The safest natural estrogens are estropipate (Ogen) and estradiol (Estrace, Emcyt, and Estraderm); these are all metabolized more easily by your body. Be sure and use the smallest possible dose, and take it only every other day. It is coming to be recognized that it is often more important to replace the lessened progesterone than the lessened estrogen. Natural progesterone creams (from the herb, wild yam) provide a simplified way to do this. Many, many, have been helped by doing this! When the menopause proceeds normally, the adrenals and liver increase their output of female hormones and make up the difference from the lost ovarian function. Proper diet, nutritional supplements, exercise, and adequate rest can minimize the effects of menopause. TREATMENT—Vitamin E (up to 1,200 IU daily) is especially important at this time. - Vitamin C, working with bioflavonoids, maintains capillary strength. - The B complex vitamins, especially pantothenic acid and PABA, relieve nervous irritability. - It is very important that sufficient calcium be taken, to maintain a proper calciumphosphorous balance. Not doing so can also result in a broken hip later. - An increase in protein and reduction in carbohydrates is recommended at this time. - Maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D, iron, and magnesium. - Eliminate all processed, refined, and junk foods. This includes white sugar and whiteflour products. - Raw fruit and vegetable juices, brewer's yeast, lecithin, kelp, and cold-pressed vegetable oils are needed. The diet should be at least 50% raw food. - Avoid animal products and dairy products. - Do not use alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, sugar, and hot soups and drinks. They make the emotional swings worse and the blood more acidic. This causes the bones to release extra calcium, to balance blood pH and weaken the bones if extra calcium is not taken. - Substitute garlic and onion powder for salt. Consuming salt increases urinary excretion of calcium. - Drink 2 quarts of water each day, to help prevent drying of skin and mucous membranes. - After menopause begins, you will not have as much calcium in your body, due to the lessened estrogen; it is important that you henceforth supplement with calcium. Of the 250,000 hip fractures that occur in the U.S. every year, 80% are due to osteoporosis. - Avoid mental and emotional stress and worry. Be happy with the blessings you have, and thank God for them. - Get plenty of outdoor exercise and sufficient rest. Lay down and rest a little before lunch and supper. A lack of exercise weakens bone density. - Especially important are vitamins E, C, A, and B complex, including PABA and pantothenic acid. - Hypothyroidism is common during menopause, and is responsible for a number of the symptoms. Be sure and take additional amounts of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp. - Helpful herbs include lady's mangle, motherwort, and St. John's wort. —Also see \"Menstrual Disorders\" for related information. …",

    "content_en": "HOW TO DO IT—A douche is especially helpful if one has a history of discharges or infection. Retention douches are especially effective, and are best done in a bathtub with the feet up on the sides, to aid in retaining the fluid for 10-15 minutes. Warm the douche to body temperature before taking. Possible douches include: 4-8 ounces of diluted vinegar to a pint of distilled water, 4-8 ounces of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 ounce of bayberry myrtle (myrica cerifera) to 1 pint water. A replant of lactobacillus acidophilus may be needed, to normalize flora after vaginitis or antibiotic drug medications. Plain, unsweetened yogurt (4 ounces) can be emptied into warm water (10-20 oz.). Routine douching is not necessary for personal hygiene. Douching is best reserved for therapy, in time of infection. Excessive douching may actually help promote infection. WARNING—Douching may induce pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In one study, almost 90% of the women with PID were vigorous douchers, often since the age of 16 or 17. Very likely, infected fluid is flushed up into the uterine cavity by the douche.

CAUSES—A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, and is done to remove fibroids (30% of the time), endometriosis (20%), or uterine prolapse (18%). There are three types of hysterectomies, each more complete than the preceding one: 1 - Partial hysterectomy: The uterus is removed, but the cervix and other female reproductive organs remain. 2 - Total hysterectomy: Both the uterus and cervix are removed. 3 - Panhysterectomy: The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are removed. There are problems which led to the decision to have a hysterectomy. These may include urinary tract problems, lengthy and heavy periods, a heavy and bloated feeling, abdominal swelling due to fibroids, infertility resulting from fibroids or endometriosis, or reactions to drugs given for endometriosis. But the problems resulting from a hysterectomy are, if anything, more significant: The hormones are suddenly stopped. This sends shock waves throughout the entire system. Lack of those hormones can result in immense bone mass loss, osteoporosis, and greater likelihood of heart disease, depression, urinary tract problems, dizziness, insomnia, headaches, and general fatigue. Even those women who do not have their ovaries cut out still experience a drastic lessening of estrogen output. In addition, menopause begins years earlier for half the women who are spared their ovaries. Depression may also occur, and reduced sexual desire frequently does. There is a 50% chance of a minor post-operative complication, such as fever, bleeding, or wound healing. One in a 1,000 die and 10% require a blood transfusion. It has been estimated that many of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in America each year are totally unnecessary. No foreign country has even half that per capita amount. Once the operation has been performed, you are permanently sterile, and it cannot be reversed. It is often recommended that the ovaries be taken out also, because they might later become cancerous. Yet statistics reveal that ovarian cancer is rare. It is frequently recommended that a hysterectomy be performed, to eliminate fibroids, since they might be malignant. But modern technology permits them to be examined, by ultrasound, for abnormalities. A myomectomy should be performed to remove problematic fibroids, not a hysterectomy. (Also see \"Fibroids.\") Women who have hysterectomies have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease. If you decide to have a hysterectomy, ask that a horizontal incision be made, not a vertical one. The scar will thus be less noticeable afterward.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—A variety of problems can occur during pregnancy—ranging from backache, constipation, stretch marks, and gas, to hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and miscarriage. INTRODUCTION—Pregnancy is that special 40-week period between conception and birth when the child grows and develops. A weight gain of 20-35 pounds is desirable and, in most cases, is in keeping with good health. But a number of problems can occur. Here are several of them. For more information, see \"Morning Sickness,\" \"Premature Labor,\" and \"Miscarriage.\" Many of the problems occurring during pregnancy are related to hormonal changes, nutritional needs, or various expansion pressures as the fetus continues to grow. NUTRITION—Proper nutrition is important. There is a 20% increase of blood volume during pregnancy. This requires additional complete protein. A healthy diet during this time would include 2 fruits a day, 7 vegetables (including salads, grains, and other worthwhile foods), etc. Complex carbohydrates, best obtained in whole grains, are important. Complete, vitamin/mineral supplementation is also important. Vitamin A protects the immune system and avoids eye abnormalities, cleft lip, and cleft palate. Do not let vitamin A intake go over 10,000 IU daily. Excessive intake of vitamin A is linked to cleft palate, heart defects, and other congenital defects. Foods rich in vitamin A may also cause problems. But foods with natural beta-carotene are not harmful. (This is because it is only converted to vitamin A as it is needed.) All the B complex is important. They help prevent leg, back, and joint pains in the mother during pregnancy. Vitamin B (thiamine) prevents stillbirths, low-birth weight babies, and heart disorders. In late 1 pregnancy and post-delivery, B requirements are greatly increased. 1 Vitamin B (riboflavin) prevents short limbs and cleft palate. 2 Vitamin B (niacin, niacinamide) prevents irritability, depression, disorientation, fatigue, nervousness, 3 and muscular weakness. Vitamin B (pyridoxine) prevents several fetal abnormalities, including seizures, cleft lip, and cleft 6 palate. Take 100 mg daily until birth, followed by only 50 mg daily. This is because an excess of B 6 after delivery can hinder the amount of mother's milk produced. Folic acid prevents anemia and birth defects. It is involved in cell growth and DNA production. But it is vital that this supplementation be started prior to conception. Take 400 mg daily. If there is not enough folic acid in the system during the first six weeks of pregnancy, spina bifida and anencephaly can result. But most women do not know they are pregnant until several weeks after conception has occurred. Therefore it is crucial that you be taking this vitamin regularly. Vitamin C prevents infections and small babies. Vitamin D works with calcium, to build strong bones. All the vitamins are very important, but so are the minerals. Magnesium helps prevent birth abnormalities and miscarriage. Calcium prevents weak bones and teeth, premature births, and damaged nerves. Although phosphorous is important you always get enough in your food. Too much blocks iron and calcium absorption. Soft drinks eliminate calcium. See \"Bones, Strengthening.\" The trace minerals are also important. Nova Scotia dulse and Norwegian kelp are good sources. Iodine prevents thyroid problems, abnormal development, and certain types of mental retardation. Zinc prevents dwarfism and limb defects. Manganese prevents certain brain abnormalities. Inadequate folic acid, manganese, and zinc (as well as amino acid imbalances) have been linked to mental retardation and deformities in the fetus. Do not eat junk food of any type. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, spicy, fried, or overly processed foods. If possible, avoid all drugs. SPECIAL NOTES—If at all possible, have your baby by natural childbirth—and with the help of a midwife. Be sure and breast-feed your baby for at least the first three months, and longer if possible. (see \"Breastfeeding.\") Do not use an electric blanket. Studies indicate it may increase risk of miscarriage and problems in development. Aspirin has been linked to fetal deformities, bleeding, and complications during pregnancy. Do not use cinnamon in large quantities during pregnancy. The drug, etretinate (Tegison), is prescribed for psoriasis, and can cause birth defects. Avoid the following herbs during pregnancy: feverfew, goldenseal, black cohosh, tansy, angelica, bloodroot, celandine, dong quai, Oregon grape, rue, cat's claw, barberry, cottonwood bark, and pennyroyal. Keep yourself healthy, so you can continue eating an adequate diet. Avoid long fasts, cleansing diets, or strictly limited diets during pregnancy and lactation (see \"Eclampsia\"). Do not take anything containing shark cartilage during pregnancy. It reduces production of new blood vessels. Do not take supplements containing phenylalanine. This is an amino acid which can alter brain growth in the fetus. The sweetener, Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet), contains high levels of phenylalanine. A drug prescribed for acne (isotretinoin, under the trade name of Accutane) can cause birth defects. Avoid mineral oil; it inhibits the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Two medications, used to control seizures, increase by four times the risk of producing a baby with heart defects. These drugs are phenobarbital and phenytoin (Dilantin). Drinking large quantities of coffee, cola drinks, or other caffeine sources can result in birth defects. Certain chemicals in drugs can stunt fetal growth. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and others); antacids (Pepto-Bismol, Alka-Seltzer, Rolaids, Tums, Di-Gel, Maalox, Gelusil); aspirin; cough remedies; cold pills; antihistamines; estrogens; and decongestants. INDIGESTION—Eat smaller meals and chew your food well. Acidophilus, peppermint tea, ginger, and aloe vera juice will help. Also see \"Indigestion.\" Do not take baking soda to alleviate indigestion, because the sodium content …",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Nausea and vomiting by the mother between the sixth and twelfth weeks of pregnancy. CAUSES—Although called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. Morning sickness is caused by rising progesterone levels, and is quite normal. Morning sickness is said to be a cleansing of the body, to prepare a clean environment in which the fetus can properly develop. But about 1 woman in 200 experiences an abnormal amount of vomiting and severe nausea. This can result in acidosis, malnutrition, dehydration, and significant weight loss. Possible causes of this abnormal condition include drug toxicity, vitamin deficiency (especially of B ), 6 pancreatitis, bile duct disease, inflammatory bowel disorders. It can also be caused by the production of high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, which is a hormone. Cysts in the uterus or multiple pregnancy can be the cause. Morning sickness generally does not continue beyond the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. If there is persistent vomiting or nausea later, consult with your health-care provider. At its worst, morning sickness can degenerate into hyperemesis gravidarum. In this situation, the motherto-be has far too much vomiting and nausea; is overly dehydrated; not urinating properly; and cannot keep food, water, and juice down for over a period of 4-6 hours. This condition can lead to pulse irregularities, electrolyte imbalance, and even kidney and liver damage. Ketones produced, when stored fat is broken down, can damage neurological development in the fetus. How to avoid this danger? Do not stop eating and drinking fluids, even though you feel nauseated and vomit.",

TO MAKE LABOR EASIER—Take training classes, to help you relax during contractions, to reduce pains, help train the coach to assist, and how to recognize potential problems. Helpful herbs include blue cohosh and corn ergot. TO STOP POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE—Raspberry tea can be used to stop post-partum hemorrhage. Give it either orally or intramuscularly). TO STOP AFTER-BIRTH PAINS—Wild yam, cramp bark, and black haw are specific herbs which help reduce after-birth pains and cramping throughout the pelvic area. Hot fomentations over the area, after a warming liniment has been rubbed into the skin, is useful. Warm whole baths help the pain subside. Make sure the bathtub is sterile beforehand. Fast on vegetable juices and broths until the pains are gone. Once the pain is relieved, apply a castor oil pack for an hour. ENCOURAGEMENT—Let God's Word, the Bible, be a lamp to your feet and a light to your path. In Him you can find the help you need. PRE-ECLAMPSIA; ECLAMPSIA (Pregnancy Toxemia) SYMPTOMS—Pre-eclampsia: Sudden weight gain, high blood pressure, albuminuria, headaches, dizziness, spots before the eyes, epigastric pain, edema (swelling) of the legs and feet. Eclampsia: Symptoms of pre-eclampsia, plus convulsions and coma. The convulsions begin with fixation of the eyeballs, rolling of the eyes, twitchings of the face, arms, and hands. Then coma with temperature at 103o-104o F. The person can die in the coma. CAUSES—Beginning about the turn of the century, physicians have sometimes prescribed women to keep their weight down in order to have smaller babies (which are easier for the doctor to deliver). But such arbitrarily restricted diets—low in protein, salt, and water—can lead to serious consequences. The sudden weight gain occurs because of fluid retention, due to low blood protein, high blood pressure, and albuminuria. If pre-eclampsia is not treated properly, then it develops into eclampsia—an even worse form of the disorder. Both forms of this disorder occur after the 20th week of pregnancy. The orthodox treatment is to place the woman in the hospital, wait until convulsions occur, and then give her barbiturates. But what she needs is nourishing food. Diet, blood pressure, and weight must be watched—but proper nutrition and fluid intake is most important.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—A variety of partially, or wholly, incapacitating physical or mental defects which are present at birth. CAUSES—More than 90% of birth defects are the result of preconception and early pregnancy malnutrition of the mother. Such defects include cleft palates, cleft lips, heart defects, limb defects, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart defects, brain defect, fetal hernia. All of the above diseases have been eliminated from valuable livestock by the veterinary profession. They have done this by giving the animals excellent nutrition. It is well-known that bearing a child after the age of 40 can cause problems. But teenagers have a greater percentage of children with birth defects than do women over 40, because of their general poor eating habits and lack of vitamin/mineral supplementation. Many young people today live on junk food and have damaged offspring as a result. As an example, let us consider cystic fibrosis; it is a type of adrenal damage). It is classified as the \"most common genetic defect\"; yet, in reality, cystic fibrosis is a selenium and fatty acid deficiency in the fetus and/or newborn breast-fed infant. If the mother has celiac disease, this can impede her absorption of essential nutrients, especially selenium, even more. In 1958, Dr. Kaus Schwartz reported in the NIH publication, Federal Proceedings, that selenium was an essential nutrient. The deficiency symptoms he reported all fit cystic fibrosis. But no one paid attention. In 1972, Cornell University found that chicks hatched from selenium deficient hens developed all the classical symptoms of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. But they too did not connect the finding to selenium. But they also discovered that, if selenium was given to the chicks within 30 days after hatching, they were totally cured within 21 days. In 1978, J.D. Wallach, a veterinarian researcher, identified this problem in animals and birds as being \"cystic fibrosis.\" But, when other researchers agreed with his findings, Wallach was fired within 24 hours from his government research laboratory. Since that date, Wallach has treated over 450 CF patients with excellent results. He has cured threemonth-old infants of the disorder. Wallach later did joint research with the Chinese Government in their hospitals, and helped thousands of their people. Yet, in America, the people are told CF is a \"genetic defect\" and nothing can be done, except expensive and time-consuming rehabilitation programs. Dr. Arthur F. Coco, inventor of the pulse test, made this statement: \"I am a realist. As long as the profit is in the treatment of symptoms rather than a search for causes, that's where the medical profession will go for its harvest.\" It is true that radiation is another cause of birth defects, yet only .1% of birth defects result from X rays, etc. Most pregnant women realize that they should avoid them. What is the solution to the problem? It is to give women a good nourishing diet. But it must begin a couple years before conception! Prevention of birth defects requires more than \"prenatal\" vitamins after the second month of pregnancy, when the physician gives his pronouncement, \"You are pregnant.\" By that time, the embryo has formed all organs and tissues—for better or worse! Proper supplementation of vitamins and minerals, nourishing food, and avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, drugs, and junk food must have had its effect on the mother's body—before conception took place! Do a home pregnancy test as soon as you suspicion the possibility, and immediately begin eating nourishing food and taking supplements. —A sample of such a birth defect is \"Cerebral Palsy.\" Also see \"Cystic Fibrosis.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—Faith is needed in the world today, faith that will lay hold on the promises of God's Word and refuse to let go until Heaven hears.",

CAUSES—Jaundice is probably the most common disorder in newborn babies. Old blood is broken down, by the liver, into bilirubin, a yellowish pigment. But when too much is made, the excess is dumped into the bloodstream and is deposited in tissues for temporary storage. About a fifth of infants have this, to one extent or another. \"Breast milk jaundice\" occurs in about 3% of infants. Peak levels of bilirubin do not occur until the tenth or fifteenth day, and may not return to normal for 12 weeks. But do not stop breast-feeding during this time. If the baby has prolonged jaundice, have a thyroid check done; he might have a tendency toward hypothyroidism (which see). Certain drugs given to the mother during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breast-feeding can lead to neonatal jaundice.

That is what it is called \"sudden infant death syndrome.\" The central nervous system is affected, which in turn suppresses the involuntary act of breathing. Each year, in the United States, there are 10,000 deaths from this problem. SIDS primarily occurs in the winter, primarily to underweight babies from poor families, and the mothers are generally under 20. Several possible causes have been traced: There may be high blood levels of the toxic mineral, lead. It has been reported that there are high levels of lead in infants who die of SIDS. Suffocation may be the cause. It has been found that infants who were laid on their stomachs, to go to sleep, are much more likely to suddenly die than infants who are laid on their backs. Breast-fed babies are less susceptible to SIDS. In addition, they have less allergies, respiratory diseases, hypoglycemia, obesity, and gastroenteritis. It is now known that SIDS can be caused by the pertussis vaccine, which is given to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.",

The result is an infected ring. Itching, burning, or pain may be present. The lesions appear to be circular. The area is often covered with small blisters. When the scalp is affected, the hair falls out in circular patches. The fingers can also be affected. CAUSES—Ringworm is a very contagious disease, caused by a parasitic fungus. It can infect children or adults, and is caused by unsanitary conditions. Keep the hands clean! Pet the dog and then rub your face, and you may regret it. Ringworm of the beard (face) is more persistent than ringworm of the scalp. Ringworm of the body is the easiest to eliminate. Dogs, cats, rabbits, children, and contaminated clothing are generally the carriers of the disease. There are several different types of ringworm, all of which are of fungal origin: Ringworm of the scalp - This can be on the scalp, face, and on the nails, is the most noticeable kind. It is highly contagious, and often found on school-children. It frequently induces baldness, which may become permanent if hair shafts are destroyed by the fungus. Ringworm of the trunk - This includes “jockey itch,” and is spread by contact with people or their clothing. Dogs and cats can also spread it. Ringworm of the nails - This consists of a fungus growing under the nails. It produces thickened, misshapen, brittle, discolored, chalky, pitted, or grooved nails. The nails can either be on the hands or the feet. This type of ringworm is quite difficult to eliminate. Ringworm of the feet - This is also known as athlete's foot (see \"Athlete's Foot\").",

Most of these common childhood diseases are contracted by nearly all children. Some experience only mild cough or cold while others have serious cases. A few receive permanent damage. If the child is receiving excellent nutrition— exercise, rest, sunshine, fresh air, etc.—he is unlikely to experience serious difficulty with these diseases. Louis Pasteur, developer of the germ theory of disease, said, \"The germ is nothing; it is the soil that matters.\" If the person is living a good life, the germ has a hard time obtaining a foothold. Avoid excess milk and carbohydrates, especially refined ones. Avoid sugar, fried food, and junk food. Include vitamin and mineral supplements in a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and similar natural foods. A well-fed child will usually be strong enough to resist the onslaught of childhood diseases. He may contract them; but the case will not be serious, usually brief, and often mild.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Inflammation and possible infection of the tonsils and the adenoids. If streptococcal bacteria have caused the infection, it is called strep throat. There is a sore throat with fever, lack of appetite, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, nasal obstruction and discharge. The lymph glands may become swollen. Symptoms continue for 24-72 hours, and then gradually subside over 7-10 days. The tonsils may look red and enlarged, and pus may be observed. CAUSES—The tonsils and adenoids are glands containing lymphatic tissue, located in the upper throat. Both are part of the immune system; they protect the body, at the top of the gastrointestinal tract, against infection. Each tonsil contains 200 million lymphocytes. We will here primarily deal with tonsillitis; treatment for adenitis is essentially the same. Strep throat also has the same treatment. When the body's resistance is lowered, viruses or bacteria (usually streptococcal) set to work. And a diet of processed and junk food, that is high in carbohydrates and low in protein, can also bring on this condition. If streptococcal infection (strep throat) is not present, then the throat condition is eliminated much quicker. If not cared for properly, strep throat can be potentially dangerous and can lead to rheumatic fever or meningitis. Food allergies weaken the body: usually cow's milk, chocolate, or too much white-flour or sugar products. Cow's milk or wheat are the two primary allergens to beware of. Antibiotics weaken the body more. The more frequently this infection occurs, the more difficult it is to eliminate. The tonsils become scarred from previous inflammations. Quinsy is peritonsillar abscess. It is an infection of the tonsil, between the tonsil and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. The solution is not a tonsillectomy, but the care specified below.",

Swelling often occurs in one gland first, and then begins in the other as swelling in the first subsides. But it may occur on only one side. CAUSES—Mumps is an infection of the salivary (parotid) glands, located in front of, and below, each ear. It rarely occurs before 3 years of age or after 40. Either direct contact or droplets spread the disease. Mumps is not as contagious as chickenpox or measles. But a person with the disease is still contagious from 48 hours, before symptoms develop, to 6 days afterward. Incubation is 14 to 21 days. One bout and lifetime immunity generally follows. If it is acquired after puberty, the ovaries or testes may become involved and sterility may result. Other complications can also occur, which affect the heart, kidneys, and brain. If no complications occur, complete recovery generally occurs within about 10 days. Swollen salivary glands can be caused by several other diseases: A partial list includes cirrhosis of the liver, leukemia, lupus, and tuberculosis (all of which are dealt with in this book). It also includes strep throat and the taking of certain drugs. If it is an isolated case of \"mumps,\" it might actually be something else.",

There are slight chills, possible vomiting and diarrhea, always fetid breath, difficulty in swallowing, and hoarseness. Children first complain of feeling tired and sleepy. The tonsils appear inflamed, dark red, and unevenly swollen. White, parchment-like patches appear on them. The glands in the neck usually swell. CAUSES—Diphtheria is an acute contagious disease. It begins 3-8 days after exposure and primarily occurs between 1 and 10 years of age. Part of the danger is the obstruction to breathing, due to the above-mentioned false membrane and is partly due to the toxins carried by the diphtheria germs which, carried throughout the body, especially harm the heart muscles, nerves, and kidneys. This is a serious disease. Diphtheria is transmitted by clothing, contact, domestic animals, and sometimes by raw milk. Anything (dish, garment, etc.) coming in contact with the person must be disinfected. Individuals can carry the germs on them for several years and transmit them to still others. A carrier should be isolated until the germs can no longer be found in his throat, nose, or catarrhal discharge. If there are no white patches or developing membrane, it is not diphtheria. The membrane is tenacious and dangerous. If not checked, it will cover the air tube and the child will suffocate. It is generally whitish, but may appear yellowish or greenish. When the child breathes harder and then has a frightened look, his air flow is narrowing. When someone develops diphtheria, there must be no delay. Give him vigorous treatment. You will want to call a physician.",

The eyes may be red, and the child seems to have a cold in the head. There is sneezing and watering of the eyes. Then a persistent cough develops, especially bad at night. This coughing continues a week, and keeps getting worse—and is the most significant indication that the problem may be whooping cough. In about 2 weeks, the typical whoop begins. At first, only 1-2 times a day, it degrades to every time there is coughing. It is a deep breath at the end of a series of deep coughs. The child's face may be reddish or bluish from the effort and lack of air. Vomiting may also occur. This whooping stage lasts 3-6 weeks, and the cough may not entirely disappear for several months. CAUSES—Whooping cough is a contagious bacterial disease, which usually attacks children between 6 months and 5 years of age. But infants and adults can also be affected. A person rarely has a second attack of this disease. The disease is not highly contagious after the first few weeks. The most contagious phase is before a definite diagnosis is possible. Whooping cough occurs more frequently, and seriously, in overcrowded and unhygienic quarters and cold weather. In very young, delicate, or undernourished children, it is more likely to develop into broncho-pneumonia—the principle cause of death in cases of whooping cough. Complications include convulsions, bleeding from the nose, into brain, or area around eyes. Bronchopneumonia can also occur; death only rarely. You may choose to have the child vaccinated at an early age (2 months is recommended for the series). You should weigh the fact that pertussis vaccine is one of the most dangerous of the shots in its occasional side effects.",

There can be confusion, drowsiness, memory lapses, lethargy, irritability or unusual belligerence. There may be weakness or paralysis in the limbs, speech impairment, hearing loss, double vision, etc. CAUSES—Reye's Syndrome is a disaster worth avoiding. This disease affects many internal organs, especially the brain and liver. It primarily strikes children between the ages of 4 and 15 (but most frequently young teens), in the fall or winter. Not long ago, the death rate stood at 42%-80%, but more recently it has dropped to below 10%. Most cases occur after a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox. Influenza B, Epstein-Barr virus, and viruses which primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract (enteroviruses) can also occur prior to its onset. It is known that giving aspirin to a child or youth who has a fever can lead to Reye's disease and the likely possibility of death. In the early 1980s, it was discovered that a viral infection, plus the taking of aspirin, dramatically increases the risk of developing Reye's syndrome. The cause of the disease may be consumption of aflatoxin, which is an exotoxin of the grain mold, aspergillus flavus. A biopsy generally shows liver necrosis (the liver is dying). Yet, if the person survives, there is a full recovery of the liver within 12 weeks. If you see the above symptoms, just after your child has come out of a viral illness—do something quickly! Here are the key symptoms again: (1) Agitation, disorientation, and delirium. (2) Fatigue, lethargy, and lapses in memory. (3) Prolonged and heavy vomiting, followed by drowsiness. Call a physician!

See the author's book, The Vaccination Crisis, (see order sheet) for detailed discussions of the various vaccines, their dangers, and how to avoid vaccination requirements. The underlying problem is simple enough: We normally take substances into our body through our stomach, where harmful bacteria are generally destroyed. But a vaccine is injected into a muscle or directly into the bloodstream, thus bypassing the normal protections. This is highly dangerous! The problem is that it is impossible to purify the vaccines properly. It would require too much time and expense to try to examine every microscopic portion, identify every toxin, poison, and microbe, and eliminate the bad ones. It simply cannot be done. So monkey pus and horse urine is \"purified\" somewhat, and then injected into your child. The solution is to live right, eat right, and avoid vaccinations.

A white vaginal discharge resembling cottage cheese. Itching, painful intercourse. In men—a clear, watery, urethral discharge. But often no symptoms at all. Genital Herpes: Itching and burning in the genital area. Discomfort when urinating. A watery vaginal or urethral discharge. Fluid-filled, weeping, eruptions in the vagina or on the penis. Genital Warts: Single or clustered, soft, cauliflower-like growths in and around the vagina, anus, penis, groin, and/or scrotal area. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): Fever and lower abdominal pain. A pus-filled vaginal discharge. Trichomoniasis: In women—a foamy, greenish or yellow, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, and pain. In men—a clear urethral discharge. Syphilis: a sore on the genitals; accompanied by rash, fever, patches of flaking tissue; sore throat; and sores in the mouth or anus. Gonorrhea: In women—a cloudy vaginal discharge, frequent and painful urination, vaginal itching. Inflammation of the pelvic area, rectal discharge, and abnormal uterine bleeding. In men—a pus-filled, yellowish, discharge. Often there are no symptoms for months. In women there may never be symptoms, yet all the while they are infecting men. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome): Aids has many symptoms; see \"AIDS.\" CAUSES—Venereal diseases are transmitted by intimate contact, when at least one has had more than one partner. STDs can cause urinary tract problems, sterility in women, and prostatic inflammation in men. At the present time, one teenage girl in four has a STD. Some of these diseases can kill newborn babies.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—In women, no symptoms may ever appear. When they do, it may include vaginal discharge, frequent and painful urination, abnormal menstrual bleeding, acute inflammation in the pelvic area, and rectal itching. Symptoms generally appear 7-14 days after sexual contact. In men, symptoms are generally present, including difficult and painful urination, a yellow discharge of pus, and mucous from the penis. Symptoms appear 2-14 days after contact. The discharge continues 6-8 weeks. CAUSES—As with syphilis (which see), the effects of gonorrhea keep getting worse. The secondary stage is difficult to detect and so is often misdiagnosed as arthritis. The gonorrhea is entering the bones, joints, tendons, and other tissues, causing mild fever, aches, inflamed joints, and sometimes skin lesions. In men, the outcome can be sterility. As long as 10 years later, the urethra may narrow or stricture, making urination difficult and at times impossible. This produces serious inflammation of the bladder. This occurs more often in men than in women. Women, who unknowingly contract gonorrhea from their husbands, generally do not know they have the disease until it is far advanced. The infection can travel up the uterus, into the Fallopian tubes, and out into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis and possibly death. If that does not occur, then the tubes may eventually seal off due to the infection, causing sterility and pus pockets which cause pain and infection.",

This is a red, painless, raised ulcer with hard, welldefined edges, and appears 10 days to 3 weeks after exposure, and lasts from a few days to several weeks. In women, it sometimes develops on the cervix and so is not recognized. Later, a rash and patches of flaking tissue appear in the mouth or genital area. This skin eruption consists of either a few red, pimply, blemishes or a profuse crop of various types of blotches. By this time, the disease is well-established throughout the system. Later stages occur, as the disease worsens. Paralysis, insanity, and death are the final outcome. CAUSES—Syphilis is caused by the germ, treponema pallidum, which is corkscrew in shape and much larger than most bacteria. Drying quickly kills the germs, so they must remain wet; they generally enter the body through a living source—another person (acquired syphilis) or through the placenta to the unborn child (congenital syphilis).

Nearly 20% of teenagers in the United States are known to have contracted it. But these figures do not include the large number that are not reported. Nearly 10% of men and 70% of women who have chlamydia—have no symptoms. So one can expect that the total number having, and sharing, this highly contagious disease is vast indeed. But, whether recognized or not, the effects of chlamydia are serious. About 30% of the women become sterile and pelvic inflammatory disease and other reproductive problems can, and do, result. In young women, the disease can also produce a form of arthritis. In men, prostate infection and seminal vesicle inflammation may occur later. (Symptoms of prostatitis include pain when urinating and a watery mucous urethral discharge.) The disease is transmitted through the discharge produced by both men and women. If one spouse is treated for this, the other one must be also. To delay treatment is to intensify the effects of the disease.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Loss of appetite, weight loss, candida, fatigue, various infections, intestinal problems, skin diseases, immune system disorders, fevers, brain and neurological disorders, and many other symptoms. CAUSES—AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a disease that does not need to happen. If people controlled themselves, it would never have gotten started, and would eventually die out. But, instead, it is an exploding epidemic. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) invades special immune cells in the body, which are called T lymphocytes, and then slowly multiplies over a long period of time. As it does so, the body's immune system gradually crumbles. All this time, the disease appears to lay dormant (and only an HIV test will reveal that a person even has the disease). But, after three to ten years, enough of the body's defenses are broken down that full-blown AIDS develops. Suddenly, very pronounced symptoms appear, which are called \"AIDS-related diseases.\" These include pneumo-cystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, found in 60% of those with AIDS), Karposi's sarcoma (a rare type of skin cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; which see), cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis. The less deadly AIDS-related diseases are often the first to appear. The first sign is often the tongue coated with white bumps. This is oral thrush, a type of candida (candidiasis; which see). Intestinal parasites (which see) and herpes simplex virus (herpes type I) are two other relatively simple infections which can occur. All indicate that the body's immune system is damaged, although candida, parasites, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus, and tuberculosis can occur in those who do not have AIDS. Most of those who are HIV-positive eventually develop full-blown AIDS. Once that occurs, they generally live only a few years. The median survival time, after full-blown AIDS appears, is 26 months. Researchers are searching for an \"AIDS cure\"; but the HIV virus changes form so fast, it is unlikely a cure will ever be found. Some say the origin of AIDS is unknown, and that the earliest documented case of it appeared in 1981 in San Francisco. But there may be undocumented cases of it in the 1970s. Others say that there is a different origin of AIDS. Dr. Eva Snead feels that the virus was created in the laboratories. She insists that, if you have been vaccinated, you have the virus. Then there is Dr. William Campbell Douglass, M.D., who, in his book, AIDS the End of Civilization, maintains that the vaccines were made from the kidney of the green African monkeys, and that the disease was purposely invented to eliminate certain people. The disease is transmitted by oral, vaginal, and anal sex; common needles for IV drugs; contaminated hospital and dental equipment; commercially prepared blood products; and immunotoxic lubricants. In other words, HIV is transmitted by sex, street drug IVs, blood transfusions, and getting someone else's blood into your eyes or into cuts on your skin. It is not possible to contract HIV by giving blood.",

Maintain an excellent immune system through proper diet, rest, exercise, etc. - But if you contract HIV, then you need to think through what you need to change in your life. And then set to work to rebuild your immune system. - Raw foods, such as fruits and vegetables, especially those high in vitamins A, B complex, C, and E are very important. Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance. Selenium and zinc, along with potassium, calcium, and magnesium are also important. - Garlic, cabbage, kelp, and lots of fresh and cooked greens are important. Eat whole-grain products. - Limit your intake of soy products, without fully dropping them. - Stop eating meat, processed food, and junk food. Banish tobacco, alcohol, and coffee. Avoid those who smoke. - Here are herbs which will help rebuild the immune system: echinacea, burdock, garlic, goldenseal, pau d'arco, psyllium, suma, and ginkgo. - Also important is black radish, dandelion root, and silymarin (milk thistle extract), to strengthen the liver. Aloe vera inhibits the growth and spread of HIV. St. John's wort tends to inhibit retroviral infections. Certain activities tend to tear down the immune system faster than anything else. Everyone should be aware of what those activities are: - Using any form of nicotine. - Drinking alcohol. - Using street drugs. - Taking medicinal drugs. - Eating primarily junk food. - Sexual excess, especially non-monogamous sex. - Overeating and getting little exercise. - Eating lots of pork, shellfish, and animal fat. - See your physician and/or follow the instructions for \"Cancer\" in this book.

CAUSES—There are two types of poisonous serpents in North America: The pit viper (which includes rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cotton mouths [also called water moccasins]) has a deep, heat-sensitive, pit on each side of the head. Pit vipers lunge forward, bite, and immediately pull back. Their venom contains a blood poison. The coral snake does not jump and, when it catches hold of the flesh, must hold on and chew awhile for the poison to sink in. Its venom is a nerve poison. More on identifying coral snakes: They are found only in the southernmost areas of the United States, as well as south of the border, and have brightly colored rings. There is a non-poisonous snake which looks similar, but the colored rings are arranged differently. Remember it this way: \"Red by black, friend of Jack; but black by yellow, kill a fellow.\" The danger from snake bite occurs when the poison reaches the heart, and, secondarily, the effect of that poison on the blood and nervous system. The action of the venom is rapid, regardless of the type of poisonous snake. There is rapid swelling and inflammation. If treatment is not immediately given, the poison may cause death. If not death, then, after the initial effects of pain and shock begin to wear off, extensive tissue damage begins. There is suppuration, gangrene, sloughing, and hemorrhage.

    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Between 2 and 32 days after the bite, symptoms appear: fatigue, flu-like symptoms, stiff neck, backache, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Ultimately, enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen may occur, along with irregular heart rhythm, arthritis, and brain damage. Some of these symptoms slowly pass away over 2-3 years. But sometimes symptoms recur later without having been bitten again. Because this disease is now so prominent, and because it can occur so mysteriously, here are more detailed symptoms on its usual 3 stages (which not everyone goes through): 1 - Small raised bumps (and/or a rash) appear on the entire body for 1-2 days or several weeks and then fades. Fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting may also occur. 2 - Weeks or months later, facial paralysis may occur. Frequently, enlargement of the spleen and lymph glands occurs and/or severe headaches, enlargement of the heart muscle, and abnormal heart rhythm. 3 - This can develop into backache, stiff neck, joint pains in the knees, swelling and pain in other joints, and even degenerative muscle and joint disease. Physicians especially look for these symptoms, before treating with antibiotics: a small red bump at the site of the tick bite; a bull's-eye rash surrounding it; and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, chills, and joint pain. If treatment is postponed until more advanced symptoms develop (heart, brain, or joint problems), drug medications do not work as well. CAUSES—The bite of a tiny tick (Ixodes dammini) is primarily carried by deer; but it is also carried, in the eastern states, by white-footed field mice and, in the west, by lizards and jackrabbits. In California it is also transmitted by the black-legged tick, carried by wood rats. Both deer ticks and black-legged ticks are very tiny: An adult is less than 1/10th of an inch, and the nymph is a pinhead in size. They are much smaller than a dog tick. Lyme disease most frequently occurs where the white-tailed deer is most abundant, which is the northeastern states. Eight states report 90% of the cases: Connecticut, Massachusetts, California, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. But it has occurred in every state except Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana, and Nebraska. The disease was first identified in the mid1970s in Lyme, Connecticut. Dogs and cats can collect these special ticks out in the woods and bring them into your home. Tick bites are generally painless and unnoticed; so the symptoms may not at first, or later, be correctly diagnosed. But in advanced stages, when correct diagnosis finally occurs, the situation may have become critical. The symptoms are similar to those of multiple sclerosis, gout, and Epstein-Barr virus (chronic fatigue syndrome), all three of which see. A test now exists which can detect the bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) which causes Lyme disease. Antibodies are present from 3 days to 3 weeks after infection. The majority of cases occur in the summer and fall. After a tick bites, it waits several hours before it begins to feed on the host's blood; and, once it does, it feasts for 3-4 days. The longer the tick remains attached, the greater the risk of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is treatable and almost always curable if correctly diagnosed in the early stages. But, because the bites are usually painless, the incubation period so long, and the symptoms so varied, the problem may go unrecognized for weeks or months. If you develop a bull's-eye type of rash anywhere on your body, see your health-care provider right away.",

Nurses check the pulse at the inside of the wrist. The author has found that it is much easier to check it on the upper front side of his neck, at the carotid artery. Have a stopwatch in your other hand and time the beats for one minute. To perform this test, you take your pulse. This is called your basal pulse or base pulse rate. Then you eat a single food, and check your pulse rate in 15, 30, and 60 minutes afterward. An elevation in pulse rate of more than ten beats; that is, it beats more than 10 beats faster per minute than your base pulse. This means that you are allergic to that food. A problem is that you may wish to eat more than one food at a time. You can take your base pulse, then sit down and eat your entire meal and keep checking your pulse 15, 30, and 60 minutes after you finished. In this way you will obtain an inkling that everything was all right at that meal or that something was wrong. Gradually, over a period of time, you can narrow it down, and then work on specific foods. Eating only one at a time and checking your pulse on those. OTHER TESTS—Here are several other tests: The Elimination Diet: Eliminate certain foods from your meal for several days, and see how it affects your pulse. This is a good pattern to use in connection with the Pulse Test. Food Rotation Diets: This is said to be a good method. Grains, proteins, and other suspected foods are arranged in the diet so that their consumption is not repeated more frequently than every 4-5 days. This helps you figure things out a little more quickly with your pulse test. The Fast Test: Fast for five days and then add individual foods and test each one with your pulse. This is far more accurate, but who wants to eat like a mouse all that time? The theory behind this method is that many reactions take 5 days to settle down and another 3-5 days to begin again. But following that theory, you will not be eating much for a good long time. Skin Patch Test: This is something you can buy at your drugstore. Perhaps it will tell you something. The Diet Diary: This method helps when offending foods seem to afterward bother you emotionally, give you headaches, etc. You keep an ongoing meal diary, at which you note what you ate, and afterward write down how it affected you. Within minutes or hours after eating an offending food, there may be indications of problems. The RAST Test—This test costs about $15 per food item, and you may want to use it, after narrowing the range with the other tests. The Radioallergiabsorbent Test (RAST Test) identifies specific antibodies in the blood to certain foods or other substances. Usually common allergenic foods, such as wheat, milk, eggs, yeast, and citrus are tested. But any food can be a problem. Most good laboratories do RAST tests. However, because it is extremely selective (only showing up positive Ige-mediated allergies), many false-negative reactions occur. The Cytotoxic Allergy Test: This test exposes some of your white blood cells to a fraction of the suspected food or substance. A battery of 38 to 40 tests of common foods are routinely tested for only $80 to $90, so it is less expensive and more convenient than RAST. Even inhalants, food dyes, or other chemicals can be tested! But the test is only done at large medical centers; and, again, many falsepositives occur. Some experts question the reliability of this test, since human interpretation is required to analyze the results. Unfortunately, results of RAST and the cytotoxic tests rarely agree. (It is said that each test locates different \"systems\" of allergies.) Frankly, it seems that you would do best just checking your pulse at home, and saving the money. Once you have identified specific allergenic foods, you then eliminate them from your diet. —See \"Allergies\" and \"Hay Fever.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—What must it be like to be close to God? It is a little heaven on earth, to go to heaven in. Yet, by daily surrender and prayer, we can each have this experience. Through the enabling strength of Christ obey His Ten Commandment law, and you will fulfill His plan for your earthly life. HAY FEVER (Allergic Rhinitis) SYMPTOMS—Itching in the nose, throat, and eyes. Runny or stuffy nose, headaches, pain in the head and sinuses, blurred vision, red and itchy eyes, postnasal drip. A clear, watery, discharge from the nose and eyes occurs. There is sneezing and nervous irritability. CAUSES—Hay fever is most frequently caused by breathing in plant pollens. (Ragweed and grass pollen are the worst offenders.) The problem tends to be seasonal (spring or fall), according to plant cycles. But some may have to suffer with it all year long if they are sensitive to dust, feathers, or animal danders. Such people are said to have perennial allergic rhinitis. Hay fever is a reaction of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and air passages to such seasonal pollens, as well as to dust, feathers, animal hair, and other irritants. Dry, windy, days; riding in an open car; and working in the garden sometimes increase symptoms. Morning and evening hours are the most uncomfortable. Midday may be better. Stressful situations and alcoholic beverages can trigger an attack. Anger, resentment, or negative thoughts can increase the symptoms. Hay fever sufferers frequently also have asthma and dermatitis. The body is trying to clean out toxins and dust. If the diet is not nutritious; if the person is eating too much or eating foods, such as milk, ice cream, sugar, …",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Pain, vomiting, cramping, weakness, diarrhea, dizziness. Symptoms occur quickly, 1-4 hours after eating the contaminated substance. They can last for a few hours or a few days. Salmonella symptoms: pain, vomiting, and diarrhea can require several days to appear. Staphylococcus aureus symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting 2-6 hours after the meal. It is good to induce vomiting, to help rid the system of toxins. Botulism symptoms: 12-48 hours after ingestion, symptoms appear. Extreme weakness, double vision, swallowing difficulty. Paralysis and death can follow. Giardia symptoms: Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, flatulence, and vomiting. CAUSES—Eating food containing harmful bacteria causes food poisoning. Each year more than 2 million Americans report food poisoning. Of course, the actual number is far higher. Unfortunately, we live in a poisoned age. About 2 million Americans report food poisoning each year; of that number, 9,000 people die each year. A far greater number have food poisoning, who think it is the flu. A full 90% of botulism cases in the United States are caused by improper home canning. The safest method is to cook the jarred food in a pressure cooker rather than in a tub on top of the stove. Two-thirds of all food poisoning cases were related to the use of poorly cooked eggs. The types of bacteria in food which cause disease (pathogenic) or produce toxins (toxigenic) cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled in the food. Here are the most common of these food poisoning organisms: Salmonella (Salmonellosis): This is the most common cause of food poisoning. It has especially increased since antibiotics began being placed in animal feeds, to prevent disease in crowded, unsanitary, conditions and help them grow faster. (More than 50% of cattle, poultry, and swine are now given antibiotics.) But, doing this, promoted the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal intestines. A third of all chickens in America have salmonella. Salmonella is easily transmitted on hands, food supplies, knives, table tops, cracked eggs, partly raw food, etc. Mechanical methods of evisceration in slaughterhouses also spread salmonella to all the other birds being slaughtered. Cooks that handle raw meat or eggs, and then handle other food—especially raw food, such as salads—endanger many people. Vegetarians should wash their hands with soap, immediately after handling raw egg shells. Cook eggs well. (Beware of mayonnaise; it contains raw eggs.) Milk and ice cream can also be contaminated with salmonella. In 1985, 17,000 people in the northeast became ill from contaminated milk. Outbreaks of salmonella poisoning primarily occur in the warmer months. Symptoms range from mild abdominal pain to severe diarrhea, and even typhoid-like fever. This disease can so weaken the immune system that the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels are damaged. Arthritis can result. Eating raw or poorly cooked chicken, eggs, beef, and pork products is the main way salmonella is eaten. But it can also be found in clams and oysters. Of 35 food poisoning outbreaks reported between 1985 to 1987, 24 were caused by contaminated eggs, or foods containing them. Boil eggs for at least 25 minutes. We will briefly note some other sources of food-borne illness: Staphylococcus aureus: This is said to be the second-largest source of food poisoning (25%). This can be transmitted by coughing and sneezing on food. Clostridium botulinum: This is old-fashioned botulism. Many restaurants and roadhouses leave food setting out at room temperature for hours. This can also be found in old mustard and other sauce jars. Although easily destroyed by cold or heat, botulism is the most deadly of all the food-borne diseases. It produces toxins which block nerve impulses to the muscles. Heating food to 176o F. for 20 minutes or 194o F. for 10 minutes destroys the spores. Home-canned food, not properly cooked, can be dangerous. Never use contents of a bulging can or a rusty can! It is found in canned vegetables, meats, fish, mushrooms, and soups. Giardia (giardiasis): This is found in drinking water from lakes and streams. It is not destroyed by water treatment, including chlorination. It can also be found in raw food which has grown in contaminated water. Giardia grows best where it is cool and damp. Four other sources of food poisoning should be mentioned: Staphylococcus, complobacter jejuini, campylobacteriosis, and clostridium perfringens. Each of these comes primarily from eating meat, and sometimes dairy products. Before concluding, keep in mind trichinae (trichinella), which is found in pork. Also beware of mold found on food; it can produce poisonous toxins. Do not eat potato sprouts; they have concentrated solanine which can cause hallucinations even after recovery.",

Worms sometimes causes spasms or convulsions. CAUSES—Worms live in the gastrointestinal tract or burrow from that tract into the muscles. There are several types of parasitic worms which can live in human intestines, including tapeworms, hookworms, pinworms, whipworms, and roundworms. The degree of infestation is determined, upon examination, by the type, size, and number of worms found. Worms tend to eat your food! They irritate your intestinal lining, and reduce even more the amount of nutrients which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The worms also produce toxic waste which is harmful to your body. Causes include eating raw or poorly cooked meat; eating vegetation, polluted by contaminated water; improper disposal of animal and human waste; and walking barefoot on soil. Scratching the anus will transfer worm eggs on your fingers to anything else you touch. Pinworms: Very tiny white worms, which cause rectal itching at night. Contracted by eating raw or poorly cooked vegetables which have contacted contaminated water. Scratching the anal area can also transmit them on the fingers. (Also see \"Rectal Itching.\") Tapeworms: Flat worms contracted from eating poorly cooked meat (beef, pork, and fish). The most common one (beef tapeworm) can grow to 20 feet in length in the human intestine. Hookworms: Found in southern soil and sand, they enter by boring into the feet, but can also enter when eating with unwashed hands. Roundworms: Most common in children, they bore through the intestinal wall and settle in other organs. Because of the warmth of the bed, worms tend to come out of the anus. So inspect that area on children after they are asleep. Worm infestation can lead to arthritis, colitis, fatigue, diabetes, headaches, indigestion, lupus, nausea, sinus trouble, back and neck pain, and cancer.",

It is impossible to escape from them, but knowledge and care can reduce the rate at which these hazards cause us harm. Metals, such as mercury, chrome, nickel, and beryllium produce skin rashes. Aluminum is the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. - Lead causes anemia. - Dental fillings containing mercury can poison the system. - Herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, fumigants, and fertilizers seep into the soil, ground, water, and wells. - These poisons are taken up by the plants which animals, birds, and humans eat; it passes on into milk, eggs, meat. The toxic substances are in the fruit and vegetables we eat. - There are food preservatives and additives. There are artificial colorings, flavorings, and odors. These come from coal tar and lead to cancer. - Waxes are on the fruit, and added sprays are on the vegetables. There are ripening agents and defoliant chemicals. - There are toxic fumes, dangerous chemicals, and radioactive wastes. The rivers and lakes are polluted with poisonous runoff. - There are hair sprays, treated bedding, animal hair products, paint formulas, and exotic cleaning formulas. - There is benzene from solvents, styrene from plastics, and formaldehyde from pressedwood products. - Smoke arises from cigarettes, cigars, and burning forest fires. - We hardly have time to worry about old-fashioned dust, molds, parasites, and diseases.

Other symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, colic, rickets, extreme nervousness, headache, anemia, poor kidney and liver function, speech disturbances, memory loss, weak and aching muscles, and softening of bones. It is believed, by many, that Alzheimer's disease is caused by aluminum poisoning. Aluminum was little used until the 1940s, when an inexpensive method was found to extract it from Bauxite by running an electric current through that ore. Since then, Alzheimer's has rapidly increased. An excess of either aluminum or silicon in the body results in reduced absorption of calcium and other minerals. Aluminum salts in the brain produces impaired mental abilities and seizures. The autopsied brains of Alzheimer's patients had four times as much aluminum as did those of other people. Aluminum also damages the kidneys which try to excrete it from the body. WHERE FOUND—Aluminum pots, pans, and other cookware. Aluminum foil, antiperspirants, deodorants, bleached flour, regular table salt, tobacco smoke, processed cheese, cream of tartar, douches, canned goods, baking powder, antacids, buffered aspirin, and most city water. Processed cheese is high in it, for the aluminum helps it melt when heated. Never use aluminum (or copper) cookware! Use stainless steel or glass whenever possible.

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Lead poisoning produces hyperactivity in children, behavioral problems, and weakened minds. Chronic lead poisoning causes reproductive disorders, impotence in men, infertility in women, and anemia. Sudden infant death syndrome occurs more often in infants with high lead levels than those who die of other causes. Toxic amounts damage liver, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. Those suffering from lead poisoning will have days of severe gastrointestinal colic. Gums turn blue and he may feel muscle weakness. Paralysis of the extremities, blindness, mental disturbances, protein disorder, loss of memory, mental retardation, and even insanity can eventually result. Painter's colic shows severe wandering pain in the abdomen and acute muscle spasm. Sometimes you will find a lead line on the gum margin of the teeth. WHERE FOUND—Lead is extremely toxic, and is widely found in leaded gasoline; lead pipes; and other piping using solder, ceramic glazes, lead-based paints, and lead-acid batteries. Lead arsenate is an insecticide used on certain plants. Burning newspapers throw lead into the air. Lead is in commercial baby milk and industrial materials (nails, solder, plating, plaster, and putty). People also consume it when they use tobacco, eat liver, and drink domestic or imported wines. It can also be in soldered cans. SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing lead. Avoid lead sources and environments. Buy only canned goods which are lead-free. These cans have been welded and have no soldered side seems. Do not use imported canned goods; no regulations cover them. Only drink distilled water. Drink plenty of fruit and vegetable juices. Stay off the main highways whenever possible, and do not live near them. Lead fumes and other noxious chemicals and metals are still coming out of car exhausts. Do not grow family garden crops near the highways. Do not have lead or copper water pipes in your home; use PVC (plastic) pipes instead. Copper pipes are connected with lead solder. Solder leaches a significant amount of lead into the water supply, especially during the first few years after installation. Lead solder was not banned until 1986. Do not drink out of glazed pottery—especially if it is imported! The glaze can contain lead, which will leach into your fruit juice, etc. Vitamin E tends to reduce the effects of lead poisoning. Drink aloe vera gel or liquid. —For additional information, see \"Chemical Poisoning.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—If we have Christ abiding with us, we shall be Christians at home as well as abroad. He who is a Christian will have kind words for all he associates with. As we do this, our own hearts will be warmed the more with Christ's love.",

    "facet": "overview",
    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Allergies, anxiety, metallic taste, gastroenteritis, burning mouth pain, salivation, abdominal pain, tremors, uncontrolled crying, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Mercury poisoning can lead to colitis, kidney disease, dermatitis, asthma, hair loss, gingivitis, mental and emotional disturbances, and nerve damage. It is believed, by many, that multiple sclerosis is caused by mercury poisoning. Arriving in the brain, it is stored there and produces dizziness, insomnia, weakness, fatigue, depression, and memory loss. Symptoms in a child include hyperactivity, irritability, depression, and behavioral changes. WHERE FOUND—Mercury is more toxic than lead, and can be ingested or inhaled. It is stored in the brain and in the fat. At normal temperatures, it tends to change from a solid into a gas. This means that the mercury in the amalgam fillings in your mouth are always ready, when the opportunity presents itself, to pass into saliva and be swallowed. Acids in food provide that opportunity. Amalgam is over 50% mercury. Minute amounts of methyl mercury are released from the tooth filling as you chew your food. Eventually it passes into the organs and brain. Nearly 100 chemicals are placed in mouths by dentists—including mercury, copper, nickel, beryllium, zinc, phenol, formaldehyde, disocyanate, and acetone. Mercury is also found in streams, lakes, fish, shellfish, and sewage. The problem is that it is added to insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Grains and seeds are frequently treated with it, to keep out bugs. We would rather eat a stray bug than mercury. Gradually these substances have gone into the rivers and lakes, contaminating the fish. Mercury is also included in fabric softeners, polishes, wood preservatives, latex, solvents, plastics, ink, and some paints. It is in cosmetics, laxatives which have calomel, some hemorrhoidal suppositories, and a variety of other medications. SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing mercury. Avoid mercury sources and environments. Remove the mercury (amalgam) fillings from your teeth. Sweating helps excrete mercury. Selenium also helps eliminate it. —For additional information, see \"Chemical Poisoning.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—Tell the one in trouble, \"Let us pray.\" Kneel down together and unload your hearts to God. Find in Him the peace and help that both of you need.",

WHERE FOUND—Medical and dental X rays (which see), television, cellular phones, video display terminals, satellite dishes, building materials containing radon or uranium, computers, microwave ovens, satellites, high-voltage electric lines, radar devices, electronic games, smoke detectors, and tobacco. Radioactive substances are composed of unstable atoms which can harm the body. When radiation strikes a cell, it alters, damages, or destroys it. Whether a little or a lot, radiation is a killer. Living tissue is damaged when ionizing radiation strikes it. This is radiation powerful enough to shift electrons from one collection of atoms to another. Such restructuring of tissue can result in disease or cancer. A significant percentage of women inherit a gene that is sensitive to X-ray exposure. In those women, even a short exposure to X rays can lead to cancer. SOLUTIONS—Avoid radiation sources and environments. In order to protect the body from radioactive elements, you must eat enough non-radioactive ones. For example, if you are not obtaining enough calcium, your body will absorb radioactive strontium-90 from the air. Where did the strontium-90 come from? from an exploded nuclear bomb halfway around the world. The same is true for regular iodine vs. radioactive iodine (iodine-131), which destroys the thyroid. Foods which protect against radiation include fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Foods which reduce one's ability to be protected against radiation include meat, poultry, dairy products, sugar, refined food, and food with chemical additives. —For additional information, see \"Chemical Poisoning.\" ENCOURAGEMENT—Our time here is short. We can pass through this world but once. While we are here, let us do all we can to help and bless others. There are so many around us who need our help.

As the condition worsens, there is strong anxiety, fear, and panic, and depression. Convalescence and recovery can be slow, with the possibility of permanent nerve damage. CAUSES—This is another disease produced by vaccinations. Normally, such a condition would never occur. But when fluids, drawn from animals, are injected into the human bloodstream, terrible consequences can result. Gerald Ford's introduction of a nationwide vaccination program, in the winter of 1976-1977, was a disaster and resulted in many cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other possible factors could be surgery, a viral infection, Hodgkin's disease, rabies, or lupus (each of which, except surgery, see).",

    "content_en": "CAUSES—It is truly surprising what a high percentage of medicinal drugs are poisonous. But it need not be, when the underlying modus operandi (method by which they work) is understood. Medicinal drugs work by introducing a strange new poison into the body. The system immediately turns its attention from the debilitated area—and begins fighting the drug. The type of poison (the drug) introduced, and the way it operates, affects the reaction of the body. For example, the body was eliminating sulphur through a boil but then a drug is introduced, and the boil seemingly \"heals.\" The body has let the boil no longer suppurate, so attention can be diverted to the radical poison which has been introduced. Natural remedies operate in a different way: They clean out the body and restore it to a healthy normalcy. Whether it be fresh air, pure water, nutritious food, simple herbs, or water treatments, the natural remedies assist the body in carrying on its work of cleansing the body. For that is what \"dis-ease\" is: an effort of nature to cleanse the body of impurities and eliminate the effects of enervation. A drug is a foreign substance of a poisonous nature. The healing herbs are not \"drugs.\" It is true that about five of every 100 herbs is poisonous, but natural therapy only uses the safe ones. The poisonous ones can be purchased at the drugstore or grocery counter (tobacco, coffee, black tea, chocolate, black pepper, digitalis, quinine, etc.). Such things as aspirin, valium, phenobarbital, dilantin, morphine, etc., are foreign chemical substances of a poisonous nature. They all produce dangerous side effects, called \"contraindications.\" In contrast, the safe herbs are the ones you eat (all your worthwhile vegetables) and use for treating your ills. They were given us by the God of heaven (Genesis 1:29). Most of the damage that drugs inflict on the body is beneath the skin, but drug rashes are effects on the skin. Here are but a few examples of drugs which produce drug rashes: Antipyrine: Papular, erythematous rash, sometimes accompanied by edema and much irritation. Arsenic: Papular or erythematous rash, sometimes urticarial. Prolonged use may produce pigmentation of skin. Belladonna: Erythematous rash, usually accompanied by intense itching. Bromides: Usually like acne vulgaris. Sometimes erythema. Chloral: Papular erythema. Iodides: Usually papular erythema, sometimes with acne-like pustules. Phenolphthalein: Macular rash, sometimes purpuric. Quinine: Very irritable erythema or urticaria. Salicylate: Erythematous rash, possibly morbilliform. Serum: Usually urticaria. Sulfonal: Erythematous or urticarial rash. Here are some other drugs which produce skin rashes: opium compounds, acetanilide, amidopyrine, barbiturates, ephedrine, novocain, sulfanilamide, and other sulfa drugs. Some of the drugs have been given very nice-sounding names, but note the chemicals in them: calomel (mercurous chloride), green vitriol (ferrous sulfate), goulard water (lead lotion), oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid), and vermilion (mercury sulfide). Most drugs are compounded from, not two but, a wide range of extremely complex and very poisonous chemical mixtures. Let it be emphasized that most drugs work their damage in a thousand other ways in the body, without producing skin rashes.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—A continual craving for tobacco in some form. If the person smokes, there is irritation and inflammation of throat and lungs, chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, and premature aging of the skin. This eventually leads to lung cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, emphysema, respiratory ailments, heart disease, stroke, and/or many other diseased conditions and cancers. Women will have intensified problems with menstruation and menopause, and men will have greater prostate trouble. Women who smoke age twice as fast as other women. Their skin rapidly ages; and the result is a dull, lifeless, gray, deteriorating complexion, and wrinkles. If one chews tobacco, there is irritation and inflammation of the lips, mouth, teeth, throat, and esophagus. This eventually leads to cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, and other diseases. CAUSES—Nicotine is remarkable for the vast number of harmful chemicals it naturally contains, and those which are added to it during growth or processing of the leaves. Nicotine is also remarkable for its addictive qualities. It ranks with heroin, and some who have been hooked on both declare it to be worse to quit than heroin. Like heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, tobacco gives a sense of relaxing while making the heart pump harder (12-25 beats per minute faster), causing palpitations and a generalized feeling of anxiety. For the smoker who takes the last puff before bedtime, the circulatory system is only normal 2 hours out of every 24. Each cigarette destroys 25 mg of vitamin C; a full pack in one day eliminates more of this vitamin than is in the diet. In America alone, tobacco causes 35% of all cancer deaths, 78% of all fatal heart attacks, 18% of deaths of all kinds, 85% of lung cancer, and 85% of obstructive pulmonary disease. More Americans die each year from smoking than from alcohol, illegal drugs, traffic accidents, murder, or suicide. Those coffin nails shorten lifespan by at least 15-20 years. These are some of the blessings you get from the nicotine: lead, carcinogens, cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and over 5,000 other irritating chemicals in tobacco. Tobacco not only injures you, but it also damages those around you: your spouse, your children, your unborn, and fellow workmen. Did you know that the breath of a smoker contains slightly more nicotine than the side smoke from his cigarette? Men and women who smoke are constantly exhaling air into the room for their children to breathe.",

Depression; blackouts; hangovers; vehicle, and other, arrests; ulcers; emotional problems; flushing of the face; forgetfulness; heart palpitation; indigestion; insomnia; urinary problems; hepatitis; hypertension; divorce; hard drugs; and numbness in the extremities. CAUSES—Alcohol is absorbed directly through the walls of the stomach, without digestion. It then travels in the bloodstream to every cell in the body, where it extracts water. This weakens or kills cells. The effect on the liver, brain, and vital organs is especially damaging. Most alcoholics are either hypoglycemic or borderline diabetics. In addition, alcohol produces severe nutritional deficiencies. The body thinks it is well-fed (alcohol contains 70 calories per ounce), when it is being slowly starved. The liver slowly breaks the alcohol down to sugar. Eventually the difficult task weakens this vital organ, and fatty liver degeneration begins. Scar tissue develops; the experts call it cirrhosis. Alcohol is deceptive: It makes a person feel happy when he is miserable, and makes him feel strong when he is weak. It ruins his liver, destroys his marriage, hurts his children, eliminates his employment, and makes a bum out of him. The liquor industry should be closed down.",

In the bladder: Blood in the urine. In the cervix: A heavy watery, bloody, discharge from the vagina. Bleeding may occur after intercourse, between periods, and after menopause. CAUSES—Polyps (polyposis) are growths of various sizes, and are especially found in certain portions of the mucous membranes: the nose, large intestine (colon), bladder, and cervix. They are especially common in the rectum and the portion of the colon just above that (the sigmoid). These growths are benign (that is, not cancerous) and, growing on stalk-like structures, look something like narrow mushrooms. They tend to be hereditary. Nasal polyps: Generally when the nose is clogged, the cause is a heavy cold or possibly chronic catarrh. But it can be nasal polyps. These are a special kind of tumor, which usually form as a result of a chronic infection in a sinus or in persons having allergies. Surgical removal is done to remove them. Colon and rectal polyps: These growths in the outlet end of the colon can become cancerous. A colectomy is the surgical removal of these polyps, but is generally done, not by cutting out the polyps, but by removing part of the colon! Sometimes the rectum is left in place and the small intestine is connected to it. But, whether this drastic operation is performed or not, the polyps generally return. Bleeding from the colon can be a sign of polyps or of cancer. Bladder polyps: The medical route is removal of the bladder. Unless they are removed, by natural methods or unnatural, bladder cancer may result. Cervical polyps: These polyps line the inside of the cervix of the uterus and are more common in women who have not had children. They rarely return after being removed.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—In the most common types: Lumps are firm, do not go away, and are generally pain free. Lumps which do not move around may be malignant or may not be. In another type: There is itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple. In yet a third type: The breast becomes extremely tender and appears infected with something. These three are explained in more detail below. CAUSES—Breast cancer is a leading cause of malignant death among women in the United States. Women over forty are more likely to develop breast cancer than younger women. Lung cancer kills about 56,000 women in America each year, and breast cancer is responsible for the death of about 46,000. It is vital that early detection be made. Discussions of how to carry out breast self-examination are readily available elsewhere and need not be repeated here. As you conduct it, watch for subtle changes in the breast. You are looking for special types of lumps in the breast. These lumps are firm, do not go away, and are generally pain free. Lumps which do not move around may be malignant or may be caused by normal fibrocystic changes during the menstrual cycle. The experts say a biopsy will detect what kind of lump it is. But you should know that biopsies can be dangerous. A biopsy is a slice of the tissue which is then sent to a lab for microscopic examination. The problem is that slicing any suspected tissue—immediately releases its cancer (if any is present) into the body, where it can more rapidly spread. You may or may not choose to have biopsies made, but you should be aware of this fact. You will often hear it said that \"1 in 9\" women will contract breast cancer—but that is sometime within a lifetime. The average 30-year-old white woman has a 1 in 5,900 chance of getting it; at 50 years, it is 1 in 430. There are several different types of breast cancer. Most of them are similar, producing lumps described above. But a few are different: Paget's disease of the nipple affects the nipple, and cannot be detected by a self-examination. Cancer cells have migrated to the nipple. The symptoms are itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple. This form of cancer only occurs when a different form of cancer is present elsewhere in breast tissue. Inflammatory carcinoma is a different type. The skin thickens and turns red. The breast becomes extremely tender and appears infected with something. The lymphatic system and blood vessels have become clogged because of a tumor. This type of cancer spreads very rapidly. Professionals recommend a biopsy; but, if you choose not to do so, you must be planning to go on an intense natural remedies cleansing, to eliminate the problem. Whatever you do, you had better set to work and do it.",

    "content_en": "SYMPTOMS—Possible pain or burning sensation during urination, frequent urination, a decrease in the size and force of urine flow, an inability to urinate, blood in the urine, and continuing lower-back or pelvic discomfort just above the pubic area. But there may be no symptoms until an advanced stage or until the cancer spreads out beyond the prostate. Many, many, times the above symptoms point to a benign enlargement of the prostate and is not cancer in that organ. CAUSES—The prostate is a walnut-sized gland at the base of the bladder and encircles the urethra, the tube through which the bladder voids urine. The prostate makes prostatic fluid which nourishes the sperm. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Americans. Poor diet, exposure to environmental toxins and cancer-causing chemicals, and overactivity of the sexual organs are possible causes. There is a link between a high-fat diet and prostate cancer. It is believed, by some, that a vasectomy may increase the likelihood that this problem will later develop. Men over 65 have 80% of the cases of prostate cancer, and 80% of 80-year-old men have it. The younger a man is, when he is diagnosed with prostrate cancer, the worse the outlook. Those with recurring prostate infections are at greater risk. Men whose ancestors had prostate cancer are more likely to develop it. African American men have the highest rate, and Asiatic American men have the lowest. A careful, but relatively simple, rectal examination can reveal if cancer is developing in this organ. There are also other screening methods, and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) appears to be the best. The PSA test should be taken twice if there is an indication of cancer. —For much, much, more discussion and suggestions on this, and other, malignancies, see \"Cancer.\"",

A persistent change from normal in the action of the bowels or bladder. Any persistent lump or thickening in breast or anywhere on the body. Hoarseness or nagging cough. Difficulty in swallowing. Persistent indigestion or loss of appetite, especially if accompanied by loss of weight. Sudden or rapid changes in the form, appearance, or rate of growth of a mole or wart or if it bleeds. Fatigue. To the basic eight cancer signs, listed above, we are adding three others which are important: any condition which does not respond to treatment, inflammation from blood clotting (thrombophlebitis), and putrid intestinal gas. Skin cancer: A lump under the skin, moles which change color or size and have raised edges, an ulcer which does not heal, flat sores, lesions which look like moles. Mouth or throat: Chronic ulcer of the mouth, tongue, or throat which does not heal. Larynx: Persistent cough and hoarse throat. Lung: Persistent cough, bloody sputum, and chest pain. Breast: Lump which is hard, does not go away, and does not move; inflammation or thickening of the skin. (See \"Breast Cancer\" for more signs.) Leukemia: Whiteness of skin, weight loss, fatigue, repeated infections, easy bruising, nosebleeds. Stomach: Indigestion and pain after eating. Bladder and Kidney: Blood in urine and increased urination frequency. Bloody urine is generally not a cancer symptom, but it can be. Ovaries: Usually there are no obvious symptoms until later stages. Endometrium: Bleeding between menstrual periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods. Cervical and Uterine: Bleeding between periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods. Prostate: Weak or interrupted urine flow; continuous pain in lower back, pelvis, and/or upper thighs. Testicles: Enlargement of a testicle, lumps, thickening of scrotum, sudden excess of fluid in scrotum, mild ache in lower abdomen or groin. Colon: Blood in stools, rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea and/or constipation). Lymphoid Tissue: Enlarged, rubbery, lymph nodes; itching; night sweats; unexplained fever and/or weight loss. CAUSES—In this article, you will find an overview of many research studies and data. Cancer is now the second most common killer in the United States and is increasing. One in every three people will die from some form of it. Over 1,400 Americans die each day with it. Cancer cells are wild, irregular, and different from other body cells. They grow rapidly and gradually invade and fill surrounding areas. They rob neighboring cells of nutrition, resulting in a gradual wasting away of the patient. They can migrate to new locations and multiply. Wherever they go, there are abnormal growths and tumors. Cancer cells are classified by the organs they initially invade (liver, breast, colon, lung, lip, etc.). There are more than 100 different varieties of cancer. Each varies in its symptoms and how fast it spreads. There are four main types of cancer: Carcinomas affect the skin, mucous membranes, glands, and other organs. Leukemias are blood cancers. Sarcomas affect muscles, connective tissue, and bones. Lymphomas affect the lymphatic system. Early detection and treatment is vital. One person dies every 3 minutes from cancer. Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner, stated: \"More is known about the cause and prevention of cancer than most any other disease.\" Dr. Ronald Raven, Chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, said: \"Seventy-five percent of all cancer can be prevented if we utilize the facts we now possess.\" At the Eighth International Cancer Congress, Dr. Kavetsky said: \"It is essential in the treatment of tumorous disease, not only to act on the tumor, but to endeavor to strengthen the compensatory and defensive reaction . . of the entire system.\" When a cancer becomes noticed, it is already far advanced. At this stage, it is important that the one with it place himself under the care of a competent physician who understands and uses nutritional therapy. However, the patient needs to understand, for himself, what is required and what he must do. There are situations in which a cancer victim has no one to help him, and he must carry out such a program entirely on His own. But, whether helped by others or going it alone, unless the individual fully cooperates with right principles, he cannot be successfully helped. He must cease his violations of the natural laws, given by God to mankind, and live fully in accordance with them. The type of food we eat, the way we live, and environmental factors gradually build up or weaken the body. If the organs of elimination cannot keep up with the amount of toxic waste we are producing, in desperation the body eventually turns to the formation of tumors and cancers. Soft cancers are cells gone wild because of the excess waste in the system. Hard tumors are garbage cans prepared to hold the toxic waste. Cancer generally has a lengthy incubation period of years. Nourishing the body, building up the immune system, and avoiding excess and debilitating substances enables the body to resist cancer. Because of intemperate living, eating, sleeping, combined with stress, the body is weakened over the years. This produces a chronic autointoxication—poisons have accumulated in the body. Vital organs, whose job it is to purify and eliminate wastes (such as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bowels), become less active and efficient. The system becomes poisoned. These poisons accumulate around the weakest organs or where the body has been injured by a bruise, fall, or blow. The accumulated poisons from years of tea, coffee, tobacco, cola, meat, liquor, fried food, etc., especially accumulate in such an area. Then the body either tries to build garbage cans (tumors), to hold the waste products or the cells in that …",

In one type, the spleen is enlarged; in another, the lymph glands are also enlarged. CAUSES—This is called cancer of the blood, but it is actually cancer of the bone marrow, where the blood is made. Leukemia (which means \"white blood\") produces a defect in the production of white blood cells, resulting in large numbers of immature WBCs in the blood stream. WBCs are vital to physical health; and, without them, the body deteriorates. The bone marrow continues to produce an excess of them; yet many of those produced and dumped into the blood stream are essentially useless. A blood test reveals anemia (not enough red blood cells), low platelet count, increased lymphoblasts (an excess of immature WBCs), and an elevated total WBC count. Chronic cases run an up and down course for several years. Acute cases generally end fatally in a few weeks. As a rule, leukemia ends in death. A person can choose to go the medical route or try natural remedies. There will, of course, be a risk and the very real possibility of death, whatever his decision may be.",

As many layers of clothing should be worn on the extremities as are worn on the trunk. This is especially important in cancer of the breast or skin. - A biopsy is a thin slice of tissue, taken to examine it for possible carcinoma (cancer).

Yet some famous medical dictionaries say nothing about diet in cancer treatment, except to keep the diet under 2,000 calories. The truth is there is a close relationship between the food we eat and what happens in our bodies. - Meals, bedtime, periods of study, etc. should be according to a regular schedule. Avoid noise, smog, television, worry, stress, and confusion. Do some reading every day. Reading in God's Word, accompanied by simple trustful prayer brings healing to heart, soul, and body. - Dr. Josef Issels' cancer clinic, in Germany, is an example of a well-rounded program. In addition to other things mentioned in this book, he prescribes plenty of rest, complete freedom from worries and mental stress, and plenty of fresh, pure air day and night. To the degree the patient is strong enough for it, and as he improves, there is lots of exercise and walking. - Some, in a position to do so, may wish to move to a warm, unpolluted climate (any left?) where fresh air and sunshine is continually available. Build up the system with good food, exercise, and rest. - Continual overwork and exhaustion can lay the groundwork for the development of cancer. - City living, with its hurry, noise, confusion, and air and water pollution, can also provide the inferior living conditions which lead to malignant conditions.",

Dunbar says, \"only certain types of people succumb to cancer.\" - Two Soviet researchers (Serov and Troskin) demonstrated that negative emotions reduce the white blood count in an alarming manner, hindering a major body defense against disease. - Researchers at the Rochester Medical Center in New York have found that people are more likely to contract cancer if, more than others, they have a harder time dealing with severe emotional conflicts and stresses, have uncontrolled anxieties and worries, experience traumatic emotional experiences or losses, have strong feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, hopelessness, and desperation. It may not be that such negative attitudes cause the cancer, but they keep the person from resisting and conquering it. - Maintain a strong sense of purpose. Find something to do with yourself. In one church which the author once pastored, a woman bedridden for years before her death would phone people at random and encourage and pray with them. Between calls, she would pray for them. She was a radiant sunbeam. - A strong trust in God and peace in Him is the solution. Man innately knows that he cannot solve his own problems; he needs God! Only in Him can we find the strength and courage to press forward.

Over the past 75 years a number of studies have linked stress to susceptibility to cancer (R. Ader, Psychoneuroimmunology, 1981). Strong stress in a child can also lead to it (B.L. Bloom, et. al., Psychological Bulletin 85 no. 4, 1978). Adults who who had recently lost a loved one, or were widowed, divorced, or separated, have the highest cancer rates (B.L. Ernster, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 63, no. 3, 1979). - Ronald Grossarth-Maticek, M.D., a European researcher, spent 20 years working along a line of study which has been rejected by orthodox medicine. His concept is called Creative Novation Behavior Therapy, and it concerns people with certain personalities; that is, having certain mental-emotional attitudes, are the most likely to contract cancer. - Grossarth-Maticek is a Yugoslavian oncologist (cancer specialist) who used mortality data in Heidelberg, Germany. - People who view life in a certain way are more prone to develop cancer. - Type C persons are unable to solve problems in relationships with other persons, situations, and goals. When relationships are crushed, circumstances go back, or goals become unachievable, these people react by sinking into a depression, characterized as feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Type C people are highly prone to cancer. - Type H persons also have the same difficulties named above, but they react quite different to such problems. Instead of feeling hopeless and helpless, they become angry and frustrated. Type H people tend to develop heart disease. - Type F persons learn how to roll with the punches. They are free of fears and worries, for they give them into God's hands to care for. Although they encounter problems as others do, they trust in God, recognize their own limitations, and, when difficulties arise, keep moving forward cheerfully. This type tends to die of other causes, such as accidents. They tend not to die of cancer or heart or circulatory problems. - These people are not living under stress, with aroused hormonal flow, such as type 1 and 2 personalities have. They are at peace with life. They accept what has to be, change whatever they can change, and, with God's help, keep cheerfully on their way, helping others as they go. - Still other researchers have found other aspects of this Type C (cancer-prone) personality. The main aspect they have noted is loss, either loss of a loved one, or loss of hope. Many cancer patients feel a profound sense of helplessness and despair, particularly about the meaning of their existence. Frequently, they need peace with God. - A second characteristic is the suppression or repression, of emotions. - The third factor is loneliness. Such people tend not to have close friends. (H. Dreher, Your Defense Against Cancer, 1988, 246-247.) - All three factors could be nicely resolved if such individuals would come to God and find in Him the encouragement, the forgiveness, and strength they need to meet life's difficulties.",

Take 20 deep breaths, hold each one for several seconds, and then slowly exhale. Exhale to full compression, and then inhale again. Do this several times a day—always outdoors. This, along with outdoor walking, will help clean the lungs. - Soviet scientists demonstrated that a complex link exists between cancer and not breathing deeply enough or breathing stale air too much. One researcher in the Western world said that forced deep breathing, out of doors, at least 3 times a day to the point of dizziness, will help furnish an ample supply of oxygen. - It is well-known that cancer cannot live in an oxygen-rich environment. - (Many researchers seem not to be aware of the negative ion factor. Breathing deeply out of doors supplies both oxygen and negative ions to the body. Negative ions provide a much-needed electric charge needed by the nerves.) - If at all possible, sleep in a room that receives sunlight during the day.

Add to that a seventh: the immune system, working together with the white blood cells, the T-cells, and vitamin C. (Vitamin E also purifies and detoxifies, but it carries on this function in the liver.) - The first step is to cleanse the blood by relieving constipation, making all the organs of elimination active, and keeping them active. Take herbal laxatives or enemas. - A daily bowel movement is essential, even if an enema or colonic is required. All foods which ferment in the bowel should be avoided. Absolutely no meat or fish! - Bowel movements need to be complete evacuations, even if enemas are necessary. The cleansing program is releasing so many toxins, it is important that they be flushed out. Enough water must be drunk every day. - If necessary, keep the bowels clean with herbal laxatives or enemas. When the body is toxic, the bowels become sluggish; waste matter is reabsorbed by the blood and lymphatic system, which is circulated throughout the body and stored in tumors or other trash sites. It is best that you not use these over a long period of time. - Many aspects of cancer therapy, including chemo and radiation therapy, pain killers and sedatives, reduce muscular contractions in the intestines, resulting in constipation. Sometimes physical assistance is needed. Using the flat side of your fist, gently massage with rocking motions, pushing about 1-2 inches. Be gentle and slow! This not only helps reduce constipation, but increases muscle tone.",

Foods which have bright colors, strong flavors, or odors often have coal tar in them. (The FDA lists thousands of approved food additives. The more natural and unprocessed the food is, the less likely it is to have additives. Junk foods are the worst.) - Research has shown that cyclamates, an artificial sweetener, will in later years cause cancer of the stomach and other digestive organs. Ditto for saccharin. - Food additives like MSG, BHT, BHA, DES, and others are poisons. Read the labels carefully. Keep in mind that many harmful food additives are not listed on the labels because the FDA considers them to be \"Generally Regarded as Safe\" Those chemicals you will find in the FDA GRAS List. But that does not mean they are safe! - Diethylstilbestrol (Des) has been shown by the FDA to cause cancer of the uterus, breast and other reproductive organs. This is an artificial sex hormone widely used in food production. Dangerous residues of stilbestrol are in 85% of all the meat sold in the United States. This is the main reason why 15 countries around the world now refuse to import American meat; 21 nations have a total ban on the use of stilbestrol in food production or processing. - Nitrosamines cause cancer of the liver, stomach, brain, bladder, kidneys and several other organs. Dr. William Lijinski, of the University of Nebraska, says they are \"perfect carcinogens.\" When chemical preservatives and color enhancers are ingested, they cause the body to produce nitrosamines. Another source is nitrates and nitrites, which are heavily added to meat during processing. Runoff of nitrates and nitrites from fields sprayed with chemical fertilizers get into aquifers and wells and, when the water is drunk, can lead to cancer. - Yes, aluminum cookware is a type of \"food additive!\" Throw it all away. It is poisonous to your body. It is outlawed in Sweden; outlaw it in your kitchen. Aluminum is a poison, and also a relatively soft metal. Particles of it gradually melt into the food you are cooking. That is why it remains so shiny inside! - Use only stainless steel or glassware for cooking. - Be very careful that you rinse all the soap off your dishes and pots, or you will have added an additional chemical \"food additive\" to your next meal.",

Widely used in maternity and other hospital wards, as well as in cosmetics and deodorants, \"hex\" is a powerful cancer producer. - Chemicals encourage the formation of free radicals in the body, which may lead to cancer. Do not be around or use chemicals. The body has to work to throw off the chemicals, when it should be attacking the cancer cells. - Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzidines, aniline dyes, and napthalenes, tends to promote development of bladder and kidney cancer. - Exposure to asbestos, nickel, chromates, pesticides, herbicides, and radioactive materials induces lung cancer. - Aflatoxins (found especially in peanuts and soy sauce) must be avoided. - Avoid amines (which are in cheese, meat, and unrefrigerated foods). - Antibiotics predispose to cancer. This would include tetracycline, penicillin, aspirin, diuretics, immunosuppressants, Azolid, Butazolidin, Presamine, Tofranil, Sk-Promine, Tapazole, Methotrexate, antihistamines, amphetamines, Atromids, etc. - Aspirin inhibits lymphocytes (white blood cells) which are crucially needed in immunological defenses. - No medicinal drugs ever healed anything; it is nature which heals. Drugs are given to shock the body into healing itself. A poison is introduced, and this rouses the body to a supreme effort to throw off the poison. The result is generally a weakening of body organs, a transfer of the site of disease to a different location, and sometimes a smothering of symptoms—till a later, more deadly, form emerges. - The taking of birth control pills, estrogen, and other female hormones is damaging to the body. A later result can be cancer. One anticancer physician (Gerson) found that the only cancer patients he could not recover were those who were taking hormones or who had damaged livers. - The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported (May 1972) that pregnant women who take hormones can result in cancer in their daughters when they enter their teens. The rate of leukemia rate is highest in affluent areas, where medical help can be afforded and lowest among poorer people. - City living is depressing. It is also unhealthful. The carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other photochemical pollutants in city smog definitely cause cancer of the lungs. Smog is somewhat present in rural areas, but the thickest in the cities where it is especially produced. - Automobile exhausts and phosphate fertilizers produce cadmium. This trace mineral is very toxic in larger amounts and produces various diseases, including cancer. Cadmium is concentrated in animal livers and shellfish. Avoid both of them.",

But is this really true? - It is not easy to arrive at clear-cut answers in this debate, but certain facts should be mentioned: - First, some sunlight on your skin is extremely important as a purifying agent. An entire book has been written about the physical benefits of obtaining some sunlight on your body. - Second, you need some sunlight in order to obtain enough vitamin D for your bones. The oils just below the surface layers of skin are irradiated by sunlight and vitamin D is produced. - Third, the author of that special book, Sunlight, by Zane Kime, M.D., is the recognized world authority on the subject—and in a special section on cancer, he provides 25 pages of detailed information about suntans in relation to skin cancer. - Kime declares that sunlight does not cause skin cancer, if the diet is correct! Here, briefly, are several of his points: - Sunlight can change cholesterol near the skin surface into free radicals, which can cause cancer. But a good diet will eliminate the free radicals. - A high-fat diet increases the likelihood of skin cancer. This includes too much oil of any kind in the diet—grease, hydrogenated oil, trans-fat, and vegetable oil. - Trans-fat (fat which is not polyunsaturated) stops oxygen utilization by the cell, and leads to cancer. Liquid vegetable oil can be up to 6% trans-fat, margarines up to 54%, and solid shortening up to 58%. - If you are on a low-fat diet, sunlight hitting your skin actually inhibits cancer.",

They are high in laetrile, an anticancer agent (although not as high as apricot seeds). - Do not eat peanuts. Limit, but do not eliminate soybean products. Soybeans contain enzyme inhibitors, so are not the best until you are well. - Eat all concentrated protein at only two meals (breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner). Do not eat them at the third meal. In this way there are no proteins being digested for a 15-hour period, and the pancreatic enzymes are able to focus their attention on digesting cancer cells present in everyone. - Overeating on protein leaves no extra pancreatic enzymes to digest cancer cells throughout the body. - Make sure you have enough hydrochloric acid, so the protein you do eat is being properly absorbed.",

But far more often, when cancer strikes, those eating the junk foods are also eating meat. - Nations and groups which consume less meat have less cancer. Hospital records show that Seventh-day Adventists, who eat little or no meat, suffer far less from cancer than the average meat-eating American. Dr. Willard J. Visek, research scientist at Cornell University, stated that the high protein diet of Americans is linked to the high incidence of cancer in the U.S. - Another cancer physician, who also worked with hundreds of cancer patients, said that anyone who does not eat meat, eats only good food, and does all he can to protect his liver, may never get cancer. - Cancer is less a disease than a condition existing in the whole body. Cancer would be almost unheard of if no devitalized food or meats were eaten. Cancer cannot exist where there is a pure bloodstream.",

    "content_en": "- Keep the weight down. Obesity is another factor linked to cancer, especially in women. Overweight women more frequently have cancer of the uterus, and do not recover as easily from breast cancer. - Accumulated fatty tissue in the body affects female hormones. The more that is present, the more estrogen is produced and converted into a special type of endocrine substance which stimulates cells to divide in the breast and reproductive system. Overweight men and women are more likely to develop cancer. - A high-fat diet dramatically increases the occurrence of colon, breast, endometrium, and ovarian cancer, as compared with a low-fat diet. Eating a lot of fat encourages the development of cancer in both men and women. Colon cancer is more likely to occur in men. - Those who eat the most saturated fat are twice as likely to develop polyps. - Dr. Ott Warburg, made that discovery in the 1920s. He demonstrated that the metabolism of cancerous tissue differs radically from that of normal tissue. A regular cell is nourished by oxygen which it uses to break down nutriments; without oxygen it dies. But a cancer cell lives by using chemicals to break down nutriments—not oxygen—and needs little or no oxygen to exist. The tumor, being a parasite, has a restricted circulation of blood, sometimes as low as 2% of normal, hence it lives on fermentation of sugar, like a plant or fungus, instead of oxygen. Later experiments by Warburg revealed that normal living tissue will become cancerous, if deprived of oxygen. It was this research which brought Warburg the Nobel Prize. - Since the blood provides the cells with oxygen, Warburg concluded that the condition of the bloodstream played an important part in the development of cancer. This is substantiated by the fact that malignant tumors are frequently found near scars, at the sides of ulcers, in atrophied organs, or wherever the blood supply is poor. - Rancid oils and heavy protein diets thicken the blood, and weaken its ability to transport food and oxygen to the cells. - Unlike other cells, cancer cells do not need oxygen. Rancid oils and fats are dangerous, for they decrease oxygenation and weaken normal cells while strengthening cancerous ones. - Rancid food and oils are unsafe and can produce cancer. Even health foods which have been on the shelf (not refrigerated) for too long can be rancid. Try to make sure that the wheat germ, wheat germ oil, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flaxseed oil, and whole wheat flour are fresh. Natural, unprocessed foods are extremely perishable. Refrigerate as soon as possible after purchasing them. Wheat germ is a special problem; it turns rancid a week after it is made. Vitamins E, A, and F are totally destroyed in rancid foods. During the process of turning rancid, very harmful chemicals, such as peroxides, are produced. Because they are strong chemical irritants, after being ingested they can cause cancer. Research on this was done in Germany by Dr. H. Anemueller, and, in the University of Pennsylvania, by Drs. Rownee and Barrett. - Heated fats (animal or vegetable), when heated to a high temperature, become carcinogenic. Never fry food, never eat fried food. Instead add no oil to your cooking, but place measured amounts on your food after it is served at the table. In this way, you will be better able to control your oil intake. - Oil in the coffee bean turns rancid when heated; do not drink coffee because of that and several other reasons. Coffee has been shown to produce cancer of the bladder.",

Too much cooked foods throw an extra burden on the pancreas. It must try to produce additional enzymes to detoxify that cooked food, which tries to produce a normal output of the same enzymes used throughout the body to destroy cancer cells. - When you do cook, measure the water and keep track of the time needed to cook the food—so that you will know exactly when to turn off the fire, and there is only a very small amount of water remaining in the pot. Then be sure and drink that water. - It has been reported that cancer which has been controlled, starts returning if over 25% of the food is cooked and processed. This is probably due to the extra demand on the pancreas to replace enzymes destroyed by heat. This paragraph is worth remembering later on. - Cook all sprouts slightly to eliminate a certain enzyme.

The use of alcohol or tobacco leads to cancer of the larynx. Smokeless tobacco produces cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, and throat. Smoking cigarettes or cigars produces lung cancer and is a factor in bladder and kidney cancer. - Do not eat too much salt. Research in Japan disclosed that the frequency of stomach cancer is definitely related to the quantity of salt eaten. - Caffeine also interferes with production of those enzymes. - Cancerous tumors require sugar in order to grow. Older women who use generous amounts of sugar are much more likely to contract breast cancer. Do not use any cane sugar products, such as cake, pie, jelly, ice cream, candy, etc. - In animal studies, progressive increase in sucrose in the diet leads to a dose-dependent decline in antibody production. - An epidemiological study of 21 countries revealed that high sugar intake is a major risk factor toward breast cancer. - Artificial sweeteners are cancer-causing drugs. - Do not use China tea (the regular tea you buy in the grocery store); it contains tannic acid. Only use herbal teas. - Some natural-remedy cancer therapists say never use tomatoes at all, if you have cancer. There is something about tomatoes that tend to aggravate the situation for those with active cancer. - Others say that those with cancer can eat tomatoes by themselves, not with other foods. Some say it is all right to make a meal of them if you wish—eaten alone. Some say they can be eaten with fresh-baked zwieback (bread which has then been toasted in the oven until it is hard and chewy). Probably the best decision is avoid tomatoes entirely if you have a malignancy. - Do not take supplemental iron tablets. The body tries to withhold iron from cancer cells, because the inorganic iron helps the cancer grow. People with excess iron levels in the blood tend to have an increased risk of developing cancer, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Excess iron suppresses the cancer-killing function of the macrophages and interfere with T- and B-cell activity. The richest source of good iron is blackstrap molasses. - Cancer thrives on glucose. They produce a 3- to 5-fold increase in glucose uptake compared to healthy cells. Studies of cancer patients revealed that they tended to eat more sugar than healthy people. It was also found that high sugar intake increases the likelihood breast cancer. - Simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose [white sugar]) honey, and orange juice significantly impaired the capacity of neutrophils to engulf bacteria, but starch ingestion did not have this effect. However, you still need simple sugars, so eat them in moderation.",

Only nutritious foods should be eaten, and in moderation. - Overeating is associated in 35% of all cancers. - One group of mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted (about 3 g per day); the other was restricted to 2 g. Over half the mice on the unrestricted diet developed cancer after 90 weeks. Later experiments repeated this result, producing all types of tumors (lung, liver, skin, etc.). In every experiment, the more the diet is restricted in calories, the less incidence of cancerous growths. - Carotenoids and bioflavonoids are both free radical protectors. Both stimulate the immune system, while there is evidence that carotenoids may be directly toxic to tumor cells. Carotenoids are the yellow coloring matter in green and yellow vegetables. Deep green leafy vegetables and fresh carrot juice are the best sources. Bioflavonoids are found in citrus, whole grains, honey, and other plant foods. - Animals fed cruciferous vegetables had markedly lower cancer rates matched controls. This family of vegetables includes broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. Of them, broccoli has been found to be the best. Since that 1970 discovery the University of Minnesota, the active ingredient, called indoles, have been isolated from the vegetables is provides unusual protection against cancer. Scientists at Johns Hopkins found that lab animals fed cruciferous vegetables, and then exposed to the deadly carcinogen aflatoxin, had a 90 percent reduction in cancer rates. - Greens and the green foods have every known vitamin, except Vitamin D and, possibly, B12. In addition, they have high levels of beta-carotene, potassium, glutathione (an amino acid) and other crucial nutrients which reduce tumor growth. - A diet high in beta-carotene, especially beta-carotene, has been found to protect against cancer (International Journal of Cancer, September 1984). - Green powders, such as Greenlife, Barley Green, etc., are invaluable. Eat a spoonful with your food or in juice. - Emphasize raw food to the degree you are able to do so. It is best that most of the food be raw, especially fruits and green leafy vegetables. - Phytosterols are natural chemicals in plants which reduce the risk of colon cancer. - Abscisic acid is a plant dormancy hormone and vitamin A analog found in plants; it has profound anticancer activity. Abscisic acid is a carotenoid factor and is especially found in green leafy vegetables. - While cleaning the body (such as during a fast), breakfast can consist of fresh fruit and fruit juices. Use lemon, orange, grape, carrot, beet, and apple juice daily. All juices should be fresh, with no sugar added. - But in other foods, a small amount of blackstrap molasses, pure maple syrup, or honey can act as a natural sweetener in place of sugar. - Use whole wheat or rye in place of white flour. Whole grain products, well-baked, are good. Do not use sourdough bread, sugared bread, or fruit breads. They are too indigestible. - Raw fruit and vegetables are best; lightly cooked or steamed are second best. Salt-free frozen are next. Then comes salt-free canned; but such food should only be used if the first three choices are not available. - Raw fruit and vegetable juices are needed to clean the system and help rebuild it. Use red beet juice (from roots and very little if any from tops) and juice from carrots, celery, grapes, and other darker vegetables and fruits, such as black cherries, black currants, etc. - Fruit juices are best taken in the morning and vegetable juices in the afternoon and evening. - Drink spring or steam-distilled water only! - Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer researcher, uses fresh raw cabbage and carrot juice with excellent results. - Some recommend four 8-ounce glasses of freshly squeezed juice daily. Max Gerson, M.D., prescribed 13 glassfuls a day. Along with a scientific program of other remedies, that juice pattern is still followed today at the Gerson Institute in northern Mexico. - Never mix fruit and vegetable juices in the same meal. It is all right to mix vegetables juices together, but do not mix fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, or grape). Some (including the Gerson Institute) recommend a combination of carrot and apple juice. - Fresh lemon juice should be squeezed on all greens, salads, or lettuce that are eaten. This enables the calcium and minerals to be better absorbed by the system. Dark green vegetables are better than lightcolored lettuce. - Lecithin should be included in the diet to keep cholesterol in the blood stream emulsified (so it does not harden on the walls). This will improve blood circulation to the site of the tumor. Lecithin helps regulate metabolism, break down fat and cholesterol, and prevent malignancies. - Wheat germ oil is an extremely rich source of vitamin E, and should be taken daily. Only use coldpressed (Viobin), and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to use it during the meal. - Omega-3 fatty acids may inhibit cancers, especially breast cancer (Cancer, October 1986). Flaxseed oil is, by far, the best source! - According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate amount of essential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancer. It even helps eliminate them, once they form. - Take a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses at the end of the vegetable meal. This will provide additional amounts of iron, calcium, and important B vitamins. - Never eat fruit and vegetables at the same meals. Exception: lemon juice can be squeezed over greens to help you better absorb and calcium and minerals in those greens. - Use plenty of soaked figs, prunes and raisins. - Eat garlic daily. Studies done in Japan suggest that taking garlic supplements may help reduce the size of tumors. It has been used for medicinal purposes for 4,000 years. - Garlic is a faithful standby, and …",

    "content_en": "You should be aware of the fact that, by the time symptoms of pain accompany cancer, it is in the advanced stages. At that point, the body urgently needs good nourishment, as well as cleansing; it should not be given fasts. For further information on this, see the Gerson Therapy, later in this book. But, as a cancer preventative, occasional fasting is helpful. Cancer prevention is theme of this entire Part One section of this book. - Fasts on fruit and vegetable juices of 1 to 3 days can be taken. If under the care of someone who knows what to do, and you are not thin, a longer fast may be undertaken. - Go on a fresh fruit diet for several days. If the patient is thin, after a few days of fruit diet, give him an alkaline nourishing diet. This would consist of vegetable broth (simmer thick potato peelings, carrots, and beets; strain; drink the water on top), mashed half-inch thick potato peelings, brown rice, carrots, greens of all kinds, red cabbage, parsley, and other vegetables. - Eating good food treats malnutrition, and many people develop cancer because of a lack of the protective, nourishing food needed to resist it. - There is a theory that you can starve cancer to death. This has been proven untrue. Cancer does better in a malnourished body. One study revealed that pure malnutrition (cachexia) is responsible for at least 22% and up to 75% of all cancer deaths.",

    "content_en": "IMPORTANT: Throughout this study, when dosage amounts used in research are given, the amounts are always for \"per day\" (mg per day, etc.) G means grams, not grains. IMPORTANT: According to the literature surveyed, when overdosage was possible, this was indicated. (See vitamins A, B6, niacin, selenium, cysteine, arginine.) Of course, vitamin D overdose can also be toxic, but it is not listed here as an anti-cancer factor. For a variety of reasons, beware of taking much, if any, iron supplements. IMPORTANT: Fish oils have also been recommended in the literature as possible anti-cancer agents. But we do not list them here for three reasons: Large amounts must be consumed to be beneficial. Fish oil has a known history of damaging the muscle of the heart. Some forms inhibit blood clotting Take the supplements, which seem distasteful and hard to swallow, and put them in a fruit or other drink and swallow them all together. If necessary, briefly whiz the mixture in a blender. When possible, chew the tablets. Break open the capsules and pour the powder onto your food or into a spoon. Crack liquid capsules in your mouth, and spit out the capsule. Do not crack vitamin C in your mouth—the acidity can hurt your teeth. Just swallow it whole. - It is well-known, by biochemists, that most cancer victims have a deficiency of not only all vitamins, but also hydrochloric acid, potassium, magnesium, iodine, and many trace elements. - Vitamins are very important. Do not trust yourself to the official standardized amounts of needed vitamins and minerals. The actual nutritional requirements are much higher. In addition, living in our chemicalized, polluted age destroys a number of vitamins and minerals. - For example, vitamin C is destroyed in its effort to combat auto exhaust fumes and mercury in the food. Vitamin E destroys itself in the process of detoxifying cadmium (which nonsmokers breath in when they are in the same room as smokers). The list goes on and on. The world is not as safe now as it used to be. We can be thankful that we are aware of vitamins and minerals and how to obtain them in sufficient quantities. [Special note: The following data on vitamin A was compiled from information gleaned from sources which had not yet discovered that beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) was the more active agency in cancer prevention, and far more powerful than vitamin A.] - Vitamin A is crucial in cancer therapy, but can you get too much of this oil-soluble vitamin? High doses of vitamin A (500,000 IU) can have acute reversible effects. Toxicity may start as low as 25,000 IU in those with impaired liver function (caused by drugs, hepatitis, or protein malnutrition) Otherwise, it begins at several hundred thousand IU. - Toxicity of vitamin A can be reduced by taking vitamin E at the same time. This mitigates lipid peroxide effects. - Toxicity of beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A, as found in greens and carrot juice) has never been found. One 15-year study involved immense beta-carotene intake. - Experiment after experiment has revealed that when vitamin A is missing, cancer can be started in animals; but, when it is present in abundance, not even fast growing implanted cancers will not survive in test animals. Vitamin A inhibits the induction and retards the growth of both malignant and nonmalignant tumors. Taken over a short period, vitamin A can greatly aid in recovery of cancer. Take large doses (up to 150,000 units per day or you may wish to remain with smaller doses: 50,000 units, twice a day). Later you can reduce this to a smaller amount. - Take vitamin A in emulsified form to minimize liver involvement. Alternate, taking it 2 weeks on and 1 weeks off. Blurred vision and a soapy feeling in the mouth are signs that the body has too much A. (Vitamin A and D, which are oil soluble, can be taken in excessive amounts, so one must always be careful. Never take large amounts of either for too long a time.) - In some instances, a person needs to take as much as 300,000 IU of vitamin A. When this must be done, taking 3200 IU of vitamin E will help reduce the risk of vitamin A toxicity. - Vitamin A derivatives (retinoids) reverse bronchial metaplasia. - Vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene reduce the risk of cancer by radiation and chemical carcinogen exposure. Vitamins A,D. and E inhibit oncogenes activity. - Varying amounts of Vitamin A were given to different patients with bladder cancer. Those receiving the smallest dosages were the most likely to have recurring cancer (i.e., the cancer return later). - The B-complex vitamins help prevent cirrhosis of the liver. This is important because a damaged liver has a 60% greater chance of becoming malignant. Dr. Max Gerson found that to be consistently true. Take a B-complex supplement. Also take 3-4 tablespoons of brewer's yeast each day. Do not eat baker's yeast; it contains live yeast and is not good for you. - Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner and director of the Max Plank Institute in Berlin, declared that there is a lack of one or more of three B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid) in tissue which becomes cancerous. - In various countries, nearly 200 scientists have reported on the importance of niacin (vitamin B3) in preventing and treating cancer. - 2 grams of Niacin (B3) daily is recommended as an anti-cancer factor. - Niacin has been recommended by the NIH in amounts up to 3000-6000 mg, for lowering cholesterol. But time release niacin is more suspect of causing liver damage; amounts which might do this were not given. - Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal with pyridoxal-5-pyrophosphate (P5P) is helpful in reducing damage from radiation therapy and slowing cancer growth from polyamine synthesis of the tumor. Especially good when a B6 ointment is applied to surface melanoma tumors. It helps prevent respiratory and cervical cancer (Nutrition and Cancer, June 1984). - B6-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor susceptibility and increased tumor size. In …",

    "content_en": "- A Cancer Control Convention, meeting in Japan, reported that the trace mineral, germanium, in the diet is a significant factor in preventing and eliminating cancer. - One cancer researcher, who studied in-depth into cancer remedies over the past 150 years, declared that every effective anticancer formula (Glyoxylide, which is the Koch treatment; the Hoxsey herbs; Hypotonic therapy; laetrile; the Gerson method; Krebiozen; and Carcalon) involves extra amounts of potassium. This is very important. - Be sure to include a significantly higher intake of potassium. Potassium deficiency is considered by Gerson, Scott, and others as a primary contributing cause of cancer. - Potassium foods include almonds, apples, dried apricots, bananas, beans, beets, broccoli, carrots, dulse, grapes, kale, olives, pecans, rice bran, sunflower seeds, wheat bran, and germ. These foods help the body resist and overcome tumors, cysts, and malignancies. - Center your diet around potassium foods. Here are more of them: - Dried apricots, asparagus, pearled barley, dried navy beans, fresh lima beans, raw beets, sprouted bread with no salt, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, caraway seed, cauliflower, celery seed, small leaves of chard, dark raw cherries, dandelion greens, dill seed, endive, unsulphured figs (dried or raw), garlic, concord or emperor grapes, grapefruit, fresh horseradish, fresh lemons, lentils, fresh limes, nectarines, okra, onions, oranges, fresh parsley, dried or raw peaches, Bartlett pears, dry or fresh peas, persimmons, raw pineapple (never canned), raw plums, dried or raw prunes, raw quinces, raisins, wild or brown rice, sage, rolled oats, spinach, squash (acorn, Hubbard, yellow summer), tangerines, raw tapioca, raw turnip leaves, and watermelon. - Drink potassium broths daily. Prepare them from half-inch thick potato peelings, which are then cooked. Draw off the water and drink it. - You want foods which are high in iodine and potassium, low in sodium, protein, and fat. - Potassium ascorbate (12-20 g) can be taken as a partial potassium supplement. This product includes vitamin C. - Potassium and magnesium are among the more crucial minerals for cancer recovery. Magnesium helps to stabilize cell membranes and elevate immune activity while potassium plays a critical role in membrane permeability. (Magnesium, 400-800 mg daily from aspartate, citrate, or orotate.) - Magnesium protects against cancer in general (Medical Hypotheses, August 1980). - Calcium and magnesium have a beneficial effect in helping the body resist colon cancer. Natural iron supplements help prevent thyroid cancer. (But many iron supplements are dangerous! Take blackstrap molasses instead of iron pills.) - The New England Journal of Medicine reported that calcium may prevent precancerous cells from becoming cancerous. Calcium protects against colon cancer (American Journal of Epidemiology, September 1988). - Calcium supplements (2000 mg) provide a marked suppression of rectal cancer proliferation. It inhibits early stages of colon cancer in genetically vulnerable individuals. - Iodine and trace minerals are crucial. You can obtain them by each day eating some Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp. Both are special seaweeds which have a wide spectrum of trace minerals. Food grown on the continents does not have all those trace minerals; rainwater has gradually depleted the soils. - Iodine protects against breast cancer (Lancet, April 1976). - It is very important to keep the iodine level of the blood normal, so both the thyroid and body tissues will have proper cell oxidation. Eat a sufficient amount of dulse, or kelp, each day. (Do not use California kelp.) - People with myxedema, or underactive thyroids, are more prone to developing cancer. So keep your thyroid in good condition with seaweed. - Japan and Iceland both have low goiter and breast cancer rates. This may be because their diets are rich in iodine and selenium. Breast cancer has been linked to an iodine deficiency. Japanese women have almost no breast cancer. Colon cancer rates in Japan are also low. - Studies at the University of Zurich and in London Polytechnic revealed that brewer's or food yeast gives improved resistance against cancer development. Brewer's yeast is one of the best sources of selenium, an important anticancer mineral. - Selenium made the headlines, at the end of 1996, as a special trace mineral which could dramatically reduce cancer in the human body. It completely inhibited tumor growth in mice inoculated with tumor cells. - Selenium helps eliminate cancer in five ways: It improves detoxification, bolsters immune function, directly toxic to tumor cells, and may is a valuable anti-proliferative factor (Lancet, July 1983). Selenium intake should not exceed 2500 mcg (2.5 mg) per day. - Using selenium as a sole therapy, there was a 38.8% favorable response rate in patients with oral cancer. - High doses of selenium (equivalent to 54 mg in humans) resulted in 83-90% reduction in rate of tumor growth in mice. - Long-term usage of 5000 mcg of selenium may result in fingernail changes and hair loss. Selenite is more toxic than selenium bound to amino acids (i.e., selenomethionine). Ingestion of 1-5 mg/kg body weight of selenite will produce toxic side effects. This is equivalent to 65,000 mcg in a 65 kg adult. - Chromium as picolinate is very helpful in working with carcinoma. (400-800 mcg.) - Zinc as zinc picolinate (30-100 mg) is also a significant help. It protects against prostrate cancer (British Journal of Urology, October 1983). - Cesium is neither essential nor toxic in cancer reduction. But it slightly alters the pH of cancer cells, rendering them more vulnerable to immune attack.",

It creates an environment unfavorable to bacterial growth. - A diet rich in chlorophyll is therapeutically effective for both external and internal infections, including malignancies. - Blue-green algae and chlorophyll clean and protect the blood - CoQ10 (co-enzyme Q10) and germanium provide oxygen to the cells. So does vitamin E, working in the liver. (Cancer does not use oxygen in the cells.) - CoQ10 increases aerobic (oxygen) metabolism and immune function. Cancer cells thrive where there is a lack of oxygen. - CoQ10 sometimes reduces hair loss in those who choose to take chemotherapy. - Scientists, at UCLA, have found that sodium linoleate, which contains linoleic acid (an essential fatty acid) has the ability to fight cancer cells. Lecithin is a good source. - Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) can be taken as oil of borage, evening primrose, or black current seed. In purified form, up to 1.5 grams per day can be taken. - Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil (1-2 tsp. daily). Make sure that it was stored in the refrigerator at the health food store you purchase it from. Flaxseed oil becomes rancid very quickly, so purchase small bottles.",

Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, especially) increases the body's own production of glutathione peroxidase (GSH). - Cysteine (N-acetylcysteine) (1-2 grams) is an amino acid which enters into various detoxification systems in the body, helps bolster glutathione peroxidase activity, and can be converted in the body to glutathione, which may become GSH, a potent broad spectrum anti-oxidant enzyme system. Cysteine supplementation promote glutathione synthesis. - Although safe up to 10 g, the nauseating taste and smell of cysteine can cause vomiting. - Several studies confirm that arginine reduces tumors and tumor formation. It increases T-cell function, stimulates the thymus and thyroid, and enhances activity of killer cells, as well as interleukin-2 receptors and general immune improvements. - At therapeutic levels (above 5 g) of arginine, growth of certain viruses may be activated. - Methionine reduces the uptake of mercury, which is a cancer-causing agent. - Malnourished cancer patients improve when branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are given. Protein and albumin synthesis are heightened.",

    "content_en": "The information in this section is primarily for medical researchers, but it is also invaluable for those who want to prevent cancer from gaining a foothold in their bodies. Because of modern nutritional, environmental, and living conditions, cancer rates are rapidly increasing. In this chapter, the thoughtful reader will have learned a number of things which can help prevent the occurrence of cancer. - You have been a toxic waste site! And now, before the cancer has a chance to start, you are beginning waste disposal operations. With prayer, diligent work, and the blessing of God, you can have success. - While some are concerned with treating symptoms, you must be concerned with getting at the causes of cancer and eliminating them. Only then can the problem be permanently solved. The Gerson Therapy seems to do the best job of eliminating the toxins. You will find it discussed later in this book. - Well, there you have a number of possible suggestions. What you have just read may seem like a lot of work. But, since cancer will generally mean the end of you, are you sure you do not want to work? - It is extremely important that you care for and rebuild the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, bowels, and other organs. Dr. Max Gerson maintained that he could eliminate cancer in anyone if the liver was in good condition. Take care of your liver. - If you have cancer, we recommend that you locate a physician and place yourself under his care. A careful, systematic regime of healthful recovery is needed, and you may not know what to do. Regardless of which doctor you go to, while waiting for appointments get started doing the right things! Doctors may be busy, but your life depends on changes which need to start right now. Essentially everything, listed here in Part One of this book, you can do at home to improve health and help prevent malignancies. - Do not fear. Trust your life to God; obey the Ten Commandments by faith in Christ; and step forward, living your best and doing your best. Entrust the outcome to God. - America alone spends $800 billion yearly on physicians and hospitals; yet it is 23rd in the world in level of health, vitality, and longevity. Surely, it is time that we start thinking for ourselves. - All information in this section, and throughout this book, is offered purely for educational, research, and experimental purposes—as an objective report, not as a recommendation or endorsement.
