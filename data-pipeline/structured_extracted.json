These last ten are provided to widen, to\nfull width, the number of problems which you can use herbs to deal with.\nBut in all your work with herbs, keep in mind that rest, fasting, a light nourishing diet, and some water\ntreatments are far more important than herbal remedies in treating most illnesses.\nFalse\nBlessed\nunicorn\nthistle\nMarshmallow\nBlue cohosh\nroot\nBuckthorn\nRue\nGentian\nUva ursi\nGinseng\nWhite willow\nBASIC HERBAL PRINCIPLES\n1 - Storage: Herbs are best stored in glass jars. Do not expose them to the sunlight for long periods of\ntime.\n2 - Weight factor: Larger persons require larger dosages than smaller or underweight individuals.\nWomen generally require smaller doses than men, due to their lower average weight. Children and\nelderly people need smaller doses.\n3 - Climate: The medicinal effect of herbs is intensified in hot climates, therefore give less at such times.\n4 - People vary in their reactions: Some people are more intolerant to herbs than are others. It is best to\ninitially give a smaller dose and see what the effect is going to be. It is always safe to start with the\nsmaller child's dose, then build up to a larger dose if that seems best. Increase slowly, remaining on each\nlevel for 2-3 days, to observe for unusual reactions.\n5 - Dosage for children: Here is the formula: Divide 150 (the assumed average adult weight) by the\nchild's weight. Example: A child weighs 50 pounds. This is 1/3 of the adult (of 150 pounds.). Therefore\ngive him only a third of the regular dose.\n6 - During pregnancy: Women respond to herbs differently when they are pregnant. At such times, it is\nbest to give smaller herbal doses and observe response. Sometimes mild and nutritive herbs are best.\nSome herbs should not be given during pregnancy (including diuretics, purgatives, and emmenagogues;\nall of which are active in the pelvic area and should be avoided.)\n7 - Nervous people: Give them smaller doses than robust individuals.\n8 - High blood pressure: These people should avoid herbs that stimulate the heart or constrict the blood\ncapillaries and arteries (licorice root, ephedra, and lily of the valley are examples). But cayenne and\ngarlic can be used in normal amounts.\n9 - When herbs are combined: Herbs are frequently combined; but, if not done properly, one herb may\noverpower or neutralize the effects of others.\n10 - Laxative herbs: Give slow-acting laxatives in the morning, so not to disturb sleep. They may take 13 days to work; whereas fast-acting ones usually take 4-8 hours. Do not increase the dosage until a 3-day\nperiod is over, using the same dosage every day. Then, if the desired result is not obtained, you may\nincrease the dosage. The desired objective is generally 2 bowel movements a day.\n11 - Sedatives and antispasmodic herbs: Give them on an empty stomach or just before bedtime.\n12 - Astringents and minerals: Astringent herbs should not be taken at the same time as nutritional\nsupplements containing iron. The tannins in astringent herbs will leach calcium, iron, and other\nimportant minerals out of the intestines. Therefore, only give astringent herbs for a short period of time.\n13 - Blood-purifying herbs: Take these herbs on an empty stomach.\n14 - Strong, bitter herbs: To avoid nausea, be sure and give enough water with them.\n15 - Powerful herbs: Be careful in giving herbs which have powerful effects. These include lobelia,\njuniper berries, black cohosh, poke root, aconite, and horsetail (shave grass).\n16 - Bitter pills: They have a tonic effect on the stomach, digestion, and related organs.\n17 - Herbal temperatures: A hot infusion or decoction is used to help induce sweating. Cool teas are\nused for tonic effect, and warm teas produce a feeling of relaxation. (Vervain is the best for inducing\nsweating.)\n18 - Tablets vs. capsules: Tablets are easier to work with than capsules in hot climates; the latter tend to\nstick together. Vegetarians either open and empty capsules or use tablets, since capsules are made from\nslaughterhouse products.\n19 - Herbs at mealtime: To avoid taking too much liquid, capsules or tablets are preferable to teas at\nmealtime.\n20 - Varying the intensity of the dosage: Here are several principles to keep in mind:\n- For a slow, gradual, general effect, give the herbs in small quantities of syrup or milk\nbetween meals. This will retard absorption.\n- To aid the appetite, increase digestive secretions or, for a local effect on stomach or\nintestines, give herbs before meals. Give the herbs in acacia gum or olive oil for a\nlocalized effect on stomach or intestines.\n- To reduce the irritation of certain herbs, give them in syrup or soy milk.\n- To increase absorption of the herbs and produce a more rapid effect, give them 1-2 hours\nafter the meal.\n- To reduce the bitter taste of herbs, without reducing the bitterness, take it in a large\nquantity of fluid, syrup, or honey. The bitter taste is often necessary for the proper effect\nto take place, but the bitterness can be disguised to the taste buds.\n- Fluids which do not taste good can be taken more easily by drinking them cold, followed\nby a drink of plain water.\n21 - Weekly rest day: In order for herbs to work best, they should not be taken one day each week. Then,\nafter 2-3 weeks of treatment, no herbs should be taken for 3 days in a row. During this rest period,\nobserve the patient. (1) If his energy remains low during that time or if the symptoms worsen, at the end\nof the rest period put him back on the herb dosage. (2) If he improves during the rest period, then extend\nthe rest period a day or so and then continue the treatment with smaller doses than were used before. (3)\nIf he seems to completely recover during the rest period, then the treatment can be changed to a more\ntonic, nutritive, approach. (4) New symptoms or problems may reveal themselves at this time. If so, an\nherb formula or new therapy should be instituted to meet it. (5) If he seems to get stronger during each\nrest period, begin reducing therapy and extending the rest periods.\nTHE PREPARATION OF HERBS\n1 - Infusion: Pour one pint of boiling water over one ounce of dried herbs and let it stand for a half hour.\nStrain off clear liquid. Dose is normally 1 tablespoon to a teacup, 3 times a day. But doses can vary.\n2 - Decoction: Place one ounce of dried herbs in 1½ pints of cold water and boil for 20-30 minutes.\nStrain off clear liquid. Dose is 1 tablespoon to 1 ounce of water, 3 times a day.\n3 - Tincture: 1-2 ounces dried herbs are steeped in one pint of grain alcohol (brandy or vodka) for 2\ndays with vigorous shaking 3 times a day. The decoction is strained and 1 tablespoon of the clear liquid\nis used, 3 times a day.\n4 - Capsule: The dry herbs are powdered and then placed in a 2-piece gelatin capsule. The capsule may\nbe added to hot water for tea; opened and made into a paste for poultices, tinctures, decoctions,\ninfusions; or swallowed.\n5 - Tablet: The dried herb is pressed into a tablet shape with an excipient (binder or carrier). The tablet\ncan be used in the same way as a capsule.\nNINE USEFUL POULTICES\n1 - Cabbage poultice: Pulverize the leaves and lay it on the skin. This will draw out poisons and pus.\nWhen it feels hot, replace it with a fresh one.\n2 - Garlic poultice: Crush fresh garlic and add warm water and flour. It relieves pain, pus, and infection.\n3 - Potato poultice: Place grated raw potato on bruises, sprains, or boils.\n4 - Comfrey poultice: Mash the leaves, then moisten them with comfrey tea. It is good for open sores,\nwounds, or swellings.\n5 - Fig poultice: Heat figs for 3 minutes, cut open, and apply to infected sores. It will bring them to a\nhead.\n6 - Oatmeal poultice: Cook oatmeal, cool, then place in a soft, cotton cloth. Put it over inflammations\nand insect bites, and cover with a dry cloth. Apply a heating pad.\n7 - Carrot poultice: Take the pulp remaining after juicing carrots (or finely grate carrots), and place it on\nbruises, sores, chapped skin, and nipples.\n8 - Tofu poultice: Squeeze out the cake, chop it up, add a teaspoon of ginger, then flour till it thickens.\nThis will draw out inflammation and fever.\n9 - Clay poultice: Get clay from a place where it is found and sterilize it in the oven. Or buy it at the\nhealth food store (either regular clay or bentonite clay). Mix the clay with just enough water or herb tea\nto make a consistency that is thick, like bread dough. Apply to bruises and infections. Mix clay with\ncrushed cabbage leaves, and place the mixture on boils or tumors. Mix clay with cayenne or ginger and\napply to sore arthritic joints.\nTHE HEALING CRISIS\nPhysicians and laymen have known about the healing crisis for thousands of years. During the healing\nprocess, the body tries to throw off toxins and poisons. What is known as the \"healing crisis\" frequently\noccurs in illnesses. The body seems overwhelmed with all the toxins and wastes it is trying to throw off.\nThe organs of elimination (bowels, kidneys, lungs, skin, nasal passages, throat, bronchi, and urinary\norgans) become congested, crowded, and irritated.\nDuring this crisis, that which appears to be disease symptoms appear. These may be open sores,\nperspiration, diarrhea, boils, colds, kidney and bladder infections, fevers, etc. But this is not a new, or\nintensified, disease—it is just part of the healing process. The body knows it must eliminate the wastes\nbefore it can begin rebuilding, so it works valiantly to do this.\nPhysicians sometimes try to stop the process by introducing poisons (drugs) into the system.\nImmediately, the body stops throwing off wastes—stops the crisis—and turns its attention to the terrible\nnew invader. The body may appear to be resting quietly now, with the symptoms reduced or gone; but,\nin actuality, it has been prostrated by the drugging.\nLet us now return to a healing crisis and its symptoms. They are part of the cure, and should not be\nfeared. Just work with the body, to help eliminate those toxic wastes. Open the channels of elimination\nby means of drinking water and fruit juices, fasting, enemas, colonics, showers, baths, and water\ntreatments.\nSometimes the pain becomes severe during the crisis. Drugs taken in earlier years are being pulled out of\nthe tissues in an effort to discard. The damage of many years is being righted.\nThe body arouses itself in self-defense and brings forth acute elimination of toxins in the form of a fever,\ncold, inflammations, itching, boils, ulcers, hemorrhages, excessive menstrual discharge, etc. Reactions\nvary, in accordance with how the person has been living and the condition of the body.\nBut sometimes this sudden turn in an illness is not a healing crisis, but a change for the worse in a\ndisease. It is important to be able to tell the difference. Consider this:\n- Watch the person carefully, as you work earnestly to help him eliminate toxins (water,\njuices, enemas, sweating, baths, etc.) If not watched properly and helped, the crisis can be\nextended and his energies weakened.\n- If it is a healing crisis, you will generally see a positive change—a change for the\nbetter—after three days. The most severe symptoms begin to decrease. Fevers break. The\nperson becomes more relaxed and begins to feel better.\n- But if, after three days, the symptoms do not change for the better, then a new course of\ntreatment must be started. However, if the person has low energy and vitality, the crisis\nmay take three to seven days.\n- If the individual has a strong constitution and the organs of elimination are working well\nand are being helped, he may recover without having undergone a healing crisis.\nAre there ways to tell when a healing crisis is about to begin? Certain symptoms will intensify, such as\nsluggishness, fevers, dark urine, coated tongue, weakness, irritability, headaches, and ringing in the ears.\nWhen you see these signs, immediately set to work to help the person's system cleanse more fully.\nHerbs, massage, water therapy treatments, and enemas can help him through this time.\nIf no poisons were introduced into the system (in an effort to block the healing crisis) the person will\ngenerally keep improving. Right living, right eating, and rest can bring healing.\nAdditional healing crises may occur before the patient is fully recovered. Each one will generally be\nmilder, only one to three days in length, and be followed by a new level of feeling better.\nThe intensity of the crisis will depend on how ill the person was. The nature of the crisis will be keyed to\nwhere the illness is centered in his body and how easily he can throw off the poisons.\nIf the wastes can be eliminated through normal pathways, a fever will develop to burn it out or store it as\nboils and acne. If the mucous is thick, there will be nasal drip, colds, flu, etc. Constipation may precede\ndiarrhea; lung congestion may come before a respiratory crisis.\nSometimes we feel pain in our kidneys, bladder, or bowels and imagine it is a disease. But, in fact, often\nthe body has selected the strongest organ of elimination to throw off unwanted and excess wastes.\nWhen the crisis is over, the body needs help rebuilding itself. But, throughout the sickness and recovery,\nnever go to extremes in diet. Carry on with a gradual transition back to regular living. Trying to make\nthe system too pure too fast can overly weaken the patient. Work carefully, keep praying for guidance;\nand, if the patient fully cooperates, all will go well.\nWATER THERAPY PRINCIPLES\nIt would be well to include instruction here on how to give simple water treatments; but, like herbal lore,\nit cannot be properly covered in a few pages. The present author wrote a 290-page book, entitled The\nWater Therapy Manual (see order sheet), which nicely covers the subject. You may obtain a copy, as\nlong as they are available.\nHere are but a few of the many water therapy principles:\n- It is the heat and cold of the water that produces the results. Neutral temperatures are\ngood for relaxing the person, but they do not produce the powerful effects that hot and\ncold can give.\n- Water is capable of absorbing and storing a larger amount of heat than nearly any other\nsubstance on earth; that is, it has a high specific heat. This means that, when water is\napplied to the body (in a cloth, bath, shower, etc.), it will impart more heat (or cold) than\nany other substance at the same temperature.\n- In its effects, ice is far colder than its temperature of 32o F., and steam is far hotter than\n212o F. (Keep in mind that steam can burn.)\n- Water must be in contact with the body for awhile in order to impart heat or cold. But it\nonly need contact it for a moment to give a thermic impression that can be quite strong.\nFor example, plunge your arm for only a moment into a pail of very cold water. It was\nonly there for a moment, but the effect on the circulating blood in the arm will be\npowerful. This is thermic impression, and it is very important. You do not have to cool the\nbody with lengthy cold in order to have it react strongly to that cold.\n- Water is the world's greatest solvent. It can cleanse better than anything else. It can\nremove wastes. But it can also hold nutrients placed within it for the body to absorb.\n- Neither infants nor aged persons bear cold treatment well. Some chill after almost any\nkind of cold application. Remember that they are only being helped if they react well to\nthe cold application. If they do not, then they are not being helped. Conditions which do\nnot react well to cold would include anemia, emaciation, asthenia, extreme thinness, etc. If\na person cannot be benefited by cold, then apply mild heat instead. Always keep the feet\nwarm.\n- The body should be warm before the cold is applied. He should become warm afterward.\nExercise, friction, percussion—all help bring a good reaction. Hot given beforehand to\nwarm the body also aids it. You may need to apply hot to the feet before the cold is given,\nand, if need be, afterward also.\n- The cold treatment should be given quickly. As soon as it is completed, quickly dry him.\nFriction as he is rubbed with the towel, or afterward, will also help warm him. He must be\ndried very quickly and well. Dry him in a warm room, near where the last cold application\nwas given. Have his clothes all ready for him to put on. This requires advance planning.\nCarelessness after the cold can undo all the value that could have been gained from it.\n- By alternating the hot and cold applications, the beneficial properties of both may be\nobtained without many of the disadvantages of either.\nAs you become acquainted with the many water therapies given in the author's book, The Water Therapy\nManual (see order sheet), you will notice that they tend to do one or more of six things:\n- Bring blood to an afflicted part. This will frequently be an area closer to the surface and\noutside of the trunk.\n- Pull blood from a deeper internal organ to the skin just above it. This deeper, congested,\narea is often in the trunk, and the hot application (or a cold-to-heating application) was\nplaced on the skin just above that organ.\n- Draw blood away from a deeper, congested, organ by placing the application, not on the\nskin just above the internal organ,—but on a reflex area somewhere else on the body.\n- Pull blood from the internal organ to a distant body part (usually the legs and/or\nfeet—best both). This is called derivation, and is frequently done at the same time that an\napplication is made just above the internal organ (or to a reflex area connected to it by\nnerves), to also pull blood away from that congested organ.\n- A proximal compress, consisting of a cold application, may be placed on an extremity.\nAn example would be an ice compress around the neck. This will greatly reduce the\namount of blood flowing into the head.\n- A full application to most of the body to relieve congestion, equalize the circulation, and\nbring warmth from that application (a hot pack, apply heat) or by reaction to it (a heating\ncompress, applying cold for the body to heat).\nThere are many additional guiding principles involved in the use of water therapy. Water is a most\nprecious gift from God. Make good use of it, in both sickness and in health.\nHYDRO—When HYDRO is shown at the beginning of a paragraph, it refers to water treatments in the\nauthor's hydrotherapy book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet). In case you do not have that book,\nthe name of the water treatments are given. But page numbers are also cited, so you can learn more\nabout how to give these applications if you have that book. Only a very small sampling of the water\ntreatments described in that book are mentioned in this one. Many more could have been included, but\nthis present book would have become too large.\nTHE USE OF DRUGS\nThe following analysis of the nature and effects of medicinal drug medication is taken from the writings\nof Ellen G. White, an influential author and worker in the field of health and natural healing.

When drugs are introduced into the\nsystem, for a time they seem to have a beneficial effect. A change may take place, but the disease is not\ncured. It will manifest itself in some other form . . The disease which the drug was given to cure may\ndisappear, but only to reappear in a new form, such as skin diseases, ulcers, painful diseased joints, and\nsometimes in a more dangerous and deadly form . . Nature keeps struggling, and the patient suffers with\ndifferent ailments, until there is a sudden breaking down in her efforts, and death follows.\"—How to\nLive, 60.\n\"Although the patient may recover, yet the powerful effort nature was required to make to overcome the\npoison, injured the constitution and shortened the life of the patient. There are many who do not die\nunder the influence of drugs, but there are very many who are left useless wrecks, hopeless, gloomy, and\nmiserable sufferers, a burden to themselves and to society.\"—How to Live, 50.\n\"Every additional drug given to the patient . . will complicate the case, and make the patient's recovery\nmore hopeless . . An evil, simple in the beginning, which nature aroused herself to overcome, and which\nshe would have done if left to herself, aided by the common blessings of Heaven, has been made tenfold\nworse by introducing drug poisons into the system, which cause of themselves a destructive disease,\nforcing into extraordinary action the remaining life forces to war against and overcome the drug\nintruder.\"—How to Live, 57.\n\"There are more who die from the use of drugs than all who would have died of disease had nature been\nleft to do her own work.\"—How to Live, 61.\n\"The endless variety of medicines in the market, the numerous advertisements of new drugs and\nmixtures, all of which claim to do wonderful cures, kill hundreds where they benefit one . . Yet people\nkeep dosing, and continue to grow weaker until they die . . God's servants should not administer\nmedicines which they know will leave behind injurious effects upon the system, even if they do relieve\npresent suffering. Every poisonous preparation in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, taken into the\nsystem, will leave its wretched influence, affecting the liver and lungs, and deranging the system\ngenerally.\"—Facts of Faith, 140.\n\"Educate away from drugs, use them less and less, and spend more and more upon hygienic agencies.\nNature will respond to God's remedies,—pure air, pure water, proper exercise, and a clear\nconscience.\"—Letter, 1888.\n\"A great amount of good can be done by enlightening all to whom we have access, as to the best means,\nnot only of curing the sick, but of preventing disease and suffering. The physician who endeavors to\nenlighten his patients as to the nature and causes of their maladies, and to teach them how to avoid\ndisease, may have up-hill work; but if he is a conscientious reformer, he will talk plainly of the ruinous\neffects of self-indulgence in eating, drinking, and dressing, of the overtaxation of the vital forces that has\nbrought his patients where they are. He will not increase the evil by administering drugs till exhausted\nnature gives up the struggle, but will teach the patients how to form correct habits and to aid nature in\nher work of restoration by a wise use of her own remedies.\"—Christian Temperance, 121.\n\"In treating the sick, the physician will seek God for wisdom; then, instead of placing his dependence\nupon drugs and expecting that medicine will bring health to his patients, he will use nature's restoratives,\nand employ natural means whereby the sick may be aided to recover.\"—Healthful Living, 247-248.\n\"Let the instruction be given in simple words [such as hot water, charcoal, or catnip tea]. We have no\nneed to use the many expressions used by worldly physicians which are so difficult to understand that\nthey must be interpreted by physicians . . Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving\nthe deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs.\"—Letter 82, 1908.\n\"Were I sick, I would just as soon call in a lawyer as a physician from among general practitioners. I\nwould not touch their nostrums, to which they give Latin names. I am determined to know, in straight\nEnglish, the name of everything that I introduce into my system.\"—Manuscript 86, 1897.\n\"Indulging in eating too frequently, and in too large quantities, overtaxes the digestive organs and\nproduces a feverish state of the system. The blood becomes impure, and then diseases of various kinds\noccur. A physician is sent for, who prescribes some drug which gives present relief, but which does not\ncure the disease. It may change the form of the disease, but the real evil is increased ten-fold. Nature was\ndoing her best to rid the system of an accumulation of impurities, and should she have been left to\nherself, aided by the common blessings of heaven, such as pure air and pure water, a speedy and safe\ncure could have been affected.\"—4 Spiritual Gifts, 133.\n\"Use nature's remedies,—water, sunshine, and fresh air. Do not use drugs. Drugs never heal; they only\nchange the features of the disease.\"—Letter 116, 1903.\n\"Experimenting in drugs is a very expensive business . . Nothing should be put into the human system\nthat will leave a baleful influence behind.\"—Medical Ministry, 228.\n\"Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by\nthose who use poisonous drugs. They destroy the power of the patient to help himself. This power the\npatients are to be taught to exercise by learning to eat simple, healthful foods, by refusing to overload\nthe stomach with a variety of foods at one meal. All these things should come into the education of the\nsick. Talks should be given showing how to preserve health, how to shun sickness, how to rest when rest\nis needed.\"—Letter 82, 1908.\n\"Christ's remedies cleanse the system. But Satan has tempted man to introduce into the system that\nwhich weakens the human machinery, clogging and destroying the fine, beautiful arrangements of God.\nThe drugs administered to the sick do not restore, but destroy. Drugs never cure. Instead, they place in\nthe system seeds which bear a very bitter harvest.\"—2 Selected Messages, 289.\n\"Thousands need to be educated patiently, kindly, tenderly, but decidedly, that nine-tenths of their\ncomplaints are created by their own course of action. The more they introduce drugs into the system, the\nmore certainly do they interfere with the laws of nature and bring about the very difficulties they drug\nthemselves to avoid.\"—Letter 22, 1889.\n\"Instead of taking a course to baffle disease, you are petting it and yielding to its power. You should\navoid the use of drugs and carefully observe the laws of health. If you regard your life, you should eat\nplain food, prepared in the simplest manner, and take more physical exercise. Each member of the\nfamily needs the benefit of health reform. But drugging should be forever abandoned. For while it does\nnot cure any malady, it enfeebles the system, making it more susceptible to disease.\"—5 Testimonies,\n311.\n\"If those who take these drugs were alone the sufferers, the evil would not be as great. But parents not\nonly sin against themselves in swallowing drug-poisons, but they sin against their children. The vitiated\nstate of their blood, the poison distributed throughout the system, the broken constitutions and various\ndrug diseases, as the result of drug poisons, are transmitted to their offspring, and left them as a\nwretched inheritance, which is another great cause of the degeneracy of the race.\"—How to Live, 53.\nSection 0\nPrinciples of Health\nPart 4a\nFirst Law of Health - Air\nTHE AIR YOU BREATHE\nThe year was 1875; the place, Paris, France. For more than two years, three scientists had worked\ntoward this day, and now they were ready. Carefully, they climbed into the gondola of the balloon,\n\"Zenith,\" while thousands around them watched.\nDetermined to set a new altitude record, they wanted to go higher than man had ever risen above the\nearth. And they did just that,—but at what a cost.\nSlowly the large balloon rose into the air, with its human cargo of three men in a basket-shaped gondola\nswinging just beneath it. All seemed well; they were well on their way toward the goal: to climb higher\nthan any man had ever gone.\nThen at 24,430 feet it happened. Tissandier, one of the three, later described it: \"Croce is gasping for\nbreath, Sivel is dazed, but can still cut three sandbags loose in order to reach 26,240 feet.\"\nAt that point, Tissandier himself was overcome and slumped to the floor, losing consciousness. Some\ntime afterward, as the balloon—freed from the sandbags continued its ascent—he awoke. They had\nattained a height of 8,600 meters (approximately 28,000 feet)—but two of the scientists lay dead in the\ngondola of the balloon. Yes, they had conquered the heights, but before it was done the heights had\nconquered them. There was not enough air, with its precious life-giving oxygen, to sustain life at that\ngreat altitude.\nWithout air, man dies. Air is the most vital element for man and animals. One may live for weeks\nwithout food, or for days without water, but deprived of air he will perish within minutes.\nMillions of people suffer from a wide variety of ailments that are partly caused by an insufficient supply\nof oxygen. The problem is that most people do not breathe correctly, and this continually weakens their",

Those who do so, may feel weaker for a\nfew days, but afterwards will generally feel much better and stronger.\n- Over-indulgence in sex is an excellent way to debilitate the body. Worry wears out the\nlife forces. The use of coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and processed and junk foods are also\nsources of trouble.\n- Trust in God, obey the Ten Commandments, and live as healthfully as you can.\n- A good program of better nutrition, more rest, less tension, and taking time to go\noutdoors and work or walk 30-60 minutes at a time will do much to build the body. A cold\nmorning shower invigorates the body.\n- As an aid in rebuilding the body after acute or chronic illnesses, the following herbal\nformula is quite helpful. It combines nutritional benefits with herbal tonics:\nMix together 1 oz. parsley root, 1 oz. alfalfa; 1/2 oz. of each of the\nfollowing: dandelion root, comfrey root, yellow dock root, burdock root,\nnettles leaves, and dulse. Place in an uncovered pot with a quart of water\nand simmer for 20 minutes. Let it cool, then strain. Place the liquid back in\nthe pot and simmer uncovered for one hour or until it is reduced to one cup.\nStir in one cup of unsulphured blackstrap molasses and refrigerate. Take\none tablespoonful 3 times a day.\n- A variant method would involve taking the powdered, mixed, dry herbs (not having gone\nthrough the cooking stage), place them in #00 capsules, and take 2-4 caps with each meal.\nHYDRO—Here are water treatments, explained in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet),\nwhich will increase endurance: Tonic frictions, which include Wet Hand Rub, Cold Mitten Friction,\nCold Towel Rub, Wet Sheet Rub, Dripping Sheet Rub, Ice Rub, and Salt Glow (WTM, pp. 97-105). In\ncases of severe exhaustion, bed rest for a time, proper diet, plus carefully graduated tonic cold\napplications, especially Percussion Douche to spine (p. 228).\nENCOURAGEMENT—No one understands as well as Jesus your problems.

Because the symptoms resemble flu and\nother viral symptoms, EBV is not always diagnosed correctly. In fact, it is frequently misdiagnosed as\nhypochondria, depression, or psychosomatic illness.\nCAUSES—Chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). This condition has\nbecome widespread in America. the CDC in Atlanta estimates that tens of thousands of people are\ninfected with it. Yet they are unaware of it since symptoms are frequently not prominent.\nThis virus is also the cause of infectious mononucleosis. When mononucleosis occurs, the person\nbecomes very ill for two to four weeks, or longer if the diet is not corrected. (See \"Mononucleosis.\")\nEBV is a type of herpes virus, and is related to the viruses that cause genital herpes and shingles.\nKeep in mind that chronic fatigue syndrome can also be caused by certain other factors: candida albicans\n(yeast infection), anemia, chronic mercury poisoning from dental amalgam tooth fillings, hypoglycemia,\ninsomnia, and hypothyroidism. (All of the above problems are dealt with in articles in this book.)\nOnce EBV is contracted, it always remains in the body. Fortunately, most people develop antibodies to\nit. The problem occurs when they become run-down and overworked—and then the dormant EBV\nstrikes. It is more likely to reveal its presence when other diseases are also present, such as arthritis,\nlupus, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or AIDS.\nEBV causes the body to overreact, resulting in a burn-out of the immune system.\nEpstein Barr virus is very contagious, and can be transmitted by close contact, kissing, sharing food,\ncoughing, and through sex.\nBlood tests for antibodies against candida albicans, EBV, HBLV and CMV are available for specific\ndiagnosis. Yet the fact remains that EBV symptoms are similar to those for many infections, anemia,\nparasites, endocrine diseases, and AIDS.",

Regularity in bowel movements are\nessential. Add fiber to the diet. Cleansing enemas should be used occasionally. Get plenty\nof rest. Do not overexert yourself with heavy exercise.\n- Remove from the diet all junk foods, processed foods, fried foods, stimulants (coffee,\ntea, soft drinks, sugar), and white flour products (bread, spaghetti, etc.)\n- It is said that 60 percent of those with EBV also have candida (see Candidiasis),\ntherefore it is best to eat some form of acidophilus. Eliminate sugar, alcohol, mushrooms\nand all fungi, molds and yeast, fermented foods such as sauerkraut, soy sauce, dry roasted\nnuts, potato chips, soda pop, bacon, pork, lunch meats, and all types of cheese.\n- Eat some brand of \"greens\" tablets. Chlorophyll is vital to proper diet and healing. Make\ngreen drinks from whizzed up greens and pineapple juice.\n- Take no aspirin, since it may induce Reye's syndrome (especially in children).\n- Helpful herbs include red clover to cleanse the blood, echinacea to help the glands, garlic\nas an antibiotic, and saffron to help reduce pain.\n—Also see \"Lyme Disease,\" which has similar symptoms. Also see \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The heart that has once tasted the love of Christ, cries out continually for a\ndeeper draught. How thankful we can be for His love and care over us.\nCANDIDIASIS (Yeast Infection, Candida, Thrush, Chronic Fatigue\nSyndrome)\nSYMPTOMS—Symptoms include bad breath, constipation, chronic infections, depression, fatigue,\nfood cravings, gas, headaches, adrenal and thyroid problems, hiatal hernia, indigestion, insomnia, mental\nconfusion, discomforting odors, panic attacks, and menstrual problems.\nCAUSES—This is an infection caused by candida albicans, a normally harmless yeast (saprophyte)\nfound in your intestines. Some of it is also regularly found in your mouth, throat, and genital tract. But\nthis organism goes wild when its competitors, the normal bacteria of the intestines, are killed by long\nterm use of antibiotics. This enables the candida to greatly increase in number.\nStress causes a reduced production of stomach acid, which lets candida enter the stomach—a place\nwhere it normally is never found. As a result, less digested food enters the intestines, much to the liking\nof the candida which feeds upon it.\nThis yeast-like substance proliferates so massively that it enters the blood stream and is carried to many\nparts of the body, weakening the immune system and causing various problems.\nIn the oral cavity, candida is called thrush. White sores may develop on the tongue, gums, and inside the\ncheeks.\nIn the vagina, it results in vaginitis. Large amounts of a white, cheesy discharge and intense itching\noccur.\nOther effects are food allergies, athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch, and even diaper rash.\nCandida is not transmitted sexually, but mothers may pass thrush on to their newborn children. The\nbaby's tongue will appear red and be covered with white spots (generally appearing 8-9 days after\ndelivery) that will appear like milk spots. On the buttocks, thrush may resemble diaper rash.\nBecause their vaginal environment is more conducive to the growth of yeast, diabetic women can\ncontract candida easier than diabetic men.\nYou may wish to request a blood test for antibodies against C. albicans. A skin test, similar to a TB tine\ntest, is also available. A positive result is clear-cut. Unfortunately, a negative one provides less certainty\nthat one does not have it. Candida is difficult to diagnose, since a culture cannot be used. This is because\nthis yeast is a normal constituent of everyone's intestines.\nTREATMENT—Try to eliminate food allergies, hypoglycemia, any infections, and indigestion.\n- Replant Lactobacillus acidophilus. This is the friendly intestinal bacteria which the\n\"wonder drugs\" earlier killed off. Lactobacillus is a primary competitor of candida for\nfood in the intestine. Use a retention enema containing 4 oz. warm water and 10 billion\norganisms (empty twenty 500,000 organism capsules into the water). Use 3 times weekly,\n10 minutes each time.\n- Helpful herbs include burdock, echinacea, ginger, golden seal, bee pollen, kelp, lobelia,\npassion flower, pau d'arco, psyllium, slippery elm, ginkgo, and suma.\n- Useful nutrients include vitamin B complex with extra biotin: 100 mg 3 times a day. /\nB12 lozenges: place 2,000 mcg lozenge under tongue 3 times a day between meals. /\nEssential fatty acids: Wheat germ oil, primrose oil, etc. / Garlic capsules: 2 caps 3 times a\nday. / Multivitamin cap, 2-3 times a day. Take vitamin C up to bowel tolerance.\n- Also helpful: vitamin A: 25,000 IU one to two times a day; B6: 100-250 mg one to two\ntimes daily; vitamin E: 400-800 IU daily; biotin; aloe vera juice: 2 oz. four times per day.\n- Do not use oral contraceptives while you have candida. Do not use sugary foods. Do not\nuse cheese, alcohol, chocolate, fermented food, gluten grains (wheat, oats, rye, and\nbarley). Do not use meat, pickles, raw mushrooms, vinegar, or any yeast products.\n- Yeast thrives on sugars and carbohydrates. A vegetarian nondairy diet of protein,\nunrefined grains, and vegetables is best. Onions and garlic are very helpful. Fresh, raw\ngarlic is the best. Avoid meat-based proteins, since these are associated with abnormal\nbowel flora development. Avoid yeasted grain foods.\n- Avoid antibiotics and steroids, because they destroy the competing bacteria and allow\ncandida to overgrow.\n- Wear cotton underpants, rather than close-mesh synthetic or silk.\n- An alternative to douching is the sitz (sitting) bath. Fill a shallow tub to the hip with\nwarm water, then add salt (enough to make the water taste salty, about 1/2 cup) to match\nyour body's natural saline state. Add 1/2 cup vinegar to help rebalance the vaginal pH to\n4.5. Then sit in the water, knees apart, until it gets cool. The bath will do the cleansing.\nDouching can be done with a similar mixture (4 teaspoons vinegar to 1 pint of water).\nINFANT THRUSH—Four percent of infants have oral thrush. Keep rubber nipples clean, as well as all\nobjects going into baby's mouth. If bottle-feeding, boil nipples and bottles 20 minutes after thorough\nwashing (candida spores are heat resistant). Give plain water to cleanse the mouth after every feeding.\nInspect the mouth before each feeding, and begin treatment if thrush is seen. Swab infected areas with\nsaturated solution of baking soda 3-4 times a day. Garlic overpowers candida, so it may be swabbed on\nthe lesions several times a day.\n—Also see \"Vaginitis,\" \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Our God delights to do abundantly above all that we ask or think. He will care\nfor you through this crisis. Trust Him and, by His enabling grace, obey His Scriptures.",

If you remain in the sun, even though resting and\ndrinking fluids, your temperature will continue to rise! Do not return to the sun for many\nhours!\n- In the early stages, drink large amounts of mineral-rich vegetable and fruit juices to\nreplace water and electrolyte loss in perspiration. Water, by itself, does not replace\nelectrolytes. Potassium-rich vegetable broths are helpful.\nPREVENTION—Plan ahead, so you will not come down with heat stroke later:\n- Drink water. Drink diluted electrolyte drinks. Avoid salt tablets. They do the opposite of\nwhat they are supposed to do. The increased salt in the stomach keeps fluids there longer.\n- Do not use caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco. The first two accelerate dehydration, and the\nsmoking constricts blood vessels.\n- Over several days' time, adapt yourself slowly to the sun. Do not overexert when out in\nit. Avoid working in the mid-day. Wear a hat, and keep on a light-colored shirt.\n- Pour water over your head and shirt, especially if the air is not humid. Keep drinking lots\nof water.\n—See \"Heat Stroke,\" which is different.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We must ever set the Lord before us and trust implicitly in Him. He will guide\nand care for us to the end. As we obey His Inspired Writings, we shall have the help we need.\nHEAT STROKE—1 (Sunstroke)\nSYMPTOMS—The body temperature goes very high (105o F. or more!), sweating is reduced, there is a\nstrong headache, accompanied by tingling, numbness, confusion of mind and delirium.

When there is too\nmuch jostling back and forth, movement which you do not have control over (as when riding in cars,\nplanes, or boats), your sensory system may become overloaded. Since the eyes also sense vertical\nbalance, when what you see does not seem to agree with what your labyrinthine receptors in the inner\near sense, then mental confusion results. Nausea occurs when the brain does not know what to tell the\nbody to do. This weakens the stomach.\nThe experts say that nausea at such a time also indicates that your liver is not doing well.",

      "overview": "- Although excess mucus is normal with some diseases, yet avoiding certain foods will\nlessen the amount of mucus produced. Some foods are high mucus-forming. Overcooking\nof food is part of the problem. Pasteurized milk, white flour, sugar foods, and meat should\nbe avoided if you want to cut down on mucus. Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. If you\nhave cooked food at a meal, begin with raw food. This will help the digestive system\nhandle the increased load that cooked food places upon it.\n- Indigestible food also forms higher levels of mucus in the body. Any specific allergen (a\nfood or substance toward which you are allergic) may cause catarrh. Orientals are\nparticularly sensitive to milk products (up to 85% of them lack the digestive enzyme\nneeded to handle milk sugar, which is lactase).\n- Other irritants include fumes, smoke, foreign objects, chemicals, drugs, spicy foods, salt,\npepper, alcohol, and poor food combinations.\n- Use steam to break up the catarrh (mucus) so you can sleep well. Eucalyptus oil also\nhelps. Be sure and drink enough water. As intake decreases, the mucus thickens and cuts\noff breathing.\n- During the illness, you may drink primarily of fluids (fruit juices) at times. But at those\ntimes when you eat, emphasize a high fiber diet using raw food. When grains are eaten,\nthey should be whole grains, such as brown rice, millet, and buckwheat. You may wish to\ntake a psyllium seed and herbal mixture to clean out the digestive tract of mucus. Herbs\nfor this purpose could include burdock, aloe vera, ginger, alfalfa, cascara sagrada, kelp,\nand slippery elm.\nNUTRIENTS—Vitamins A, B, complex, C, and bioflavonoids are important. Also needed are calcium,\nmagnesium, and potassium.\nHelpful herbs include chickweed, mullein, plantain, sorrel, white oak bark, bayberry bark, comfrey,\neucalyptus leaves, white pine needles, and oregano.\nENCOURAGEMENT—It is vital that we exercise faith moment by moment, and hour by hour.

      "overview": "NOTE—Most of the following recommendations would also apply to coughs and flu.\nSYMPTOMS—Colds are a general inflammation of the mucus membranes of the respiratory passages.\nSymptoms include nose and throat irritations, watery eyes, fever, headaches, chills, muscle aches, and\ntemporary loss of smell and taste.\nA heavy cold may take the form of acute or chronic infection, such as flu, grippe, tonsillitis, sinusitis,\nbronchial catarrh, chronic cold, or similar virus-type infection.\nChildren who frequently have colds or flus may have thyroid malfunctions.\nCOLDS AND FLU—How can you tell whether it is a heavy cold—or the flu? Here is the difference:\nHeadache - prominent in flu, but rare in a cold.\nFever - frequent and sudden in flu; rare in a cold.\nFatigue - extreme in flu and can last 2-3 weeks; there is only mild fatigue with a cold.\nGeneral aches - common and often severe in flu; slight in a cold.\nRunny nose - occasionally in flu; common with a cold.\nCough - common with flu and can become severe; only mild to moderate in a cold.\nSore throat - sometimes with flu; common with a cold.\n—For more on flu, see \"Influenza.\"\nCAUSES—In one sense, the cause is a variety of viruses. But in another, the person has allowed himself\nto become run-down so that the virus was able to take hold. Factors which lower the body's resistance to\nvirus infection are overexposure to cold, fatigue, recent or present infections, allergic reactions, and\ninhalation of irritating dust or gas, overeating, wrong eating, and sugar or alcohol consumption.\nThe common cold is not an infection that leaps out and attacks an innocent passerby. It is not even a\ndisease. A cold is the cure of a pre-diseased condition. and the symptoms are attempts by the body to\nreestablish normal conditions. The body is carrying out a \"spring cleaning.\"\nThe cold virus can change size and shape, making it impossible to produce a suitable vaccine. There are\nmore than 100 different viruses which cause colds. Symptoms last for 7-14 days regardless of therapy.\nThe incubation period is very short (1-3 days), instead of the 10-21 days for most viruses. The cold\nseems to suddenly appear. When you get a tingling nose and throat, nasal mucus, or scratchy throat; do\nnot wait for the coughing, weakness, and fever to begin! Go to bed.",

Once it arrives, it cleanses toxins from\nthe system and, along with the rest, enables the person to get back into better shape. A\ncold is actually a blessing, for it forces people to rest who, otherwise, would prematurely\ndevelop debilitating, chronic, and life-threatening diseases.\n- A cold is always in the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, and upper\nbronchials). If congestion develops in the chest, the cold is worsening into something even\nmore serious!\n- Do not ignore a cold and drag on with your work. As soon it develops—go to bed, drink\nfresh lemon juice in water, and settle down to getting well!\n- If you do not know how to take care of yourself, you had better contact a physician,\nespecially if:\n(1) Chills and shortness of breath occur.\n(2) An accompanying fever goes above 101o F. for more than three days, or\nany fever above 103oF.\n(3) Yellow or white spots appear in the throat.\n(4) The lymph nodes under the jaw and in the neck become enlarged.\n(5) Any hot, extreme pain, such as earache, swollen tonsils, sinus pain, or\naching lungs or chest occurs.\n(6) There is excessively large amounts of sputum or sputum that is greenish\nor bloody.\n(7) There is extreme difficulty swallowing.\n(8) Wheezing occurs.\n(9) There is shortness of breath.\n- If you have a sore throat, beware of white or yellow patches on the throat. These can be\nGroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci, which can damage the heart muscle. Have a throat\nswab done when there might be a question about this.\n- Children with high fevers should see a physician within 24 hours.\n- Treatment should include as much vitamin C as you can take, without producing\ndiarrhea (up to 5,000 mg at a time). In acute cases, 1,000 mg of C every other hour. Also\ntake bioflavonoids (200-600 mg), small amounts garlic. (along with vitamin C, it is an\nexcellent germ fighter), vitamin A (50,000 units for not more than one month; then down\nto 25,000 units), calcium lactate or gluconate (6 tablets), brewer's yeast, B6 (100 mg; it is\na natural antihistamine, as well as providing helpful protein), vitamin E (600 units),\nbetaine hydrochloride, zinc gluconate lozenges, and vitamin F (unsaturated fatty acids)\nreduces the frequency and duration of colds.\n- In acute stages when fever is present, the person should abstain from all solid foods and\nonly drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices, diluted (50-50) with water, plus herb teas. The\nproper treatment of colds is to encourage elimination through all channels, so that\nelimination through one channel does not become excessive.\n- As soon as the crisis subsides, let the person have some protein and other food.\n- Drink potato peeling broth twice a day. The peelings should be one-half inch thick\n(throw away the centers). Boil it for about 20-30 minutes; strain, cool, and drink. Make it\nfresh every day.\n- Avoid chills, get adequate bed rest, and take a little salt to replace that lost in sweat.\n- After the fever subsides, a low calorie raw fruit and vegetable diet can be eaten. This\nshould include plenty of raw juices and herb teas, sweetened with a little honey. Some raw\nseeds and nuts can be eaten, but should be chewed well.\n- Herb teas can include rose hips, golden seal, chamomile, peppermint, slippery elm,\nginger, desert tea. Eucalyptus oil is helpful. Put 5 drops in a hot bath or 6 drops in a cup of\nboiling water. Put a towel over your head and, without burning yourself, inhale it. Licorice\nroot tea, drunk daily, soothes an irritated throat and relieves coughing. You might wish to\ntake hop tea to help you get to sleep at night.\n- Avoid aspirin (especially for children), since it causes internal bleeding. There is also\nanother problem: What you think is of little consequence may be flu or\nchickenpox—which are caused by a virus. Colds are also. When children who have\ncertain viral infections take aspirin, their risk of developing Reye's syndrome is greatly\nincreased! This is a rare but fatal brain and liver disease. The same warning applies to cold\nmedications containing aspirin.\n- As already mentioned, take vitamin C, zinc, and garlic. Avoid being depressed; try to be\ncheerful. There is healing in this. Keep looking to Jesus and praying to God. Let a friend\nread a Bible promise to you every so often; think about it. Rest and relax and do not\nworry. Keep warm, but get fresh air from time to time. Take a lot of liquids. Gargle three\ntimes a day with saltwater (1 glass of warm water with 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in). Take\na hot shower.\nThere are a variety of water treatments which can be applied:\n- Take a hot mustard foot bath to increase eliminations and reduce head and sinus\ncongestion.\n- Take a hot Epsom salt bath while drinking sweating teas. Pour Epsom salts (1-2 lbs.)\ninto a hot tub. While soaking, drink 2-3 cups of hot pleurisy root tea. Immediately after\nthe bath, get into bed and cover with plenty of blankets, so profuse sweating can begin.\n- Take a hot ginger chest compress.\n- Use salt water nasal douche to open the sinuses.\n- Apply a trunk pack. Apply a full cold trunk pack each evening. The objective is to\nstimulate skin elimination and induce perspiration. Leave it on for at least 3 hours at night.\n- Take a steam inhalation, using eucalyptus, pine needles, cloves, and/or thyme.\n- Apply a cold compress to the neck, and leave it on for 1-3 hours or all night. It must\n(must) dry out before morning, or the value has been lost. If it does not change into a\nheating compress, it can increase the sore throat condition.\nPREVENTION—Once contracted, a cold must run its course. So it is better, far better, to prevent it\nthan cure it. The best prevention is to live right, eat right, get enough out-of-door exercise to strengthen\nthe body, and get enough rest. Do not skimp on sleep at night, especially in the colder months. Do not\nshare food with someone who has a cold. Be sure and dress warmly enough when it is cold. Do not sit in\na draft. Do not go outside with a wet head.\nMany people, who are especially susceptible to colds, never get them. They have learned to live above\nthe level where they contract such infections. Learn the distant early warning signs.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ died so you could be forgiven of your sins, and, by His grace, be\nenabled to obey His revealed will, as written in the Ten Commandments. Some people obey this one,\nand some obey that one. But God wants us to obey all ten precepts, as given in Exodus 20.",

A sinus infection generally drips mucus down the throat,\nproducing a cough.\nCroupy coughs produce a loud raspy sound, bringing up phlegm with difficulty. A few drops of lobelia\nherb under the tongue every few minutes will relax the cough muscles and may loosen the mucus. Be\nsure and drink enough water and other liquids, so the mucus does not become thick.\nDamage to the lung tissues, caused by pneumonia, can result in a chronic cough.\nWhile on the subject of coughs, there are two other kinds of cough:\nLung cancer or tumors can produce a mild cough, which gradually becomes worse, possibly\naccompanied by blood.\nThen there is smoker's cough. Lung cancer may follow, unless the tobacco is thrown away.\nIf there is any suspicion of tuberculosis, read that article.",

      "overview": "- Apply eucalyptus oil inhalations, 10 min. a day, will help.\n- An excellent cough syrup is made by mixing equal parts lemon juice and honey, with a\nlittle cayenne pepper tea. Take 1 tsp. when needed.\n- Boil a quart of water; lower the fire as much as possible and add a half tsp. cayenne\npepper. Wait a few minutes, then wet a towel in the water, wring it out and wrap it around\nthe neck. Keep the water hot and change this fomentation every 3-4 min, doing this for a\nhalf hour while feet are soaked in hot water.\n- Helpful herbs include licorice, fig leaves, mullein, vervain, oregano, bay leaves, hyssop,\nand thyme. Take 3 cups a day (1 tsp. granulated herbs per cup boiling water. Never boil\nthe herbs. Never use aluminum ware).\n- Mix thick flaxseed tea with 1-2 drops eucalyptus oil, and drink slowly.\n- Add a tsp. salt to a pint of soft, warm water; snuff it up the nose, then blow it out gently.\nRepeat till the nose is entirely clean of mucus. Then gargle the throat and rinse the mouth\nout thoroughly with similar salt water.\n- Whenever there is a cold, keep the nose and mouth clean. This will tend to keep the cold\nfrom going down into the lungs.\n- Cleanse the colon with high enemas. Continue until they reach the upper part, where the\ntransverse colon is.\n- If there is any nausea or bad feeling in the stomach, take an emetic to vomit it out.\nLukewarm water, or water with a little salt in it will generally help do this. Drink all the\nwater possible, and then run the finger down the throat. Repeat till the stomach is clean.\nThen drink a few cups of a hot herb tea (such as sage, hyssop, yarrow, black cohosh,\npeppermint, or chamomile). Later in the day, drink some more.\n- Keep quiet and stay in bed. Take only fruit juices (or lemon juice in hot water). Later\ndrink the broth of thick white potato peeling soup (also called potassium broth).\nHYDRO—The following suggestions are from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order\nsheet) (pp. 181, 208, 217, 246):\nHeating Chest pack, to be changed every 6 hours. If temperature is elevated, change chest pack every 24 hours. Copious water drinking, 2-3 pints daily.\nFomentation to spine; sipping hot water; Chest Pack. Cold Compress to the throat; gargling hot water\nseveral times daily; Steam Inhalation 15 min. every hour, sipping half a glass of hot water when inclined\nto cough.\nFor irritable cough, without expectoration: Sipping very hot water; gargle hot water; Steam Inhalations;\navoid mouth breathing; keep air of room warm (75-80o F.), and moist with steam; carefully avoid\nexposure of back of neck, chest, or shoulders to drafts, or to chill by evaporation during treatment.\nFor cough with viscid expectoration: Copious hot water drinking; fluid diet; Fomentation to chest every\n2 hours, followed by Heating Compress.\nFor painful cough: Fomentation to chest every 2 hours; tight bandage about chest to restrain movement\nif necessary; Revulsive Compress for 15 min. every 2 hours or often as needed. Dry cotton Chest Pack\nbetween applications.\nFor ineffective cough: Increase expulsive power by rubbing, or percussion of the chest with the hand\ndipped in ice water, or slapping the chest with a cold, wet towel.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ knows every temptation that comes to man, and the capabilities of each\nhuman agent. He can help you overcome and obey His Ten Commandment law. He died to take away\nyour sins, and give you strength to live right.",

      "overview": "———————————————————\nHYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments discussed in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see\norder sheet):\nTo warm up the body: The Heating Wet Sheet Pack, which begins when the warming pack has raised the\nbody temperature slightly above its usual degree; and ends when general perspiration begins. Once\nachieved, for best results this should be continued for about 20 min. (pp. 63-64).\nTo increase heat production: The Tonic Frictions, which include the Wet-hand Rub, the Cold Mitten\nFriction, and certain others (pp. 98-106).\nThe following listing of heat producing water treatments is arranged from most to the least powerful,\nand is primarily composed of tonic and fever-reducing applications: Graduated bath. Cooling Wet Sheet\nPack. Cold Friction Bath. Prolonged Tepid Full Bath at 88o F. Cold Full Bath, followed by a short Hot\nFull Bath, Pail Pour, or Shower. Tepid Pail Pour. Cold Pail Pour. Cold Compress. Graduated Compress.\nEvaporating Sheet. Cold to head and neck. Cold to spine. Cold to abdomen. Cold over heart. Cold\ncolonic. Tepid or cold enema. Cold water drinking, a measure that should be combined with all the\nothers named above. Cold air bath (p. 39).\nIt is the impression of cold on the thermic nerves of the skin that best increases heat production. The\nmore intense (and sometimes prolonged) this impression, the greater the desired effect. The most intense\neffects are produced by prolonging the application until the temperature of the body has been slightly\nlowered. But if the cold is greatly prolonged, or is repeated at short intervals, the heat-rise effect fails (p.\n42).\nENCOURAGEMENT—Amid the perplexities that press upon the soul, there is only One who can help\nus out of all our difficulties, and bring us peace of heart.\nSection 1\nGeneral Problems\nPart 4\nInfections",

Yet, in contrast, the body uses the same variety of\npowerful defenses to resist and overcome both bacterial and viral crises! So help your\nbody win the battle. The Lord has placed strong defenses against sickness within each of\nus. We can claim them more fully if we are living according to the laws of health.\n- Vitamins C, A, and B6 are especially helpful. Also see the rather complete list of helpful\nsuggestions under Common Cold.\n- Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant and free radical eliminator. Vitamin B complex and\nselenium (500-1,000 mcg/day) are other effective agents.\n- Vitamin C (2,000-10,000 mg daily, in divided doses) works in the white blood cells to\nproduce a powerful antiviral task force.\n- Zinc (50-100 mg daily) is also important in adding the body's own immune functions.\n- Helpful herbs include echinacea and goldenseal, Garlic is another powerful helper.\nPREVENTION—When the invaders are strong and many, and the body is in a weakened condition,\nthen trouble begins. Keep yourself in good health. Get enough rest, exercise in the open air, and\nmaintain a balanced, nourishing diet.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God can help you, if you will daily seek Him for that help.

Calcium, kelp, and alfalfa are also important.\nPrimarily eat raw foods, and avoid all junk food.\n- Charcoal poultices or clay packs are helpful.\n- Drink a tea of hyssop, chickweed, vervain, mint, and sage. Read again the section on the\nCommon cold.\nPlace a compress of fenugreek or chamomile on the area.\n—Also see \"Common Cold.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is ever seeking to draw souls to Himself, but Satan is seeking to draw\nthem away. We must resist the temptation to separate from our Lord and Saviour. He is the only One\nwho can help us amid all our trials and needs.\nINFLUENZA—1 (Flu, La Grippe)\nSYMPTOMS—Prostration, fever, chills, high fever, sore throat, headache, aching behind the eyes with\nlight sensitivity, abdominal pain, hoarseness, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, aching of the back and\nlimbs, and frequent vomiting and diarrhea. The person feels cold and shaky, but is sweating. Serious\ncomplications, such as pneumonia, sinus infections, and ear infections, can develop.\nThe earliest signs are similar to those for the common cold: weakness, headache, and aching in the arms,\nlegs, and back. He may feel feverish, and then chilly. The flu also generally brings on a dry throat and\ncough, and extreme weariness.\nCAUSE—Also known as \"the flu,\" influenza is a highly-contagious viral infection of the respiratory\ntract. It is easily spread by sneezing and coughing. Individual strains continually change, so vaccines are\nnot very successful.\nThere are three main types of influenza: A, B, and C. Type A is the most common; all are air-born and\nmost frequently spread by droplets (coughing, sneezing, kissing, and using drinking glasses and towels).\nFlu epidemics occur every 1-3 years, generally in the autumn or winter. A major epidemic occurs about\nevery 10 years, because the virus type has changed.\nBecause it is a viral infection, influenza may appear suddenly after an incubation of only 1 to 3 days\n(most frequently 48 hours after exposure). So begin treating it as soon as you can. The quicker you start\ntreating a physical problem, the easier and more quickly it can be solved. After 2-3 days the fever\nusually subsides and, if cared for properly, the other acute symptoms rapidly diminish. But the cough,\nweakness, and fatigue may persist for several days or weeks.",

      "overview": "- Give fluids (fruit juices, vegetable soups) to replace fluid and electrolytes lost through\nsweating, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Drink at least 10 glasses of water a day to keep\nlung secretions thin. Give vitamin C to bowel tolerance (3,000 mg or more, spaced\nthrough the day). Also vitamin A and zinc (50 mg thrice daily), and B complex. Vitamin\nA protects the lining of the throat.\n- Eat lightly and carefully. When it is time to make the transition from liquids to food,\nemphasize bland, starchy foods. This would include dry toast (so it will be chewed better),\nbananas, applesauce, boiled rice, cooked cereal, and baked potatoes.\n- Antibiotics have no effect on the flu virus, and should not be used. Do not smoke, drink\nliquor, use coffee, or eat junk food.\n- Because influenza can lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia, it is also well to include\nechinacea and goldenseal.\n- Take an enema at the first symptom. For fever, take catnip tea enemas, plus a 1/4 to 1/2\nteaspoon of lobelia tincture every 3-4 hours until the fever drops. This is also for children.\n- The eucalyptus oil vapors are also good. (See \"Common Cold.\")\n- Another worthwhile formula is slippery elm bark powder (1 tablespoon), mixed with\nboiling water (1 quart) and honey (half a cup). Put in a jar and give one teaspoon every 34 hours for cough and sore throat.\n- Gargle with salt water to help relieve the sore throat (1 teaspoon salt in 1 pint warm\nwater). Soak the feet in hot water to ease a headache or nasal congestion. Occasionally\nbreath deeply in and out to refresh and strengthen the lungs, and remove wastes.\n- Humidify the air in the room. Make sure the air is warm, but also has a current of air to\nkeep it oxygenated. But it should not be drafty. (A draft on the patient is defined as\noccurring when the skin becomes cooler than the forehead, or the patient is not\ncomfortable.) Keep warm. Wear warm, close-fitted bed clothes. Back rubs may be given\nto increase comfort.\n- Helpful herbs include cinchona bark, ginger, eucalyptus, slippery elm, sea buckthorn,\nyarrow, white willow, and wormwood.\nPREVENTION—Be careful, for influenza is sometimes fatal, especially for children and the elderly.\nThose who are not hardy and poorly nourished are especially susceptible. If you have a respiratory\nailment (asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, etc.), solve it as soon as possible. One thing can lead to\nanother till you are prostrated with sickness. The flu can often lead to ear infections, pneumonia, and\nsinus infection.\nChildren who frequently come down with the flu should be checked for hypothyroidism. Check his\ntemperature under the arm with a thermometer.\nA case of flu is becoming serious if the voice becomes hoarse, he develops pains in his chest, he has\ndifficulty breathing, or he starts bringing up yellow- or green-colored phlegm. It may be best to see a\nphysician, if this has not already been done.\n—See \"Common Cold\" for how to differentiate between a heavy cold and the flu. Also see\n\"Influenza—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—We must have faith that will not be denied, faith that will take hold of the\nunseen, faith that is steadfast, immovable. Christ can help you, right where you are. Not only can He\nsolve your physical problems; He can guide you all the way to the Holy City above.\nINFLUENZA—2 (La Grippe) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—A fever is an elevation of body temperature above normal. A fever is not a disease, but\na symptom that an infection or disease is present. Fevers are common in a wide variety of diseases, from\nmild to severe.\nSymptoms include headache, flushed face, body aches, nausea, little or no appetite, and sometimes\ndiarrhea or vomiting. Skin may be warm with some perspiration, or hot and dry. The elevated\ntemperature is an effort by the body to burn out infection, and the perspiration helps eliminate toxins.\nTherefore a partial fever may be helpful to the body in fighting the infection. If the fever does not get too\nhigh, let it run its course. Many enzymes, antibodies and white blood cell responses are better during\nslightly elevated temperatures.\nMORE ABOUT FEVERS—Normal is generally considered to be within a range of 97o to 99o F., but it\ncan vary among individuals. If it is 100o F. or above, it is a fever. One should not have undue concern\nunless the body temperature rises above 102o F. in adults or 103o F. in children. Then call a doctor\nimmediately.\nWhen body temperature is not more than 5o above normal, it does not completely interfere with body\nfunctions. But levels above 105o F. are dangerous; at 106o F., convulsions are common; at 108o F.,\nirreversible brain damage frequently results.",

Others include meadow-sweet, sea buckthorn, European holly, and\nmugwort. A poultice can be made from echinacea root to lower fever. Linden tea can\ninduce sweating to break a fever. Black elder tea is also good.\n- Keep in mind that the fever is not the infection; the infection must be solved, as well as\nthe fever.\n- Vitamin C and lemon juice are especially helpful. Other nutrients include vitamin A, B\ncomplex, B1, D, calcium, potassium, and sodium.\n- There is a loss of protein during a fever. Caloric needs are higher, and metabolism is\nincreased. Greater fluid intake is required. As fluid is lost, sodium and potassium are lost.\nDrink plenty of distilled water; also fruit and vegetable juices. It is important that solid\nfood be avoided until the fever reduces.\n- Nutrient-rich juices are especially helpful: beet juice, carrot juice, etc.\n- For a feverish child, embed a grape or strawberry in a cube of frozen fruit juice, and let\nhim suck on it.\n- Never give aspirin to children. It can trigger Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal\nneurological illness.\n- He needs lots of oxygen. Make sure there is a current of air in the room; open the\nwindow. Get smokers out of the house.\n- Wet compresses help reduce temperature. Remove them and apply new ones as he heats\nthe old ones. Apply them to the forehead, wrists, and calves. Keep the rest of the body\ncovered.\n- Cool tap water can be sponged on the skin to dissipate excess heat. Wring out a sponge\nand wipe one section at a time, keeping the rest of the body covered. Because of rapid\nevaporation, you will not need to dry him with a towel.\n- Some people shiver when they have a fever. In such cases, immerse them in a tub of\nwarm water. This will also lower temperature. For babies, give room-temperature baths.\nSandwich them between wet towels, which are changed every 15 minutes.\n- If very hot, remove more covers and clothes; if chilly, add them.\n- When signs of fever are gone, be sure to prevent chilling.\n- Putting too many clothes on a child can actually cause a fever.\nREOCCURRENCE—If feverish flu-like symptoms keep reoccurring; in children this might indicate\ndiabetes, and in teenagers and adults Epstein Barr virus.\n—Also see \"Fever Diseases.\" Also see diseases listed under \"Childhood Problems (\"Chickenpox,\"\n\"Diphtheria,\" Measles,\" \"Mumps,\" \"Scarlet Fever,\" etc.).\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ came so that whosoever believeth in Him may be saved.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—It is the immune system which fights infections, and it does this by triggering defenses\nagainst invading bacteria. The antibodies and antitoxins of this system recognize these foreign bodies\nand send white blood cells to attack them. With his immune system weakened, a person is less able to\nwithstand Epstein Barr virus, candidiasis, food allergies, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, etc.\nInfections occur more easily. The person is more susceptible to colds, infections, and viruses.\nCAUSES—Autoimmune disorders can result from conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to\nkidney disease. Unrelenting stress, chronic allergies, chronic infections can exhaust the immune system.\nMedicinal drugs, such as cortisone, prednisone and chemotherapy cause immune depression! Beware of\nthem! Other causes of a weakened immune system are vaccinations and immunizations against common\nchildhood and epidemic diseases. The thymus gland seems to be the most affected by this weakening.\nThe thymus gland is especially important due to its production of T-helper cells.\nProlonged stress, or toxic exposure to chemicals or radiation can weaken the immune system. Severe\ninfections can both result and cause it. An example of this would be allergies (resulting from immune\nmalfunction) which follow a severe case of rheumatic fever, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or other acute\nviral or bacterial disease. Lack of proper rest is yet another cause.\nYet another cause are nutritional deficiencies. Some natural healing specialists believe that any\ninfectious disease may be considered an immune deficiency problem.\nThe taking of aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, asthma, low birth weight and birth defects.\nMeat contains hormones, antibiotics, and bacteria which brings on disease. Alcohol, nicotine, and a highsugar diet weaken the immune system. Air pollution is yet another problem (move out of the city!)\nHypothyroidism can also result in immune deficiency. Marijuana, cocaine, and the morphine family are\nother culprits. Mercury amalgam fillings are yet another incipient cause.",

    "title": "Lupus",
    "fields": {
      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—It usually begins suddenly with fever, fatigue, arthritis and/or joint pain. Those with it\nare frequently misdiagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis. Ninety percent of lupus occurs in women in\ntheir 30s. Other symptoms include a characteristic facial \"butterfly\" rash, severe hair loss, and papular\nskin lesions. This rash forms over the nose and cheeks in something of a butterfly shape (which tends to\nintensify because of sunlight).\nThe skin lesions are small, yellowish lumps. They leave scars when they disappear. (\"Lupus\" means\n\"wolf\" in Latin; indicating the rough-skinned appearance it gives to the skin.)\nAlso generally present are kidney disease (in 50% of those with lupus) and low white blood cell count.\nAll this, in turn, produces inflammation of the joints and/or blood vessels, affecting many parts of the\nbody.\nSometimes the first appearance of the problem is an arthritic-like condition, with swelling and pain in\nthe joints and fingers. Severe cases can affect the brain and heart.\nSometimes the central nervous system is affected, and deep depression, amnesia, seizures, or psychosis\ncan result.\nCAUSES—Lupus is an inflammatory disease of the connective tissue. It has been classified as an\nautoimmune disease, since the body is attacking itself.\nUltraviolet rays in the sun can trigger the first attack. Stress, childbirth, fatigue, infection, chemicals, and\ncertain drugs can also bring it on.\nTREATMENT—Dr. Max Gerson used a careful, very nourishing diet, including vegetable and fruit\njuices and vitamin-mineral supplementation to eliminate lupus in his patients, but the dietary change had\nto be total or no progress was made. All meat, gravy, fats, junk food, fried food, soft drinks, caffeine,\nalcohol, etc. had to be eliminated from the diet. The diet had to be low in fat and salt (thus helping the\nweakened kidneys).\n- It is best to eliminate all unsaturated fats. Fats quickly become rancid and, in that form,\nharm the connective tissue, and wear away the myelin sheath which covers the nerves.\n- Avoid eating alfalfa sprouts, for they contain canavain which, in your body, replaces its\narginine.\n- A vegetable juice fast would be very helpful.\n- Do not take birth control pills; they can intensify the lupus.\n- Up to 10% of the lupus cases originate by taking medicinal drugs (New England Journal\nof Medicine). Pollutants, additives, chemicals, and certain foods can also bring it on.\nWhen the cause is drugs, the kidneys or nervous system are generally not affected, the\nlupus is a milder case, and it tends to stop when the drug is no longer taken.\n- Parasites are associated with lupus. The parasites excrete droppings which interfere with\nbody functions. Until the blood stream is cleansed and the parasites removed, healing\ncannot commence.\n- Allergies can be another causative factor. Search them out and eliminate them. Here are\nseveral to consider: beef, cow's milk, wheat, corn, ammonia, hair spray, formaldehyde,\nperfume ethanol, pesticides.\n- Those with Raynoud's disease should live carefully, for they are also prone to\ncontracting lupus. Those with lupus are often misdiagnosed as having syphilis. Lupus is\nnot AIDS. HIV destroys the body's immune system, but lupus is one's immune system\ndestroying his body.\n- Obtain enough rest and exercise. Avoid all stress.\n- Echinacea, yucca, red clover, pau d'arco, and goldenseal are helpful herbs.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God's faithful ones have ever been able to obtain help from Him. Give Him\nyour heart, and He will fulfill all your needs. In His strength, you can obey all that He commands in the\nBible.",

    "title": "Sjogren'S Syndrome",
    "fields": {
      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—A variety of symptoms keyed to a lack of mucous-secreting glands to not function\nproperly: dry or parched mouth, burning throat, trouble chewing or swallowing, gritty or sandy eyes,\neyes which feel like they have a film over them.\nOther symptoms include tooth decay, joint pain, digestive problems, dry nose, dry skin, lung problems,\nvaginal irritations, muscular weakness, kidney problems, burning tongue, and extreme fatigue.\nCAUSES—Sjogren's syndrome (pronounced SHOW-grens) is a chronic autoimmune disease which was\nfirst identified by a Swedish physician, Henrik Sjogren, in 1933.\nAs an autoimmune disorder, Sjogren's syndrome causes the body's immune system to work against\nitself, destroying mucous-secreting glands, including salivary and tear-producing tissues.\nAlthough not life-threatening, Sjogren's is progressive, debilitating, and can permanently damage the\neyes and mouth if symptoms are not treated.\nWhen Sjogren's occurs alone it is considered \"primary.\" When patients also have an additional\nconnective disease, Sjogren's is called \"secondary.\" These other diseases include rheumatoid arthritis,\nlupus, polymyositis (inflammation of the muscles), scleroderma (thickening and stiffening of the skin) or\npoyarteritis nodosa (inflammation of the arteries).\nAnyone at any age can be afflicted with this disease. In the U.S., estimates run to 200,000 to 4 million;\nof which 90% are women.\nBecause each symptom affects different parts of the body, physicians and dentists often treat the\nsymptom which applies to their field as minor and of little consequence.\nTests are available to diagnose the disease. The cause is, so far, unknown. And, to date, there are no\nknown cures. The treatments, some of which are noted below, only help a person live with the condition,\nrather than solving it. Yet, if it can save your eyesight or an internal organ, it is worth it.\nTREATMENT—You can learn much more about this condition by contacting the National Sjogren's\nSyndrome Association, P.O. Box 42207, Phoenix, AZ 85023 (800-395-NSSA); they will send you free\nliterature.\n- Or contact the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation, 333 North Broadway, Suite 2000,\nJericho, NY 11753 (516-933-6365).\n- They will tell you that artificial tears (eye drops) and salivas, ointments and antinflammatory drugs are among the treatments prescribed.\n- We asked one individual we know, who has Sjogren's and believes in, and regularly\nuses, natural remedies, and were told this:\n- Women with this problem produce too much estrogen, in relation to the amount of\nprogesterone they make. So purchase progesterone cream and rub in on the belly.\n- For the eyes, add 1/4th tsp. of table salt (or its equivalent in seawater) to one cup of\nwater, bring it to a boil, then let it set until it is tepid. Put some of this in the eyes every so\noften. Do not use store-bought salt, because it contains aluminum, which may damage the\neyes. Take emulsified vitamin A, and use torula yeast. Black walnut husk tea may help.\n—Also see \"Dry Tear Ducts.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is our present, all-sufficient Saviour. In Him all fullness dwells. It is our\nprivilege to know that Christ will be with us, guiding us even to the end. Trust and obey Him. He will\ngive you grace to do it.\nSection 1\nGeneral Problems\nPart 7\nAging",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—You are getting old, and you know it.\nWHAT TO DO ABOUT IT—Some people age more rapidly than others. Causes can include heredity,\nor a debilitating disease. But there can be other reasons.\n- Exercise is important. Lack of it causes loss of bone and muscle mass, and inevitable\nphysical degeneration. Walk out of doors every day! Your life depends on it. Breathe\ndeeply. Be positive and cheerful as you walk. Hold your head up and enjoy it.\n- Hearing loss can accompany aging. Too much fat in the diet, and lack of vitamin A can\ncause hearing problems. Some physicians suggest that hearing loss is a sign of later heart\ndisease.\n- Processes of aging are accelerated by poor living, wrong eating and drinking habits, and\ndangerous activities. Some people make themselves prematurely old.\n- Older people do not absorb nutrients as well as younger people. This includes vitamins,\nminerals, and amino acids. Enzymes and co-enzymes are not produced as abundantly as\nthey formerly were. Food supplements are needed even more than in earlier years.\n- Eat good, nourishing food, but do not overeat. You are not working hard physically, as\nyou once did. Experimental rats were given much less in food calories, and lived 50%\nlonger.\n- Systematic undereating is one of the key secrets of longevity. Lose weight and keep\nslim. Extra weight rapidly ages you.\n- Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. A high fiber diet is important. If you are not\nhungry, then do not eat very much.\n- Brittleness and fragility of bones result as calcium is more poorly absorbed. Make sure\nyou are obtaining an adequate supply of calcium, vitamin D, and copper.\n- Drink freshly-made carrot juice every day.\n- If possible, drink only spring or steam-distilled water. Keep your body's water table\nhigh. It will go a long way toward protecting you against later heart and blood vessel\nproblems.\n- There is increased oxidation of cells with the advance of years. Take vitamin E to help\nsafeguard against this. Vitamins A and C are also antioxidants.\n- The B complex are needed for good brain function, proper digestion, sound nerves, and\nphysical stamina.\n- Vitamin C in your diet will lessen the likelihood of strokes and blood vessel ruptures. It\nstrengthens the body, and promotes healing of wounds. It fights infection.\n- Make sure you are obtaining enough minerals. Take a vitamin/mineral supplement so\nyou will get enough potassium, iron, selenium, zinc, and all the rest.\n- Eat a little Nova Scotia dulse or Norway kelp each day to get those needed trace\nminerals.\n- Stop smoking, drinking, and living in excess. Throw out the caffeine and processed\nfoods. Go to bed on time. If you cannot sleep in the middle of the night, pray and thank\nGod for your blessings. Go outside and breathe deeply of the good night air, then go back\nto bed and to sleep.\n- As much as you can, stay away from medicinal drugs, and you will be happier for it.\n- A person who is depressed or negative will age faster. Cheer up, go to God and surrender\nyour life to Him. Obey His Ten Commandment laws and trust your life to Him. Be\npeaceful in Christ. Find in Him your strength and hope.\n- It can be more difficult to deal with stress as you get older. God can help you with that\nalso.\n- Find someone to help, write to, and pray for.\n- Helpful herbs include ginseng, gotu kola, echinacea, cayenne, pau d'arco, hawthorn, and\nsuma.\nENCOURAGEMENT—What a privilege is ours, to be connected with the Majesty of heaven; the One\nwho loved us and gave His life for us. Never forsake Him, and you will be deeply blessed.\nSection 2\nSkin\nPart 1\nWounds, Bruising\nIMPORTANT—Look under the section, Childbirth and Children: Infant Problems and Childhood\nProblems, for many more skin diseases.",

These hydrotherapy treatments will be found in\nmore detail in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), available from this publisher. Page\nnumbers refer to that book.\nSKIN DISEASES—Short, Cold Full Bath (pp. 124-125). But restrictions are listed as to who this can be\nused on.\nBURNS—The Evaporating Compress; the Cold Irrigating Compress (cool, wet cloth over the area, to\nreduce heat or sprinkle water over it, to intensify the cooling effect); if very extensive, the Prolonged or\nContinuous Neutral Bath.\nDRY SKIN—Sweating Wet Sheet Pack, oil rubbed on skin, Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub;\nWet Sheet Rub, Steam Bath, Hot-air Bath, Electric Light Bath, Sun Bath (p. 240).\nERUPTIONS—If dry, not irritable, give prolonged Neutral Bath. If scaly, alkaline bath (soda bath or\noatmeal bath). If moist and irritable, cool evaporating compress moistened with soda solution (1 oz. to 1\ngal.). If skin is thickened, as in chronic eczema, Hot or Alternate (hot and cold) Spray Douche or\nCompress for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day. If extensively damaged skin (as in pemphigus, confluent\nsmallpox, bad burns), the Continuous Neutral Full Bath until the skin is healed (p. 242).\nERYTHEMA—Cool Evaporating Compress or Irrigating Compress (p. 242).\nSWEATING FEET—Revulsive Douche to feet, with extremes in temperature as great as possible;\nAlternate Hot and Cold Foot Bath, Heating Compress to feet during night, with Cold Mitten Friction of\nfeet in the morning on arising (p. 243).\nINACTIVE SKIN—Sweating process, followed by a cold bath (p. 180).\nINCREASE SKIN CIRCULATION AND TONE—Short sweating procedures, followed by short cold\napplications— such as Wet Sheet Rub, Shallow Bath, or Cold Douche. Daily Cold morning Bath, Cold\nTowel Rub, Cold Shower, or Shallow Rubbing Bath.

The result is some pain\nand swelling, and perhaps black and blue marks.\nCAUSE—Contusions occur when the skin is injured, but the skin is not broken. Blood vessels have\nbeen ruptured, and thus have released blood into the surrounding tissue, including the skin.",

If the wound is larger, then you need to stop the bleeding first,\nand then cleanse the wound. Superficial cuts can be cleaned with soap and water or 3%\nhydrogen peroxide.\n- Golden seal root powder helps stop bleeding and promote healing.\n- Wounds may be bathed with several herbal washes or poultices, including aloe vera,\ncomfrey, or plantain.\n- Squeeze together the edges of the wound and place a butterfly bandage, or something\nsimilar, over it. Apply one for every inch of the cut. A small cut can be closed up and\nsealed with a Band-Aid or gauze wrapped enough to seal it, but not tight enough to hinder\ncirculation.\n- To stop bleeding, apply direct pressure. If an artery has been cut, the blood will spurt\nwith each heart beat. Small artery cuts should receive direct pressure by your finger,\npressed down over clean cloth on the wound. Larger ones may require a tourniquet to\ncontrol it until you get help. But do not use a tourniquet unless you have to, for they can\nbe dangerous if left too tight and too long. Placing the wound in ice-cold water will also\ntend to stop the bleeding.\n- If blood soaks through your bandage, add a new one over the old one. If applying\npressure does not solve the problem, elevate the limb above the level of the heart, all the\nwhile applying pressure with your finger.\n- If inflammation or redness occurs later where the cut was, make a strong tea of a\nnonpoisonous, green herb (Goldenseal powder is the best), and soak the injured area in\nthis hot tea for about an hour every day until it is all right. Re-bandage after each soaking.\n- If a finger, etc., is cut all the way off—and there is no help available—quickly place it\nright back in its own blood, and hold it in place with a wrapping till you can get help.\nHealing will often occur. Go to the nearest hospital emergency room.\n- Give vitamin C orally, to bowel tolerance (1-5 grams).\n- Apply tee tree oil to prevent infection, and reapply every 2-3 hours. To accelerate\nhealing, apply locally one or more of the following: vitamin E (it will also reduce\nscarring), fresh aloe vera juice, or a comfrey poultice.\n—Also see \"Bleeding.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Trusting in God, we can have victory in our lives over the sins which so easily\nbeset.

      "overview": "- For sores that will not heal: vitamin E: 200 units a day. Apply a dressing of fresh\ncomfrey leaves and root or a paste made from raw garlic on gauze for 8-10 hours.\n- For a boil (furuncle), or carbuncle, follow the directions below for an abscess.\n- For a surface abscess: Keep the infected area clean with soap and water. Bring it to a\n\"head\" by placing hot compresses on it. This will make it soft in the center. (Hot\ncompresses or ice bags will also help relieve the pain; hot compresses also promote\nhealing.) A poultice with 3% boric acid can be used or a hot Epsom salt compress\n(dissolve Epsom salt in hot water and apply as a compress all night). Echinacea can be\nused, or a clay poultice. Some use a flaxseed poultice to soften and mature the head.\nEither it will open itself or, when \"ripe,\" you can open it with a sterile needle. Then flush\nit clean with a syringe with pure water or one of the above solutions. If bits of puss or\ndead flesh still remain, apply 3% hydrogen peroxide; then flush out with pure water. The\ncavity will gradually fill in and heal.\n- Take vitamin C orally to bowel tolerance, along with A, B complex, and E. Get plenty of\nbed rest, and drink lots of fluids to help flush the system. Clean the bowels with an enema\nonce a week. Stay on a vegetarian diet, avoiding heavy starches, chocolate, excess sweets,\ntoo many saturated or hydrogenated fats. Brief juice fasts of one to three days are very\nhelpful, especially if you are overweight. Take alternate hot and cold showers every\nmorning and evening (or cool baths every evening). Also good: chlorophyll, garlic, and\nkelp.\n- Drink distilled water with fresh lemon juice, plus 3 cups of goldenseal or echinacea tea,\neach day.\n- Go on a liquid fast for 24 to 72 hours and stay in bed as much as possible during that\ntime. This will cleanse the system and prepare it for a nourishing diet.\n- A nutritious diet with adequate vitamins and minerals is needed to correct the problems\nin the body which led to the abscessed condition.\n- A slippery elm bark and lobelia poultice soothes and helps promote healing.\n- Apply honey externally to the area. It is believed that honey destroys bacteria by\ndrawing the moisture out of those sores.\n- On such open skin ulcers, you can also place herbal poultices, such as German\nchamomile, marigold, arnica, euphorbia, cliff rose, snake root, and/or witch hazel. Also\nhelpful is red clover tea and carrot and beet juice. Also useful: Burdock root, cayenne, and\nyellow dock root.\n- Applying chlorophyll water to the area several times a day will keep it cleansed.\n—Also see \"Boils.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ revealed the love of God to mankind. As Jesus was in human nature, so\nGod means His followers to be. In His strength we are to live the life of purity and nobility which the\nSaviour lived.\nCANKER SORES (Aphthous Ulcers)\nSYMPTOMS—Small oval or round white ulcers that can be very painful. They appear on the tongue,\ngums, inner or outer lips, or on the insides of the cheeks.\nAt first it appears as a red, warm spot, which then ulcerates and has a yellowish border. Next, a\nyellowish mixture of fluid, bacteria, and white blood cells is seen. There is often burning or tingling at\nthe place.\nCanker sores are different in appearance than cold sores, in that canker sores do not form blisters.\nCAUSES—The Greek word, aphthae, means \"to set on fire.\" Allergies, stress, vitamin deficiencies,\nendocrine imbalance, and viral infections are considered to be possible causes.\nYou are more likely to have them if your parents had them. They generally do not begin appearing till\nthe age of 20, and occur equally among men and women. Older people have them less frequently.\nCanker sores generally heal by themselves within a week or two. It is said that as much of 40% of the\nadult population experiences them. Some people seem to have one after the other. People with Crohn's\nDisease (an illness of the bowels) are more likely to have them. Vaccines and antibiotics may cause\nthem.",

Do not smoke or chew snuff!\n- Onions help reduce their number; include them in your food preparation. Lysine, vitamin\nB12, and folic acid help also.\n- Do not eat meat for two weeks. Meat increases body acidity. Stop eating it entirely, and\nyou are less likely to have canker sores.\n- Avoid sugar and processed foods. Citrus fruit cause them in some people.\n- Avoid physical damage to the area immediately in, and around, the mouth. Avoid sharp\nfoods, such as peanut brittle. Use a soft toothbrush with no toothpaste.\n- Try not to bite the tongue or cheek. Do not talk or turn your head while chewing.\n- A hair analysis will help you determine your mineral and pH balance. Maintaining a\nproper balance can help you avoid canker sores.\n- In the Midwest, they put a little earwax on the sore to help heal it.\n- If you have repeated attacks of canker sores, something is wrong. With careful checking,\nyou should be able to find it. For example, with some people, it is simply a matter of not\novereating on sweet foods, even naturally sweet fruit.\n- Beware! If you have a mouth sore which does not heal, see a dentist. There are certain\nother diseases which first appear somewhat like canker or cold sores—yet which are much\nmore dangerous.\n—See also \"Cold Sore.\" You may also wish to turn to \"Syphilis,\" which often initially appears around\nthe mouth. However, the appearance of the hard chancre of syphilis is much different than that of canker\nor cold sores.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God is pleased when we keep our faces turned toward the Sun of\nRighteousness. When we are in trouble and pressed down with anxieties, the Lord is near, and He bids\nus cast all our care upon Him, because He cares for us.\nCOLD SORES (Fever Blisters)\nSYMPTOMS—These are thin-walled inflamed pimples which have a tendency to recur in the same\narea, most frequently at the borders of the mouth, but sometimes on the gums or conjunctiva (the lining\nof the inner surface of the eyelid). It tends to occur at, or close to, where the skin and mucous membrane\nmeet. First comes a local tenderness with a small bump. Then this bump changes into a blister, and the\ntenderness may increase. Nearby lymph nodes may become swollen. After about 48 hours, the blisters\ncrust over. Sometimes pus oozes, making eating difficult. Cold sores appear 3-10 days after exposure\nand may last up to 3 weeks, but generally only 7-10 days.\nCAUSE—This is an infectious disease caused by herpes simplex (herpes simplex virus I; Herpes virus\nhominis). But, for practical purposes, there are other causes as well:\nSome people never have cold sores, and others have them frequently. Stress is a significant cause. Eating\ntoo much sugar is another. Excess ultraviolet light or acid foods cause them in some people. For some\nwomen, the onset of menstruation can be a cause. Alcoholic drinking and poor diet also bring them on.\nLocal irritation can be an incipient factor. For some, cold sores tend to occur with a fever, infection, or\ncold, after exposure to the sun and wind, or when the immune system is depressed.\nIf cold sores occur frequently, the problem may be low thyroid function.\nCold sores seem somewhat like canker sores (which see), but they are different in several ways. They\nform blisters, but canker sores do not. They can form anywhere on the body, although especially on the\nmouth area or on the genitals. Whereas we are not certain of the bacterial or viral origins of canker sores,\ncold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus I.",

Eat better, take time to walk\noutside, and get enough sleep at night.\n- Eat plenty of raw vegetables.\n- Apply ice for 15-20 minutes at the first sign of tingling. If possible, repeat it frequently.\nApply vitamin E between applications. Get enough vitamin A (50,000 units) and B\ncomplex. Zinc is also important (zinc gluconate lozenges); dissolve in mouth every 3\nhours for 2 days or take 25-50 mg daily. Daily take 2,000-3,000 mg of the amino acid\nlysine till the cold sore is gone. Protect your lips from sunburn and wind. Exercise plus\nadequate rest bolsters the immune system, so it can better resist cold sores.\n- Also helpful is goldenseal, echinacea, red clover, and pau d'arco.\n- If it is not bothering you very much, leaving a cold sore alone is a good idea.\n—Also see \"Canker Sores.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—We can only see a little way before us, but God sees everything.

Fever and swelling of the lymph glands\nnearest the boil may occur. Boils are tender, red, painful, and appear suddenly.\nCAUSES—Boils are small pus-filled bumps. The medical name for them is furuncles.\nCarbuncles are many-headed boils which tend to combine and enlarge. They begin as a painful,\nlocalized infection, producing pus-filled areas in the deeper layers of the skin. Carbuncles are slower\nhealing than boils. They are both treated alike.\nBoils are contagious. Do not let the draining pus get on the skin elsewhere! When it spreads to nearby\nareas, the result is a carbuncle.\nUntreated boils tend to exude their poisons and disappear within 10-24 days. But, given careful\ntreatment, they are contained and less severe.\nKeep in mind that if the body is trying to expel a poison (especially sulphur!) through the skin, you may\ncontinue to have a string of boils for a time. The body is trying to cleanse itself of something bad.\nInorganic sulphur in the body is especially prone to come out in skin boils.",

Whenever it is taken\ninto the body, it tries to leave—not through the bowels or kidneys—but through the skin.\n- While on this liquid fast for a couple days, you may drink 3 cups of an herb tea daily of\none or more of the following: comfrey, red clover blossoms, yellow dock root, chickweed,\nplantain, and wild cherry bark.\n- Every night apply a poultice of raw potato mixed with flaxseed. If you apply a poultice\nduring the day, use whole wheat flour and stiffened it with enough honey so it will not\nrun.\n- Apply moist heat (a clean towel, cloth, or gauze that is wet in warm water) 3-4 times\ndaily to the boil. This will reduce pain and help bring it to a head more quickly. Avoid\nirritating the area or spreading the pus. Avoid exercise which might cause sweating until it\nheals.\n- Keep the skin clean by washing it several times a day. Place honey directly over the boil.\nAlternates would be clay, charcoal, and/or chlorophyll.\n- Apply vitamin E oil to the area.\n- Some boils are large and persistent. Some type of poison in the body is trying to get out.\nBed rest, a short fast, followed by a light, nutritious diet will greatly help.\n- Helpful herbal teas include oat straw, goldenseal, dandelion, and burdock root.\n—Also see \"Abscesses.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—If we were left to ourselves, we would make mistakes. But we can go to God,\nour kind Father in heaven, and receive all the help in time of need.\nBED SORES (Pressure Sores)\nSYMPTOMS—These are deep skin ulcers—especially found on buttocks, hips, sacrum, shoulder\nblades, elbows, and heels.\nCAUSES—These ulcers form during periods of prolonged bed rest, as pressure is continually applied to\nbony parts of the body. The bedridden elderly, the unconscious, and the paraplegic are those most likely\nto experience this problem.\nSuch individuals generally have a high pH (too alkaline), and are deficient in vitamins A, B2\n(riboflavin), E, and C, as well as zinc.",

Drink enough liquids, even when\nnot thirsty. Avoid processed, fried, and junk food. Do not eat meat.\n- The diet should include enough fiber. Oat bran is especially good. The bowels should\nmove every day. Lower the pH with acid foods (such as cranberries).\nPREVENTION—Prevention is much easier than treatment.\n- Use protective padding on the bed, massage the skin to stimulate the circulation, and\nkeep the skin dry and clean. Turn the patient regularly. Watch for signs of redness.\nOccasional sunlight to the skin is beneficial. Sponge bathe daily with a mild herbal soap\n(never with harsh soaps). The bed must be kept clean and the sheet without wrinkles.\nSheepskin bed covers help disperse weight more evenly. The use of air or water\nmattresses can be helpful. Sponge baths are helpful. Loose-fitting clothing allows air to\npenetrate to the skin (cotton is best). If the patient can sit up, have him do it 3-4 times a\nday.

For third degree\nburns, immediately go to a doctor or an emergency room. Even more extreme is a fourth degree burn:\nInstead of oozing flesh, the area is dry and charred.\nCAUSES—Tissue damage to the skin as a result of heat, chemical, electrical, or radiation injury. First\ndegree: usually from sun or water; second degree: generally from hot metal objects, flame-contact burns\nand severe sunburn; third: hot fluid burns, steam from a pressure cooker, electrical burns, or high flame\ncontact.",

Apply\nlocally as a tea and wet compress.\n- Second degree: Apply vitamin E oil or zinc oxide. Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance.\nApply aloe vera after healing begins.\n- Third and fourth degree: Immediately take the person to a professional. Do not try to\nremove clothing stuck to the burned area. Apply aloe vera after healing has begun.\n- Soak the clothes, so the hot cloth will not increase the burn. Apply cold until the pain\nsubsides.\n- Cold water or cold, wet cloths on the area reduce pain and swelling. Cover the burn, to\nreduce likelihood of infection. Mix and apply olive oil with baking soda to the area.\nElevate the area, to reduce swelling, and keep it out of the sun. Do not break the blisters,\nand never put salves or butter on burns. Watch for indications of infection, odor, pus, or\nangry redness. Cold clay poultices are useful.\n- Second degree, on up, requires a high protein diet and 5,000 calories per day. Increase\nfluid intake. Also important: vitamins A, B, C, E, and F.\n- Applying vitamin E and spraying on a 1-3% solution of vitamin C every 2-4 hours is\nvery helpful. This reduces pain and accelerates healing. Take 1,000 mg of vitamin C\norally, every hour.\n- Have the patient breathe deeply every so often.

Some of the oil becomes clogged, bacteria multiply, and inflammation results. This occurs during\nadolescence (between 12 and 24), when androgens (male hormones) are released in increased amounts\nin both boys and girls. A few have acne all their lives.\nOther causes include junk foods, oral contraceptives, allergies, stress, and heredity.\nThe problem is intensified when sebum, combined with skin pigments, plugs the pores—and produces\nblackheads. If scales below the surface fill with sebum, whiteheads are formed.\nCanadian Eskimos, prior to 1950, never had acne. When \"modern foods\" were brought in, acne became\ncommon.",

Freckles are caused by melanin pigments which react\nto the sunlight in fair-skinned people. Liver spots are the result of a \"ceroid\" pigment build up in the skin\nof older people.\nThese latter spots are the outward signs of free radical destruction within the body. There is preoxidation of fats—in the cells instead of in the liver. Free radical damage produces waste materials in\ncells throughout the body, including the brain and liver. The causes are poor diet, eating rancid fats, lack\nof exercise, excess exposure to the sun, autointoxication, and sluggish liver function.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Red, dry, cracked hands.\nCAUSES—The low humidity in the fall and winter dries and irritates the skin. The skin of older people\nhas less natural oils. This prepares you for problems. But the other causes, listed below, you can do\nsomething about.\nPREVENTION—If you find you have this problem, there are several things you can do, to prevent or\nlessen it.\n- Water removes oils on the skin. But a special kind of water is especially devastating:\nsoapy water. Dish water not only removes oil from the plates, but also from your hands.\nThat is part of the reason why your hands are chapped and your arms are not! When you\nmust wash your hands, try washing only the palms and not the backs—which, having\nthinner skin, tends to dry out more easily.\n- Soak your hands in warm (not soapy) water for a few moments. As you do this, some of\nthe water is absorbed by the dry skin. Then pat dry and gently rub a little vegetable oil on\nyour hands.\n- What you place on your skin is absorbed into your body, so beware of all the creams and\nlotions on the market. The makers of these products are not required, by the FDA, to\ninclude food grade ingredients; yet those lotions are absorbed into your system for the\nbody to have to deal with.\n- Massage a few drops of glycerine, combined with a few drops of lemon oil (both are\navailable at pharmacies), into your hands at bedtime.\n- Put oil on your hands at night, and then slip cotton gloves over them.\n- Hot-air blowers tend to chap the hands; use a towel instead.\n- Wear white cotton gloves while doing dry work. For harder work, use leather gloves.\nRegarding gloves, avoid vinyl ones, if you can; they makes the hands worse! The rubber\ntraps the moisture and keeps the skin from breathing.\n- Use a long-handled brush, when washing dishes.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Through Jesus, we can have access to God and be accepted by Him.

These would be the uncooked vegetable oils, such as wheat germ oil, flaxseed oil,\nsesame seed oil, corn oil, and soy oil. The oil should be fairly fresh; never use rancid oil,\nfor it destroys the vitamin E in that meal. Take additional vitamin E supplementation (8001,200 units a day).\n- If you are not taking supplemental vitamin A, begin taking a moderate amount (not over\n50,000 units a day). Carrot juice will also help.\n- For the chafing, wear cotton clothes; not synthetics. Australian wool (the wool which\ndoes not scratch) is also good. Wash new inner clothing before you wear it. This softens\nthe fabric. Do not wear coarse cloth next to the skin.\n- Cut out all greases and other saturated fatty acids; and, in their place put a tablespoon of\na good oil (wheat germ oil, flaxseed oil, almond oil, sesame oil, and corn oil) on your food\nafter it is cooked.\n- Drink an adequate amount of water. If necessary, gently rub a small amount of oil over\nyour body after the bath. Avoid commercial lotions and saturated fats (greases). These are\nall absorbed by your body.\n- For your shower, rinse off every day with lukewarm water, and use as little soap as\npossible.

Oatmeal is extremely soothing to\nthe body.\n- Use soap which has cocoa butter, coconut oil, or another vegetable oil.

In men, it may also occur in the scrotum and penis; in women, the\nnipples are most often affected.\nCAUSE—Scabies is an infectious skin disease caused by an almost microscopic mite, called Sarcoptes\nscabiei. Although he is a little fellow, you know he is there.\nScabies is found on all social levels. Contact, even by a handshake, is all that is needed to acquire it. It\ncan also be transmitted through clothing and bed linen. It is more common in older adolescents and\nyoung people, and in girls rather than boys. People can also get it from touching dogs, other animals, or\ntheir bedding. It is a special problem in institutions, such as nursing homes, etc.\nScabies can only be accurately diagnosed by taking skin scrapings and viewing them under a\nmicroscope. If one person in a family has them, it is generally well to treat everyone. Children under 15\nare often the first to contract them.",

These warts, which can be dark or flesh-colored, may range\nin size from a pinhead to a bean, and most frequently occur where the skin is in friction with clothing,\netc. They can also occur on the larynx (voice box) and produce hoarseness. They can be spread by\npicking, trimming, or touching them. On the face, they can be spread by shaving.\n2 - Plantar warts are verruca on the sole of the foot. Both types of verruca are actually benign epithelial\ntumors, caused by a virus.\n3 - Venereal warts (condylomata acuminata) may be found on the vulva and penis. Venereal warts are\ncaused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), of which there are more than 35 types. Genital warts on a\nwoman can change into cancer of the cervix or genital area. They should be removed! One study showed\nthey can increase the risk of cervical cancer by 200 percent! The incubation period for genital warts is\ngenerally 3 months. It can spread to others even before the person realizes he or she has it. Professionals\nrecommend that you not have sexual intercourse until these types of warts are eliminated.\nWith the exception of plantar warts which are flat, warts are always raised bumps. Where there is\nconstant contact, they can cause discomfort and even pain. Venereal (genital) warts are single or clusters\nof soft cauliflower-like growths.",

Eat right, keep proper hours, exercise in the open air, and breath deep. Tone up\nyour whole body.\n- They also appear more frequently in adolescents who are experiencing hormonal\nchanges, especially between 12 and 16.\n- Deficiencies of vitamins A, C, and zinc have all been related to an increased incidence of\nviral infections.\n- The usual methods of removing warts (surgery, acids, burning, electrotherapy, or\nfreezing) often results in their reappearance. The underlying causes should be eliminated:\nImprove the diet; eat foods high in vitamins A, B complex, C, and zinc. Also increase the\nsulfur-containing amino acids in the diet, such as are found in asparagus, citrus fruits,\neggs, garlic, and onions. Be sure and take enough vitamin C every day! Eat raw garlic.\n- Place thin sections of garlic on the wart. Try to avoid touching the garlic to normal\ntissue. Hold it in place with cloth and tape and leave it there overnight. Do this for 2 or 3\nnights. Within a week the wart will fall off.\n- Apply castor oil to the wart, for 3 weeks.\n- Cover with honey, for 15 days.\n- Put 1 drop muriatic acid on the wart once a day, for 8 days.\n- Dissolve as much sodium carbonate (washing soda) in water as will stay in solution.\nSwab this onto the warts for 2 minutes, 4 times a day, and let it dry in the air. Very large\nwarts have responded to this.\n- Apply the juice of milkweed, celandine herb, or the milk from green figs or marigold to\nthe wart.\n- Mix castor oil and baking soda into a paste and apply to wart, cover, and keep on all\nnight. Do not pick at it, but let it slough off within 3-6 weeks.\n- Apply an iron formula, such as Ironite or black walnut tincture.\n- Apply castor oil to the wart for half an hour, 3 times a day.\n- Apply powdered vitamin C, as paste, and cover.\n- Soak the wart in a concentrated salt water solution: 1½ tsp. salt to ½ cup water equals a\n30% solution. Soak the wart for 20 minutes 2-3 times a day for a few weeks.\n- Here are several other helpful applications: green fig juice; that is, juice from barely ripe\nfigs (or milkweed sap) applied several times a day. Fresh grated celandine juice. Cut a raw\npotato, rub it on, and repeat several times a day for several weeks. Chickweed juice.\nSassafras oil. Green papaya juice. Aloe vera. Onion and salt compress. The juice of white\ncabbage. Wheat germ oil. Fresh pineapple juice. Cashew nut.\n- For plantar warts (warts on the bottom of your foot), apply a plantain poultice (the leaf\nitself) to the wart. Another method is to place the inner side of a fresh piece of banana skin\nover the wart and hold it there with tape. Change daily after washing the entire area. Once\na week the thickened outer horny layer is removed. Maximum time for complete\ndisappearance of a wart is 6 weeks, with no recurrence within 2 years.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Do your duty and trust in God, for He knows of what things you have need.\nHe watches over you with more tenderness than does a mother over an afflicted child.\nWENS (Sebaceous cysts; Steatomas)\nSYMPTOMS—These are slow-growing benign cystic cutaneous tumor-like formations.

So count yourself\nfortunate in one way.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God cares for our necessities, and His love and grace are continually flowing,\nto satisfy our needs. In His care, we may safely rest.",

They will make your feet smell like an old rubber tire. The\nproblem may be the shoes, not your feet. Many people today wear such shoes, since they\nare so much less expensive than leather ones.\n- Body odors can also be caused by an excess of toxins in the body which it is trying to\neliminate. Are you eating too much or eating the wrong foods? Are you staying up late at\nnight, drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes? Apply a wet sheet pack overnight. It will\nhelp pull the toxins out of a heavy meat eater. By morning, the sheet will be stained by the\neliminated poisons.

      "overview": "- Dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that generally keeps reoccurring. Its\nprimary symptom is eczema. Dermatitis is actually an allergy which may be caused by\ncontact with perfumes, cosmetics, rubber, medicated creams and ointments, poison ivy, or\ncontact with metal alloys (including nickel, silver, and gold). Some type of food could be\nthe problem. If the irritant continues to be in constant contact with the skin, the dermatitis\nwill spread and get worse. Obviously, if you have this problem you want to solve it!\n- The condition can be intensified by emotional stress and fatigue. Deficiency of any of\nthe B complex vitamins can cause dermatitis. Another important item is unsaturated fatty\nacids. If you are not getting enough, you can begin itching wherever you rub on your skin.\nAdequate vitamin A and enough protein are also essential.\n- Oddly enough, hair loss (alopecia) is commonly associated with dermatitis, especially if\na concurrent unsaturated fatty acid deficiency in the diet exists.\n- If the dermatitis is not terminated, it can so weaken the system, so that more serious\ninfections occur. This is because, at the same time that you are having skin problems, your\nintestines are developing lesions which can greatly weaken your ability to digest and\nabsorb nutrients!\n- It is a fact that 13% of those with severe dermatitis later develop cataracts.\n- Here are some of the allergies which the experts have found to especially cause\ndermatitis:\n1 - Cow's milk. Either stop drinking cow's milk or try switching to goat's\nmilk.\n2 - Wheat gluten (wheat protein). There are other grains you can eat instead.\n3 - Nickel. The experts call this \"nickel rash.\" Women who have their ears\npierced and the nickel post placed in them can produce various rashes on\nthe body—especially where any other metal jewelry touches the skin. By\nthe way, any gold jewelry less than 24-karats has some nickel in it.\n- Beware of the bubble bath and similar soapy tub baths.\n- Children's rashes: A skin rash in children may be caused by eating eggs, peanuts, milk,\nwheat, fish, chicken, pork, or beef. Eggs, peanuts, and milk account for 75 percent of the\nskin rashes in children.\n- Regardless of what may be the cause, omit wheat, rye, oats, and barley for six weeks.\nThen slowly add one back at a time—and see how all this effects the dermatitis.\n- If you know how to do so, you may wish to do a pulse test after each meal, in an attempt\nto ascertain which foods increase heart beat. Those which do are the problematic ones.\n- Avoid dairy products, white flour, fried foods, other processed fats, and sugar. Avoid\nantiperspirants, for they have metal in them. Use cotton undergarments. Fake fingernails\ncause skin rashes. Always use white bathroom tissue only. The dyes irritate the skin. Be\nsure and rinse the soap out of your clothes which have just been washed.\n- Mix goldenseal root powder with vitamin E oil and put some on the affected area. This\nwill reduce the itching.\n- Primrose oil and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) have helped infants with dermatitis.\n- An oatmeal bath is another helpful measure, to reduce the itching during the time\nrequired to solve the underlying cause. Use 2 cups of colloidal (powdered) oatmeal per\ntubful. Colloidal oatmeal can be obtained at a pharmacy.\n- Herbs that may help include comfrey, dandelion, red clover, and pau d'arco.\n- Steep a tbsp. each of burdock root, yarrow, and yellow dock root in a pint of boiling\nwater for half an hour. Strain, add a pound of cocoa fat, and keep boiling and stirring until\nit is a salve. Use this for eczema.\n- Other useful herbs are plantain, chickweed, burdock root, yarrow, and strawberry leaves.\nOne can either drink the tea made from any of them or apply it to the affected area.\n—Also see \"Drug Rash,\" \"Skin Disorders.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ, having redeemed man from the condemnation of the law, could enable\nman to fulfill its requirements. Rejoice that, in Christ, you can stand an overcomer over the temptations\nwhich have oppressed you.\nHIVES (Urticaria)\nSYMPTOMS—Strong itching (pruritus) may suddenly occur. Elevated wheals result, along with\nswollen eyes. The subsequent scratching makes you appear swollen and scratchy. The intense itchy\nwheals which may result may disappear in minutes, hours, or several days. Hives are generally gone\nwithin 1-7 days, except in cases of severe hypersensitivity, when death may result. Occasionally a fatal\nanaphylactic reaction occurs. At such times, edema of the breathing passages produces respiratory\ndifficulty similar to severe asthma.\nCAUSES—The skin is reacting to allergies, physical irritation, stress, or emotions. Special dermal cells\nbegin releasing histamine, which causes internal blood vessels to leak fluid into the deepest layers of the\nskin.\nMeat; dairy; and poultry products, especially in frozen or fast foods, are frequent causes of hives. This is\ndue to the chemicals, antibiotics, and hormones given to farm animals.\nHere is a list of special things known to cause hives in some people:\nAspirin, antimony or bismuth (in various metal alloys), anti-pyrine or phenacetin (pain relievers),\nbarbiturates, BHA and BHT (preservatives), phenobarbital or chloral hydrate (sedatives),\nchlorpromazine and meprobamate (tranquilizers), fluoride (dental products and fluoridated drinking\nwater), food colorings, griseofulvin (antifungal), insulin, liver extract, menthol (in perfumes, candy,\ncigarettes), mercury (dental fillings), morphine, penicillin, pilocarpine (glaucoma medication),\npreservatives, procaine (anesthetic, known as novocaine), quinine, (quinine water and malaria\nmedication), reserpine (heart medication), saccharin (artificial sweetener), salicylates (flavoring and\npreservative), sulfites (preservative in dried fruit), and thiamine hydrochloride (cough medications).",

      "overview": "Immediate help:\n- Anything that is alkaline generally helps the itching. Place a calcium gluconate paste on\nthe skin or apply milk, calamine, or milk of magnesia.\n- Cold compresses or cool baths will immediately help also.\n- An oatmeal or bran bath will help relieve the itching. Place 2 lbs. of ether in a muslin\nbag and set in a hot bath (104o-106o F.).\n- A paste of cream of tartar and water can be applied to the area.\nLonger term solutions:\n- Try to find the cause or causes of this problem. Here are some of the things which result\nin hives in others:\n- Stress, food allergy (milk, wheat, eggs, shellfish, pork, onions, some fruits), chlorine in\ndrinking water, adrenal exhaustion and/or liver congestion resulting from an allergy,\nhydrochloric acid deficiency, food dyes, preservatives, drug allergy, acid conditions,\ninsect stings, chronic infection, penicillin in the milk you drink, aspirin, coffee, alcohol,\nand tobacco.\n- Secondary factors will be spinal lesions, stoppage of lymph flow, imbalance between\ndeep and surface blood circulation, and adrenal exhaustion.\n- Another factor is improperly (too hurriedly) weaning a child from breast milk.\n- Reading over the above lists, it appears that the primary cause is frequently a physical\nreaction to a substance which the body cannot tolerate to have put into it. We live in a\nchemical age. One cannot even drive down the highway without breathing dangerous\nfumes.\n- Do not use steroids, alcohol, or processed foods.\n- Lymph stasis and poor circulation may result from poor skin function, lack of exercise,\nfresh air, and poor elimination; but ingesting poisonous substances top the list.\n- Aside from trying to find the chemical offenders, prolonged fasting is generally\nconsidered the best method of terminating recurrent hives. This cleans out the body and\nenables it to better deal with the chemicals it is daily confronted with. Fasting will help the\nintestines and other organs to heal. It will eliminate toxins and help the bowels begin\nworking properly again. Trunk packs will help induce sweating. Moderate sunbaths will\nhelp also.\n- As a rule, fasting should not be over 1-3 days in length. If you are overweight, longer\nfasts might be considered. If you are thin, never go over 3 days; indeed, one meal or 1 day\nfasts are best for frail individuals. A carrot, beet, and green vegetable juice fast is better\nthan a straight water fast.\n- Use enemas during the fast, and even afterward, until the hives do not return. Maintain\ngood bowel action thereafter.\n- Also important are dietary changes: Be sure and get nutritional supplements, including\nvitamins A, B complex, B6, B12, C, and calcium. You may need to take hydrochloric acid\nwith meals.\n- There is one other cause which we have not yet mentioned: a lack of unsaturated fatty\nacids. The best is wheat germ oil. Flaxseed oil is also outstanding. But corn oil would be\nacceptable. In addition to including only such oils in your diet, you would do well to rub\nwheat germ oil on the affected area.\n- When the problem exists for weeks or months, it is vital that you identify the cause, so\nyou can eliminate the hives.\n- Chronic hives can be linked to candida.\n- When severe anaphylactic reactions occur, immediately take the person to the hospital. It\nis best not to let situations come to such a crisis. Solve the problem before hives produces\nsuch an emergency.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—In the work of redemption, God has revealed His love in sacrifice, a sacrifice\nso broad and deep and high that it is immeasurable. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only\nbegotten Son—that you and I could have eternal life!\nIMPETIGO (Impetigo Contagiosa; Echthyma)\nSYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—Impetigo is not something to ignore. Neglected, it can produce boils,\nulcers, or other skin complications.\nUntreated, it can result in deep infections of the tissue beneath the skin. Impetigo is a skin disease\ncaused by a streptococcal bacteria. It occurs primarily in children, especially in undernourished ones,\nand in the summer months. Lower economic groups living in crowded conditions are the most likely to\ncontract it. It is more frequently found on the face, hands, and arms next and feet and legs third.\nCuts, abrasions, insect bites, and stings allow entry of the bacteria. An area of redness is seen, followed\nby blister-like swellings. The fluid is straw colored. If not scratched, the lesions break down in 4-6 days\nand form a honey-colored crust which heals slowly. The skin beneath may lose its color, not to be\nregained for months. The scratching generally results in more skin injury and a spread of the infection.",

      "overview": "- Impetigo is actually an early sign of immune depression, which allows organisms\nnormally on everyone's skin to produce disease. The body needs to be built up.\n- Proper nutrition is needed, along with sanitary living conditions.\n- In some individuals, a food allergy (such as milk, wheat, or soy) or a contact dermatitis\n(such as detergents in the clothes) weakens the immune system—permitting the impetigo\nto gain a foothold.\n- Strict hygiene is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection to other parts of the\nbody—or to other people.\n- Vitamin A is necessary for good skin health. Give the child a good multivitamin\nsupplement. Give vitamin C, to bowel tolerance.\n- Put a wash of boric acid and herbs such as comfrey, golden seal, or echinacea on the\naffected area.\n- Place garlic oil, squeezed from capsules, on the area.\n- Removal of the crusts results in a more rapid cure. Bathing in soapy water every 4 hours\nduring the day is helpful. Severe cases may require a slightly salty or hydrogen peroxide\napplication (3 parts water to 1 part 3% peroxide). Apply soaks or warm compresses to the\nattached crusts. Hot and cold compresses may be applied after the crusts are gone. At\nnight, charcoal poultices can be attached and left overnight.\n- Use disposable tissues instead of cloth handkerchiefs. Each person should be given his\nown towel and washcloth. Wash the hands frequently; and, while the infection lasts, keep\nthe fingernails short and clean. Change pillowcases and bed sheets daily, and boil all\nlinens for 10 minutes. If possible, isolate the child.\n- Exposure to the air and sunlight will help, but do not swim.\n- If impetigo is on the scalp, cut the hair so you can treat it.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God gave His Son to become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. The gift\nof God to man is beyond all computation. Nothing was withheld. God has done, and is doing, everything\npossible to save us from sin.\nSHINGLES (Herpes Zoster)\nSYMPTOMS—Sharp, burning pain along a nerve route somewhere in your body for 3-4 days. There\nare angry red blisters at that pain site several days later. These are very painful and itchy. Later the\nbumps blister, turn cloudy, and form scabs. It usually lasts 7-14 days from the time the blisters appear\nbefore the scabs drop off. This is no ordinary rash; it is shingles, which is a viral infection of a nerve. It\nmost often occurs on the skin of the abdomen, under the ribs and above the navel. But it can appear\nanywhere on the body. It most frequently occurs after the age of 50.\nIf shingles starts near an eye, beware! The cornea can become infected and blindness may result. You\nwould then do well to consult an eye specialist.\nCAUSES—This staphylococcal infection consists of small round bacteria growing in clusters. The virus\nin the chickenpox you had as a child never really left your body; and, when you are an adult, it comes\nback in the form of shingles. The virus may lie dormant in the spinal cord and nerve ganglia for years\nuntil triggered. It normally lives on the nostrils and skin of everybody.\nWhat triggers the attack? It is known that poisonous substances in food, metals, drugs, and other toxic\nsubstances can do it. For example, risk of shingles increases with the use of anti-cancer drugs. Anything\nthat weakens the immune system can bring on an attack of shingles. Once it occurs, the pain can\ncontinue on for months or years. So it is better to prevent an attack.",

The amino acid,\nlysine, can help inhibit the spread of the herpes virus. The diet must include raw fruits and\nvegetables, brewer's yeast, brown rice, and whole grains. Be sure and eat enough protein.\n- Some suggest leaving the blisters alone if they are not too bothersome. Other suggestions\ninclude placing one or more of the following on them: calamine or other calcium\npreparation on them. Calcium is always soothing to skin rash conditions. Apply vitamin E\noil from a capsule to the area.\n- Put cold water on a cloth and place it over the area. The cooler it is, the better it feels.\nAvoid anything that will make your blistered skin hotter.\n- Put apple cider vinegar on it daily. Take hot baths 2-3 times a week. Take a starch bath\n(one cup of cornstarch or colloidal oatmeal) into a hot tub. Colloidal oatmeal is powdered,\nand is at the pharmacy. Do not slip in the tub!\n- Clean out the bowels frequently. Light fruit and vegetable fasts will also help clean out,\nand strengthen, the body. Wear only cotton clothing while the condition exists.\n- Dab the infection with hydrogen peroxide to purify it. If pain exists after the blisters are\ngone, put ice on the area.\n- Avoid drafts. Allow sunlight on the area for short intervals. Gently wash the blisters\nwhen bathing and avoid touching or scratching them.\n- If the shingles appear on the forehead, tip of the nose, or near the eyes, contact an\nophthalmologist. Such cases can lead to blindness.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—As John thought of the love of Christ, he was led to exclaim, \"Behold, what\nmanner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" Oh, may\nwe praise Him every day for the overcoming strength He imparts, so we can resist temptation and fulfill\nHis will.",

It is most common between 15 and 25, and is not infectious.\nDo not use steroids, alcohol, or processed foods.\nCAUSES—The skin cells seem to run out of control. Instead of skin renewing itself in 30 days, the new\ncells reach the top layer in 3 days. This produces raised areas of skin, called plaques, which are red and\noften itchy. Because so many cells are rising and dying (as they normally do), they have a raised,\nsilvery, patchy appearance.\nPsoriasis may be linked to faulty fat utilization. Attacks are related to times of stress, illness, surgery,\ncuts, certain viral and bacterial infections, sunburn, poison ivy, or poison oak. The drugs such as\nchloroquine, lithium, and beta-blockers also cause it to flare up.\nThere appears to be a hereditary factor involved.\nPrevious immunizations seem to be a causative factor for some people.",

      "overview": "- There is no certainty that one can totally eliminate psoriasis. Do not spend time worrying\nover the matter, for the resultant stress may only aggravate it.\n- Only the scales and skin debris can be removed. Because psoriatic skin is dry, it is well\nto put petroleum jelly or vegetable oil on the area. Researchers have found that covering\nlesions with tape or plastic wrap for days or weeks can sometimes help clear it up. This\nseems to work only for small areas, no larger than half a dollar. But do not let the area\nbecome gooey and infected.\n- Lose weight if you are overweight. Weight loss helps many who have psoriasis.\n- Heavy stress can make it worse; try to retain a calm, cheerful outlook on life. Existing\npsoriasis tends to get worse when you come down with some other infection.\n- Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light reduces the scaling and redness. With regular\namounts of intense sunlight, 95% of psoriasis sufferers improve. But keep in mind that too\nmuch ultraviolet light also produces skin cancer.\n- You may wish to consider moving to a warmer climate, since the problem becomes\nmuch worse in the winter.\n- An increased intake of animal protein can make it spread outward; conversely, a\nreduction tends to shrink it. Citrus juices may also be a problem.\n- Since psoriasis is a metabolic disease, a cleansing juice fast, 2-3 times for the first week,\nis a good way to begin working toward its recession. Four weeks later, the fast can be\ncarried out again. But in the meantime, an extremely nourishing diet should have been\nstarted. All junk food should have been discarded. Search out, and eliminate, allergy\nfoods. Beware of milk and wheat. It may be well to exclude them for 6 months, even if\nthey may appear harmless.\n- Avoid fats (butter, milk, cream, eggs, meat), processed food, white flour, sugar, and\ncitrus fruit. Red meat and dairy products contain arachidonic acid, which makes the\nlesions turn red and swell. Get your oils from natural foods, such as flaxseed, sesame seed,\nand soybeans.\n- Vitamins A, B complex, C, and D all help the skin and appear to be of help in reducing\npsoriasis.\n- Swimming in the ocean is good for reducing psoriasis. Bathing in heated baths is also\nhelpful, but it also tends to increase the itching. Put seawater, several times a day, on the\narea.\n- The various medicinal drugs recommended for psoriasis all have potentially dangerous\nside effects.\n- To reduce the itching, a cold-water bath, perhaps with a cup or so of vinegar added, is\nvery helpful. Another help is ice. Put some in a plastic sack and hold on the area.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—What greater privilege could be ours than to enter the family of God.

The area is numb, so he will not feel the\nheat. In the early stages, you can rub the area with a cloth dipped in cold water or snow.\n- Do not apply more heat than mentioned above, for the skin is numb and can be burned\nwithout anyone realizing it. Unless it is all you have, do not use dry, radiant heat (such as\na heat lamp or campfire). Frostbitten skin can easily burn, for it does not feel the heat.\n- To warm the hands, place them under your armpits. Roll yourself into a ball to conserve\nheat. Stay out of the wind. Do not get wet. Do not drink or smoke; both block circulation\nto the extremities. If outside, stay in your car or truck until help comes.\n- Living tissue is dying, so thaw the area quickly. Do not allow it to refreeze. Do not take\noff your boots until it is safe to do so. The foot may be swollen and you might not get it\nback on. If considerable walking must be done to find a place of safety, leave the feet\nunthawed until you arrive at your destination.\n- Move the person to a warmer place. Wrap him in blankets.

The same treatment\nshould be applied.\nThe temperature is lowered to subnormal levels for some length of time, resulting in near frostbite.\nSevere numbness and loss of function may occur if the problem is not dealt with. Colds, flu, and\ninfection can result.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Hide within your heart the precious promises of God's Word, and you will be\nstrengthened in time of need. Cling to Christ and trust Him to care for you to the end.\nFELON (Whitlow)\nSYMPTOMS—A swelling on an abscess of a thumb or finger (sometimes a toe), which includes\nthrobbing pain and extreme tenderness. It may, at first, seem to be an infection or inflammation of the\nskin.\nCAUSES—The germs causing the infection are usually carried under the skin by a deep pinprick, thorn,\nsliver, or some other sharp object. The inflammation and pus are deep among the tendons, tendon\nsheaths, or even next to the bone.\nIf the felon is not carefully, and thoroughly, lanced promptly, the tendons could slough or the bone be\ndamaged. This would result in a permanently crippled body part.\nMoreover, if the pus is not drained, there is danger that the infection may travel to the hand and more\nextensive crippling occur, or the infection may infect the blood, and blood poisoning will result.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—The small arteries in the extremities constrict or tighten. The hands and feet are\nextremely sensitive to the cold, and suddenly contract. Lack of oxygenated blood causes the fingers or\ntoes to become whitish or bluish in hue. As a result, the affected area may temporarily shrink in size!\nUnless these attacks are reduced, ulcers may form, which further damage the tissue and produce chronic\ninfection under, and near, the fingernails and toenails.\nThe hands are the areas most often affected. But it can occur in the fingers and possibly toes, nose,\ntongue, cheeks, ears, or chin. The blood spasm may initially blanch the area. Tingling, and then\nswelling, may occur and become painful. The appearance may change to a bright red, as the blood\nvessels again distend and fresh blood is sent back into the area.\nThe attacks usually do not last long. But, in those instances in which they do, gangrene can develop.\nCAUSES—A cold attack is generally brought on by exposure to cold or emotional upset. The hands go\ninto the refrigerator for a moment, a difficult written exam must be taken, or a verbal conflict occurs.\nSpasms of small arteries result.\nThe underlying cause may be less easy to identify. It might be high blood pressure, drugs, connective\ntissue disease, inflammation of the arteries, or equipment vibrations which injure the blood vessels.\nSome individuals have lived in a cold, improperly heated environment for too many months or years,\nand the problem developed. Try to avoid resting or sleeping in ice cold places.\nFood allergies, junk food, or a poor diet which is high in starches and low in greens, vitamins, and\nminerals may cause it.\nApparently the cause is not a \"thoracic inlet syndrome\"; that is, squeezing of nerves or arteries issuing\nfrom the thorax by muscles or bones.\nInstead of Raynaud's, you might have Buerger's disease (a nerve disorder which gradually cuts off nerve\nsupply to the extremities). Buerger's disease is primarily caused by using tobacco products. (Buerger's is\na steady cutting off of nerve flow; whereas Raynaud's is an intermittent blood flow.)\nAntihypertensives, ergot drugs, channel blockers, or alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers can be the\ncause.\nThere are two forms of this condition:\n(1) Raynaud's phenomenon: This may be due to various bodily disorders. It occurs evenly\nin both men and women, and usually begins after the age of 30. Symptoms in the\nphenomenon may affect only one side of the body.\n(2) Raynaud's disease: This is primary disease, and occurs mainly in women. The disease\ngenerally begins in the teens or early twenties. But it can occur at any time in the life.\nAttacks normally affect both sides of the body equally.\nFrequency of the attacks are significant: They may be rare or occur as often as several times a day. Mild\noccurrences only last a few minutes; severe ones may continue for hours. Between attacks the hands will\nat first appear normal; later they may remain slightly bluish. Gradually the attacks will be more frequent\nand last longer.\nIn later years, the hands will be slightly bluish all the time. The fingers become swollen. The skin turns\npale, discolored, shiny, taut, and smooth. The nails become clubbed and deformed. In advanced stages,\npoor blood supply can weaken the fingers and damage the sense of touch. The sense of feel may\ndecrease and delicate movements become more difficult to perform. Infections and gangrene may occur\nmore frequently in the affected area.",

      "overview": "- Keep hands and feet warm. This is important. It might be well to select a warmer climate\nin which to live. Always wear gloves in cold weather (mittens will keep you even\nwarmer). Wear shoes; do not walk without them when it is cooler. Wear extra warm socks\nin the winter. Dress warmly at all times. Gloves, mittens, and shoes should be warm\nbefore putting them on, since it is difficult for one with this problem to warm them. Wear\nshoes which breathe, so you do not end up with damp, cold feet. Wear a warm hat in cold\nweather.\n- Avoid contact with cold objects, even for brief moments. While preparing meals, use\ntepid, not cold, water.\n- When an attack occurs, immerse the body part in warm (not hot) water, no warmer than\n90o F. Why not warmer water? During an attack, without realizing it, one's skin can more\neasily burn.\n- Massaging the hands and fingers every evening helps reduce the severity of the attacks,\nby stimulating blood circulation in that area.\n- Stressful situations produce a spasm of the blood vessels. As much as possible, avoid\nsuch situations. Keep calm, cheerful, and relaxed. Plan ahead and avoid scheduling\npressures. Trust in God and believe He will care for you. Vigorous outdoor exercise will\nstrengthen the entire body, and also relax it. Exercise tends to neutralize the attitude and\neffects of stress.\n- Avoid fatty and fried foods, all junk foods. At least 50% of your diet should be raw food.\nAvoid food items which tend to bother you (allergenic foods). Avoid caffeine (caffeine,\ntea, soft drinks, chocolate). Caffeine restricts blood flow. Use a fat-free, sugar-free diet.\nSugar increases blood viscosity as well as triglycerides. Avoid food seasonings.\n- Do not take any tobacco product or use alcohol. Nicotine causes constriction of the\nblood vessels and it produces plaque in them, both of which reduce blood flow. Do not be\neven in the same room where someone is smoking.\n- Medicinal drugs for Raynaud's do not seem to help. The side effects outweigh the\nbenefits (ergot, beta blocking drugs, cytotoxic agents, etc.). Do not take birth control pills.\n- Avoid machinery which vibrates the hands. In one study, 50% of pneumatic drill\nworkers had Raynaud's, compared with 5.6% for the average population. Such equipment\nincludes chain saws, metal grinders, stone cutters, lathes, and manual typewriters.\n- Drink enough water, but not soft drinks. Eat a high fiber diet which includes some\npsyllium seed, to help clean the colon. Eat slow-cooked grains and a low protein diet.\n- Take vitamin E (80-1,200 unites per day), unsaturated fatty acids alone (wheat germ oil,\netc.), tryptophan.\n- Take calcium (2,000 mg daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg daily). Get enough iron in\nyour diet. (webmaster's Note: It is reported that Zinc is also very helpful in this condition.\nsee http://coldcure.com/html/zinc-angina.pdf )\n- Sprinkle a small amount of cayenne on your food, to increase circulation. Other helpful\nherbs include garlic, ginkgo, biloba extract, and pau d'arco.\n- Sunbathing is also helpful, for it strengthens both the body and the blood.\n- One physician (Donald McIntyre) suggests occasionally swinging the arms in circles, 80\ntwirls per minute, to throw blood into the hands. He says to do it as a pitcher does it:\nswinging the arm up from the back and then hard downward in front. It has been found\nthat those with back problems can swing their arms entirely in front of the body with the\nsame beneficial effect on the hands (upward in the trunk and downward to the side).\n—Also see \"Buerger's Disease.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Talk with Jesus as though He were right by your side. If there is a place you\ncannot go with Jesus, then do not go there. If there is anything you cannot watch or listen to with Him,\nthen turn away from it immediately.\nBUERGER'S DISEASE (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)\nSYMPTOMS—Continual coldness of the extremity is frequently the first symptom. But numbness,\ntingling, and aching may also be noticed. When lowered for long periods of time, the feet may turn blue.\nThe problem generally begins in the feet; but it can, and will, occur in the hands and eventually the\nwhole, body—if the cause is not stopped.\nJews develop this problem more frequently than anyone else, and 75 men have it for every one woman\nwho develops it. It most frequently begins at the ages of 20 to 45. There are alternate periods of\nworsening and inactivity of the disease.\nCAUSES—This is an inflammation of the blood vessel walls, accompanied by blood clots and\nthickening of the blood vessel walls. Eventually they close entirely.\nThe primary cause is the use of tobacco products. Rarely does a non-nicotine user get it.",

Apply some peroxide as a safeguard against infection.\nChange the cotton insert daily, until the nail has grown past the problem area.\n- Do not cut a \"v\"-shaped wedge out of the center of your toenail! It only worsens the\nproblem. Nails grow from back to front, not from inward to outward, or vice-versa.\n- If you accidentally cut or break a nail too short, carefully smooth the edges with an\nemery board.\n- Never cut nails with scissors; none are small enough to do the job right, and they often\nleave a sharp edge.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Prayer and faith can do what no power on earth could ever accomplish. In\nChrist, we can resist temptation and obey the Ten Commandments.\nSection 3\nExtremities\nPart 3\nFeet",

Repeat this 3 times a day (p. 179).\nSweating feet: Apply a Revulsive Douche to the feet, with extremes in temperature as great as possible.\nGive an Alternate hot and cold Foot Bath. During the night, apply a Heating Compress to the feet; and\ngive a Cold Mitten Friction to the feet in the morning, on arising (p. 243).\nWeak, pronated feet: Put the feet and part of the legs in tubs for Contrast Baths. Begin with a\ntemperature of 110o F., and then after four minutes, change to tap water for 1 minute. Change back and\nforth 4-6 times, and end with the hot water. During the treatment, the temperature of the hot water\nshould be gradually raised to 115o-120o F., and the tap water gradually lowered to the temperature of ice\nwater. Give the treatment twice a day (p. 115).\nInfections in feet: Give the same treatment as for pronated feet, above (p. 114).\nENCOURAGEMENT—It is Jesus that we need.

      "overview": "- Wear proper shoes! Never wear tight-fitting footwear!\n- Do not use \"corn plasters.\" These contain acids intended to eat away at the corns. But\nthey also eat into nearby normal flesh.\n- Do not cut corns and calluses! This only makes the situation worse. This especially\napplies to diabetics. As soon as a corn develops, apply oil to soften it.\n- Soak your feet in very diluted chamomile tea. It will both soothe and soften the hard\nskin. (The stain the tea makes on the feet will come off easily with soap and water.) Or\njust soak the feet in comfortably hot water for several minutes. Then apply a hand cream\nwhich contains 20% urea. This will help dissolve the hard skin. Do this daily.\n- Another formula is to soak the area in a mixture of oil of wintergreen, witch hazel, and\nblack walnut tincture, daily. Use a pumice stone and emery board to trim down the corn or\ncallus.\n- Yet another formula is to crush 5-6 aspirin tablets and mix into a paste, by adding a half\nteaspoon each of water and lemon juice. Apply this to the hard-skin areas. Put the foot in a\nplastic bag, wrap a warm towel around it, and sit for 10 minutes. Then unwrap the foot\nand scrub the area with a pumice stone. The dead, hardened flesh should come loose and\nflake off.\n- Put a few drops of citric acid on the area. The next morning, use an emery board or a\npumice stone and rub off the dead skin.\n- A variant method is to soak a piece of cotton in fresh lemon juice or pineapple. Bandage\nthe cotton over the area. It will dissolve it. But you must be persistent.\n- Any sweet oil rubbed on the area several times a day, plus the use of the emery board or\npumice stone, will skim off the dead flesh.\n- Try putting some lamb's wool between the toes, to separate them (after buying larger\nshoes).\n- You can purchase Stella's Stretch All (or another leather-stretching solution) from a shoe\nstore. Apply it to the shoes and then walk in them while wet. Repeat this frequently, and\nthe leather shoe will widen out.\n- Women should never wear high-heel shoes. They ruin the feet, damage the spine, and\nthrow the pelvic organs out of place.\n- Women should not wear pumps; these are shoes which cause the foot to slide forward,\njamming everything into the front. Instead, wear an oxford-style shoe, with laces. This\nproperly cradles the foot.\n- Always buy shoes which breathe; leather is the best.\n- An undersized shoe will damage the toes and cause corns, etc. An oversized shoe will\nproduce friction and break the skin. But, of the two, oversized shoes are the less harmful.\n- Some calluses are useful, never painful, and should not be disturbed.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We are seldom placed in the same position twice. There are continually new\nexperiences to be encountered. But, if we will trust in Christ, He will enable us to overcome sin in spite\nof all that comes our way.",

Garlic is better than antifungal drugs!\n- Try to keep your feet cool and dry. You may be able to think of ways to do this. Try to\nfind shoes that will not make your feet sweat. Avoid rubber shoes, even the expensive\nones.\n- Fungi hates sunlight. When in the acute stage, try to leave your feet uncovered.

They create a warm, moist place for fungus to\nbreed. Never wear boots all day.\n- Do not wear the same shoes 2 days in a row. This gives a pair of shoes 2 days to\nthoroughly dry out.\n- Spray Lysol on a cloth and wipe the inside of the shoe.\n- Place the shoes in the sunlight, angled toward the sun. Ultraviolet light kills fungus.\n- Useful herbs are blood root and goldenseal; use alone or together.

Sometimes it results in a swollen face, stuffy nose, and a thick\nmucous discharge.\nCAUSES—The nasal sinuses are located in the bones surrounding the eyes and nose. They help your\nvoice sound fuller and richer. They also help store overflow phlegm in time of illness.\nSinusitis is an inflammation of the nasal sinuses that generally occurs together with upper respiratory\ninfection. Colds or bacterial and viral infections spread into the sinuses.\nSinus problems which have become chronic may be caused by injury of the nasal bones, smoking, small\ngrowths in the nose, or irritant fumes and odors.\nAllergenic sinusitis may result from plant pollens (hay fever) or allergies to milk; dairy products; or, less\nlikely, wheat.\nAn over-acid condition in the stomach can cause sinus troubles. Poor digestion of starch, sugar, and\ndairy products can produce a runny nose. When force is used in blowing the nose, phlegm is pushed up\ninto the sinuses.\nSwimming or diving can force phlegm up into the sinuses.\nAllergic rhinitis is a common cause of sinusitis. Avoid substances which might be giving you allergies.\nDecayed teeth, enlarged and infected adenoids, cigarette smoke, perfume, household cleansers, and\ndusty air can cause irritation to the sinuses.\nSo sinus trouble can either be caused by an infection or by other things. If drainage is clear after a week,\nyou probably have no infection; but, if mucous is greenish or yellowish, you do. If drainage is clear and\nthere are no accompanying symptoms of a common cold, you probably have an allergy.\nFew people with sinus trouble have actual sinus infection (sinusitis).\nBeware of swelling around the eyes! If left untreated, this can lead to bronchitis, asthma, throat\ninfection, or pneumonia.\nIf you are interested in figuring out which sinuses may be bothering you, here is some helpful data:\nFrontal sinuses produce frontal headaches which are most severe between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\nMaxillary sinuses makes pain in the upper teeth and cheek, and sometimes eye pain as well. It generally\nlasts from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.\nEthmoid sinuses induce a dull pain behind the eyes, pain in eye movements, tearing, light sensitivity,\nand occasionally sore throat and nighttime cough.",

Drink fresh carrot juice every day.\n- Eliminate meat, dairy products, white flour foods, and sugar.\n- Do not use nose drops; they aggravate the situation by stopping the drainage and\nhardening the mucous. Decongestants also increase blood pressure.\n- Hot liquids help the sinuses flow out their contents.\n- Helpful herbs to reduce sinus congestion would include comfrey, slippery elm,\nfenugreek, mullein, aloe vera, yerba santa, red clover, and white oak bark.\n- Garlic contains a chemical which makes mucous less sticky. Horseradish has it also.\nCayenne acts in a somewhat similar manner. Peppermint tea also helps open up the sinus\npassageways.\n- Add crushed garlic cloves to 4 cups water; remove from the heat after coming to a boil.\nCool and gradually drink. This will help clean out the sinuses and lower stuffiness.\n- Heat on the sinuses helps relieve pain. This can be hot wet compresses, a heat lamp, a 60watt light bulb, or a heating pad.\n- A variation of this is: Twice a day, lean over a pan of hot water with a towel draped over\nyour head (or stand in a hot shower). Inhale the vapors as they waft up toward your nose.\nIf you are at work, order a cup of something hot; and, leaning over, sniff up the moisture.\n- Some prefer cold applications to the sinuses, instead of hot ones. Put crushed ice in a\nplastic sack, wrap in a moist towel, and place over the sinus which hurts. At the same\ntime, have the feet in hot water. This will help draw blood from the sinus area. However,\nthe hot method is better for draining the sinuses.\n- Mix 1 tsp. of salt with 2 cups warm water. Pour it into a small glass; and, holding back\nyour head, sniff it up into one nostril (as you pinch the other one closed). Repeat for the\nother side.\n- Rubbing your sore sinuses brings a fresh supply of blood to the area. Press your thumbs\nfirmly on either side of your nose and hold for 15-30 seconds.\n- Sit with your head between your knees. Cough gently as though you were clearing your\nthroat. Then hold your breath for a minute or so, as the mucous slowly drains. Then gently\ninhale. Be sure you are drinking enough fluids when you do this.\n- Walking helps clear your sinuses.\n- Between meals every day, take six charcoal tablets with water. This will help remove\ntoxins. Only do this during the crisis, or it can cause temporary constipation.\n- It is better to sniffle than to blow your nose. If you must blow, only blow lightly and\nthrough one nostril at a time.\n- A humidifier will help keep sinuses moist indoors during the winter months. A humidity\nof 40-50% will increase sinus comfort.\n- Avoid cold, damp living, working, and sleeping quarters.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Ask God to do for you those things which you cannot do for yourself. Tell\nJesus everything. Lay open before Him the secrets of your heart, for His eye reads it all. Surrender your\nlife to Him, and let Him enable you to obey His Ten Commandment law.\nSection 4\nHead and Throat\nPart 2\nHair\nBALDNESS and HAIR LOSS (Alopecia)\nSYMPTOMS—It is hair on the head that we are concerned with here. There are several types of hair\nloss: baldness or loss of hair (alopecia). Loss of all scalp hair (alopecia totalis). Hair falling out in\npatches (alopecia areata). Another type of hair loss is localized and is due to scarring. Alopecia most\nfrequently occurs in men, but occasionally in women. Most common of all is the standard male pattern\nof baldness and the female pattern of baldness.\nA single hair generally lasts 2-6 years, and is then replaced by a new hair. When baldness begins, there\nis an excess of shorter, thinner hair—the kind babies have on their head.\nRemember that it is normal to lose as much as 100 hairs a day. Once the hair follicle dies, it never again\nproduces hair. But there are instances in which the follicle has not died, but only has stopped producing\nhair. Careful treatment restores hair growth.\nCAUSES—Heredity (especially in men), hormonal factors, aging, or local or systemic disease.\nLocalized hair loss could also be caused by scarring following a wound or an operation.\nOther factors include poor circulation, high fever or other acute illness, surgery, radiation (X-ray\ntherapy), medicinal drugs, anesthesia, drastic reducing diets, stress (depletes B vitamins), poor diet, skin\ndisease, sudden weight loss, iron deficiency, thyroid disease, obesity, birth control pills, diabetes, or\nvitamin deficiency. A nourishing diet should be eaten daily.\nA significant cause of baldness is the use of hair dyes. Another is using hot air dryers.\nHair loss in women most often occurs after menopause. Some women lose some hair 2-3 months after\nchildbirth because hormonal changes, during late term, tended to block normal hair loss; this is reversed\nwithin 6 months.\nHypothyroidism can cause hair loss. Too little vitamin A can cause hair loss, and too much can do it\nalso.",

      "overview": "- The circulation in the scalp (which is poorer in men than in women) needs to be\nimproved. Massaging the scalp daily helps. Keep the scalp and hair clean; however, do not\nwash the hair too frequently. Avoid excess shampooing.\n- There should be adequate protein in the diet (especially vegetable seeds, such as sesame,\npumpkin, sunflower, almonds), brewer's yeast and fresh brewer's yeast; but, as with\neverything, do not go overboard. (People in the U.S. eat more protein than anyone else,\nyet they have the greatest hair loss.)\n- A variety of factors affect hair loss. Minerals and vitamins are also important for hair\ngrowth. Take a good supplement at least twice a day. Drink fresh vegetable juice at least\nonce a day. Take vitamin A (50,000 units daily). Several B vitamins especially affect hair\ngrowth and color. Eat sea kelp or dulse. biotin, inositol, niacin, vitamin E, and PABA are\nalso important.\n- Oatstraw and horsetail tea are rich in silicon and trace minerals. Rosemary helps prevent\npremature baldness and stimulate head circulation. Sage is an astringent, and helps\nstimulate growth. Yarrow helps liver activity.\n- Avoid salt, sugar, tobacco, and alcohol. Overconsumption of salt and sugar increases\ndandruff and hair loss. Avoid large amounts of vitamin A (100,000 units daily over long\nperiods).\n- Beware of the drug, minoxidil. Although given to restore scalp hair, it is high-priced and\nmay cause heart damage. The hair it produces is of a poor quality, and tends to fall out\nwhen the drug is terminated.\n- Some people put a little cayenne pepper on their scalp. It surely will bring the blood, and\nmight even produce some hair! But it may get in the eyes! Most people are not prepared to\ndeal with this extreme method.\n- There are others who stand on their head to bring the blood there! It is reported that this\nalso helps. Do not do it at work, or folks will think you are crazy. (And, of course, too\nmuch of this would not be good for the brain.) Others lie on slant boards for a time each\nday.\nHere are more suggestions:\n- Try rubbing the juice of a quince on the bald area every day. Eat flaxseed and drink sage\ntea. Iodine (in Norwegian kelp or Nova Scotia dulse) in your diet may help. Rub bald\nspots with kerosene once a day. For falling hair, try wetting the scalp daily with strong\nrosemary, sage or white oak bark tea.\n- But, first and foremost, you need to go on a cleansing juice program for a couple days,\nand clean the bowels. Then only eat nourishing food, and no more processed junk.\n- It is said that you must faithfully do your selected hair treatment for two months before\nyou will see results.\n- Never use strong soaps or hair sprays. Only use mild castile soaps.\n- Hats and wigs are apt to cause hair to fall out faster, since they limit the air to the scalp.\n- One natural remedies expert gives this advice: \"Eat all raw food, massage your scalp\noften in the sun, wiggle your ears a lot, and stand on your head or lie on a slant board.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Happiness from earthly sources is constantly changeable. But Christ can give\nyou peace and rest which is beyond compare. Let Him, by faith, dwell in your heart.",

Shade your screen by placing a hood over the front.\n- Every so often, shut and rest your eyes. Try \"palming.\" To do this, place the palms\nacross your open eyes, without touching them. This cuts out all light and enables you to\nmomentarily rest them from all light.\n- Make sure you blink often enough. Each blink cleanses and refreshes them.\n- Refuse to strain your eyes.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—The lens of the eye becomes clouded, so that the eye is unable to properly focus on\nobjects. In advanced cases, the lens is becoming opaque, so that blindness is setting in. Only part of the\neye is generally cloudy or opaque, but this can gradually extend to the entire eye.\nCAUSES—The most common cause is senility.\nCongenital cataracts occur if the mother had rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, or if the\ninfant has galactosemia (inherited inability to digest galactose [a type of milk sugar, resulting from\nlactose] properly). These cataracts generally do not get worse. Not using milk products at all can help\nprevent this in adults.\nTraumatic cataracts result from blows which rupture the anterior lens capsule, harmful chemicals,\nintense infrared radiation, or X rays. Radiation causes free radical damage in the eyes. This causes the\nlens to absorb aqueous humor. The lens becomes cloudy and must be removed, to restore eyesight.\nPeople living closer to the South Pole (which has part of its ozone layer stripped away) are more likely\nto develop cataracts.\nOther causes include hypoparathyroidism, Down's syndrome, and atopic dermatitis. The longer one has\ndiabetes, the greater the risk of cataracts.\nHair dye has been shown to cause cataracts. Only 23% of those not dying their hair get cataracts;\nwhereas 89% of those who dye their hair develop them.\nComplications of tumors, detached retina, iritis, glaucoma, and severe myopia can also bring it on.\nOther studies reveal that people with stress, allergies, or who eat seafood (thus ingesting methylmercury)\nare more likely to develop cataracts.\nIt is now known that a reduction in vitamin C or B in the diet can help produce cataracts. High blood\n2\nsugar levels and low calcium levels can also bring it on.",

Do not drink milk or eat cheese, ice cream, seafood, or\ngrease. Get enough vitamins E, C, B complex (B is very important!), selenium, zinc,\n2\nbioflavonoids, 1-glutamine, 1-arginine, 1-cysteine, and glutathione. If diabetes is\ninvolved, add chromium supplementation. Avoid excess cholesterol, sorbitol (artificial\nsweetener), unsaturated fatty acids, and mercury tooth fillings (amalgam).\n- Higher blood sugar levels in diabetics and hypoglycemics causes the cells in the lense to\nabsorb large amounts of glucose.

      "overview": "- There appears to be no evidence that restoration of vision, lost through glaucoma-caused\nnerve degeneration, can be restored. But there are things which can be done to slow or\nstop the advance of this problem.\n- Dietetic problems are among the most common causes of glaucoma. This includes\novereating, eating the wrong foods, and not eating the right ones. Emphasize a raw,\nvitamin C rich, diet.\n- Food \"allergies,\" eating foods which do not agree with the system, can be a frequent\ncause of the disease. Do a pulse test and find out which foods may be causing you\nproblems. In addition, a tonometer can be purchased, which you can use to test your\neyeball pressure.\n- The diet should include betaine HCl, vitamin C, a good vitamin/mineral supplement,\nvitamin A, vitamin B , and nourishing, natural food—but not too much of it.\n2\n- Moderate, daily out-of-door, exercise helps reduce pressure.\n- Warm fennel herb, alternated with chamomile and eyebright, is helpful. Apply as\neyewash in an eyecup or three drops to each eye, 3 times a day.\n- If anxiety seems to be a cause, increase the B complex intake. Avoid stress, worry, fear,\nand anger. Cultivate a tranquil, restful lifestyle. Great temperature changes (as found in\nthe north) are a source of stress.\n- Higher blood sugar levels increase pressure.\n- Avoid heavy lifting, pulling, etc. Avoid constipation, for straining at the stool increases\neye pressure (as does diarrhea). Maintain a slight, mild laxative effect. Avoid sitting or\nstanding still for long periods. Lying face down significantly increases pressure. Standing\non the hands astoundingly increases pressure.\n- Increased blood pressure brings increased pressure within the eyeball. Keep your blood\npressure down!\n- Do not use the eyes intensively for long periods of time (TV viewing or excessive\nreading).\n- Avoid coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and all junk and processed foods. Smoking damages\neyes which have glaucoma. Tobacco in the system increases intraocular pressure. Avoid\nspicy foods.\n- Avoid excessive fluid intake (juice, water, milk, etc.) at any one time. Drink only small\namounts, and only an hour apart.\n- Motion sickness medication patches increase eyeball pressure.\n- Those with glaucoma do well to remain under the care of a professional. Every time the\npressure increases, a little more eyesight is permanently lost.\nENCOURAGEMENT—No difficulty can hinder you, if you are determined to seek first the kingdom\nof God and His righteousness.

      "overview": "Anterior nosebleeds (from the nose itself) are most common:\n- Blow out the clots, then sit in a chair and lean forward without tilting the head back. (If\nyou lie down or lean backward, you will swallow blood.) Put a small piece of wet cotton\n(or cloth) in the nose and pinch lightly on it for 5 minutes. Then apply cold washcloths or\nan ice pack to the nose, cheek, and neck. (Another suggestion is to have him lightly sniff\ncold water with a little salt or lemon juice added.)\n- Then apply vitamin E oil (or petroleum jelly) to the inside of the nose. Lie back and rest\nfor a time. If the nosebleeds are serious enough to warrant it, rest as much as you can for\ntwo days.\n- The rupture in the blood vessel that caused the nosebleed requires 7-10 days to\ncompletely heal. When the bleeding stops, a clot forms and then becomes a scab. Do not\npick it loose.\n- Make sure you are getting enough vitamin K in the diet. It is found in all dark greens.\nPut lactobacillus acidophilus in the colon. It will synthesize, and thus increase, the amount\nof vitamin K in your body.\n- Be sure to take enough vitamin C. Calcium, magnesium, alfalfa, and vitamin E are also\nimportant.\n- When the nose dries out excessively, nosebleed can occur. Try increasing the humidity\nin the room. Consider purchasing a humidifier. Smoking dries out the nasal membranes.\n- Medicinal blood thinners can cause nosebleeds. Blood thinner drugs are what you find in\nD-Con rat poison.\n- White oak bark (or bayberry or ephedra sinica) tea is an astringent. It can be snuffed up\nthe nose before inserting the cotton.\n- A little cayenne can be swallowed in some water. This will draw blood away from the\nhead to the stomach.\nThe other type is the posterior nosebleed:\n- This occurs in the elderly, and is caused by high blood pressure. The bleeding starts in\nthe rear of the nose, and runs down into the throat. The blood pressure must be lowered!\nIncrease water intake and see a physician.\n- Keep in mind that a posterior nosebleed is far better than having a blood vessel rupture\nfrom high blood pressure—inside the cranial cavity. Then you have a stroke!\nWhichever type of nosebleed may occur, here are additional suggestions:\n- Those with frequent nosebleeds should take extra iron. It is needed to make hemoglobin.\nRutin is also needed.\n- Avoid oral contraceptives. Anything that changes estrogen levels can make you more\nprone to nosebleeds.\nHYDRO—Here are several treatments for nosebleed, discussed in the author's book, Water Therapy\nManual ( see order sheet):\n- Contrast Bath to the Hand or Arm. Two very deep pails may be used. The hot water\nshould be as hot as can be borne (p. 114).\n- Hot Foot Bath. This can also be used to stop a nosebleed (p. 116).\n- Cold Plantar Douche. This is a cold water spray to the bottom of the feet (p. 166).\n- Ice Bag to back of the neck; short hot Fomentations to the face (p. 218).\n- Ice to the back of the neck; Hot Compress over face; ice to hands; elevate hands to\nvertical position, if necessary; Hot Foot Bath or Hot Leg Pack; very Hot Nasal Douche (p.\n224).\nENCOURAGEMENT—If we are in Christ, we are heaven-bound.

Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nNOTE—This section deals with methods of reducing blood congestion in the middle ear and inner ear,\nand was taken, with slight adaptation, from Dr. William L. McKie's book, Scientific Hydrotherapy, page\n55.\nDRAINING THE MIDDLE EAR—Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and\nface, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the Hot Compress\nextends below the jaw, the common carotid will be dilated (enlarged), which you do not want. An Ice\nBag should be placed below the jaw at the same time. This will increase the effect, by contracting the\ncarotid.\nDRAINING THE INNER EAR—The internal ear, receiving its blood supply from the vertebral artery,\na branch of the subclavian, is not affected by heat over the ear. But the inner ear problem may be\nrelieved, when congested, by warm applications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back\nof the neck, thus diverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or\nan ice bag to the back of the neck.\n—Also see \"Earache and Infection.\"\nEARACHE and INFECTION; MASTOIDITIS (Otitis Externa and Media)\nSYMPTOMS—One or both ears ache. This is frequently accompanied by infection in the middle ear.\nThe pain will be worse at night because the body is prone (flat) and it is more difficult for the eustachian\ntubes to drain out the phlegm.\nSometimes the ears will ache because there is trouble with the teeth (referred pain), but this is not\ncommon.\nCAUSES—Infection of the outer or middle ear causes pressure to build up. This pressure on nerve\nendings causes pain. But, if there were no pain, there might be no warning that a serious ear problem\nexisted.\nOtitis externa is infection in the outer ear. The eardrum through the length of the eustachian tube\nbecomes swollen and inflamed. There is a slight fever, discharge from the ear, pain (which increases\nwhen the ear is touched or pulled), and temporary loss of hearing.\nOtitis media is infection in the middle ear, and is especially common in infants and children. The\ninfection is located behind the eardrum, where the small ear bones are located. There is earache,\nfullness, pressure in the ear, and a fever as high as 103o F. or higher.\nHere is an ear test: if you can wiggle your outer ear (the part you can see) without pain, you probably\nhave a middle ear infection; if there is pain, the infection is in the eustachian tube.\nGoing into higher altitudes can push phlegm, already in the eustachian tube, into the middle ear. Never\nsleep on your ear if you have a head cold and the vehicle is moving upward to a higher elevation.\nInfection in the inner ear generally results from meningitis or from the spread of a middle-ear infection.\nSymptoms include loss of hearing, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and fever.\nEarache is a common childhood infection. Most children experience it. It is easier for a child to have an\near infection, since his eustachian tube is shorter than that of an adult. Causes include childhood\ndiseases, allergies, colds, and respiratory infections.\nIf they are frequent, ear infections can lead to loss of hearing.\nChronically enlarged adenoids may cause blockage of the eustachian tubes, leading to congestion and\nfluid buildup in the middle ear.\nThere is a tendency for people who have ear problems to be heavy earwax producers. To reduce the\namount of earwax made, eat less unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are not a problem.",

      "overview": "- If you seem to have pain in the ear, pull on the earlobe. If the pain increases, then you\nprobably have an ear infection. If the pain does not increase, you may have a dental\nproblem.\n- Keep the ears warm and the person resting in bed, preferably with his head and, perhaps\nalso, his trunk slightly elevated (to assist natural drainage of the eustachian tubes).\nSurgical draining might be necessary. The fever increases the need for vitamins A and C.\nKeep the feet warm. Heat applied to the feet will draw blood from the head and improve\ncirculation.\n- Sit up when practical to do so, to decrease the swelling and start the tubes draining.\nSwallowing will help ease the pain. Yawning really helps open up the eustachian tubes.\n- Blow warm air from a hair dryer 18-30 inches from the ear, and blow air toward it.\n- Warm some oil to body temperature, and place a drop or two in the ear. This will help\nlessen pain. But do not do this if you think the drum has burst!\n- A helpful method, used by many for a long time is this: To alleviate pain in the ear, use a\nlittle olive oil or garlic oil in the ear, then add a drop or two of lobelia tincture.\n- Another way to reduce pain is to make a paste, using onion powder or clay packs. Then\napply this to the outside of the ear.\n- Bake a large onion until it becomes soft, and tie it over the ear; this will often give great\nrelief when pain is severe.\n- Avoid sugar, dairy products, meat, and heavy meals until the crisis is past. Herbal teas\nare helpful in assisting the healing process. This includes peppermint, echinacea,\ngoldenseal, pau d'arco, and slippery elm.\n- Because they increase sticky mucous in the body, dairy products increase ear infections.\nExcessive sweets and starches lower resistance and intensify ear problems.\n- People with a tendency to ear infection should avoid all cow's milk products. But, in\naddition to producing so much mucous, it is reported that milk allergies can produce\nearaches (and even a burst eardrum), simulating otitis media—without an ear infection\nactually existing.\n- Avoid cigarette smoke, for it can irritate the eardrum.\n- Place drops of hydrogen peroxide in the ear, to help clean it out. Then rinse out with\nwater. Do not leave the peroxide there. It can sink through the eardrum and produce a\nfizzing sound which can last for several years.\n- Take garlic enemas. These will help disinfect the body of higher levels of toxins that are\nbuilding up from the infection. Signs of this are chills, fever, general aches, and pain\nincrease.",

      "overview": "What should you do if the eardrum ruptures? Causes include a severe ear infection, sudden pressure\ninward on the ear, resulting from diving, slapping, a strong kiss to the ear, or a nearby explosion.\nDuring an ear infection, pus builds up and causes pain in the ear. If this pus starts leaking to the outside,\nthen the eardrum has ruptured.\n- In case the eardrum ruptures, put nothing in the ear until the eardrum is healed. A\nfomentation on the outside of the ear can be helpful.\n- Once the infection increases to acute pain, you may need antibiotics.\n- An alternate method is: When the ear has abscessed and broken, use warm peroxide to\nwash the ear out. The peroxide will loosen the putrefied matter and bring it out of the ear.\nThis method is probably good for cleaning out the ear; but keep in mind that hydrogen\nperoxide is best used on outside body surfaces, where oxygen can cause it to fizz into\nharmlessness. When it gets inside sensitive body parts, it can continue there for quite\nsome time. We know of one individual who had peroxide in his ear for several years\nthereafter; and, every so often, he could hear it lightly fizzing.\n- When using water therapy on the ear, be guarded. Hot applications over the area under\nthe ear could cause trouble!\n- Also see \"Swimmer's Ear.\"\nHYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments mentioned in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual\n(see order sheet):\nIrrigation of the Ear: A lean rubber tube is used to gently (gently!) introduce a flow of\nwater onto the outer ear. The water is never applied with any pressure! It flows to the ear\nand out to the side. The temperature may be from 100o to 120o F., depending upon the\neffect desired. The source of water should be on a level with the top of the head (to\nmaintain only a slight pressure). Never use force, because perforation of the ear often\nexists; and serious injury could result from introduction of water, with any degree of\nforce, into the middle ear. The head should be inclined to the side as the water is applied.\nThe canal of the ear should afterward be carefully dried and covered with a cloth or a\nwarm hand for a few minutes. In cold weather, the ear should not be exposed out-of-doors\nfor at least an hour after warm ear irrigation is applied; and, even after that, a small piece\nof cotton should be placed in the outer passageway.\nThis measure affords great relief in the pain of acute otitis media and earache due to other\ncauses. In chronic suppurative disease of the ear, this measure is indispensable as a means\nof cleansing and disinfection (p. 151).\nDraining the middle ear: Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and\nface, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the\nHot Compress extends below the jaw, the common carotid artery will be dilated\n(enlarged), which you do not want. An ice bag should be placed below the jaw at the same\ntime, and will increase the effect by contracting the carotid.\nDraining the inner ear: The inner ear problem may be relieved, when congested, by warm\napplications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back of the neck, thus\ndiverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or an\nice bag to the back of the neck (p. 194).\nInflammation of ear: Fomentation over affected part; derivative treatment to legs: Hot Leg\nBath, Hot Foot Bath, Prolonged Leg Pack (p. 210).\nInflammation of middle ear: Ice to throat of the same side, Fomentation over ear (p. 221).\nEarache: Ice Bag to the neck of the same side; Fomentation over ear; Hot Ear Douche, if\nnecessary. Protect the ear with warm cotton, to prevent chilling by evaporation after\ntreatment (p. 224).\nEustachian tube inflammation: The Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold\ncloth, covered with flannel, which then heats up and results in improved circulation and a\nbetter flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted area. Wring the cotton cloth\nfrom cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3 thicknesses about\nthe neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit the\nflannel snugly but not too tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it\nthe next morning. It should be entirely dry. In eustachian tube inflammation, the compress\nshould extend upward about the lower part of the ear. You may need to hold up this part\nof the compress (the part by the lower part of the ear) with a bandage that is fastened to it\nand goes over the top part of the head and back down to it on the other side (pp. 51-53).",

They can puncture the eardrum.\n- Do not use cotton-tipped swabs either, because they merely ram the wax down deeper\nand impact it the more.\n- Place something in your ear which will soften it. This can be hydrogen peroxide, mineral\noil, or glycerin. Add a drop or two of this to each ear. Let the excess run out. The liquid\nleft inside will soften the wax. Do this for a couple days.\n- Fill a bowl with body-temperature water. Suck it into a rubber bulb syringe; and, holding\nyour head over the bowl, gently squirt the water into the ear. Use very, very little pressure.\nTurn your head and let the water run out.\n- Do not rub the ears, to dry them. Either use a hair dryer (18-20 inches away) or drop a\nlittle alcohol in each ear. Do not wash out the ears in this manner more often than every\ncouple months. You need some earwax to protect your ears.\n- There is a tendency for people who have ear problems to be heavy earwax producers. To\nreduce the amount of earwax made, eat less unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty\nacids are not a problem. It is the over-balance of unsaturated fats which causes the earwax\nproblem.\n- An alternate method of cleaning out the earwax is this: Using an eyedropper, place either\na solution of 1 part vinegar to 1 part warm water or a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in\nyour ear. Allow it to settle for a minute, then drain it. Do this 2-3 times a day. If the wax is\nhard and dry, apply garlic oil for a day or two, to soften it. Then wash out the ear with a\nsteady stream of warm water, under no pressure. Patiently continue irrigating the ear\ncanal, flushing with warm water. The wax buildup will come out.\n- Yet another method is using \"ear candles,\" available at health food stores. Someone will\nhave to help you use them. Instructions come with the candles. Afterward, you may be\nbothered by the fact that an excess of wax has been eliminated.

Sometimes\nthere is an uncontrollable horizontal jerking of the eyeballs.\nThe condition may affect one or both ears. It generally occurs in adults (most often in women, 50-60\nyears old). The onset is sudden. It may last for hours or weeks, and then return soon again, after years. In\nmost instances, it is experienced only in one ear, and can result in complete deafness in that ear.\nVertigo is the sensation that the world is turning around you. Meniere's syndrome accounts for 10-15%\nof all vertigo (and 5% of all dizziness).\n(Also see \"Vertigo.\")\nCAUSES—This often results from a metabolic problem, resulting from a disturbed carbohydrate\nmetabolism, such as is found in hypoglycemia.\nImpaired blood flow to the brain may be a causative factor.

This is a tumor-like\ngrowth in the middle ear, which gradually pushes on the central nervous system. Consulting with a\nspecialist might be of help in diagnosing the cause.\nIn some instances this is misdiagnosed; and it is actually salicylism, from excessive self-medication of\naspirin.

Whatever the cause, stress sometimes adds to it.\nTinnitus is not a sign of a more serious problem or a precursor of any serious disease—unless it is\nassociated with Meniere's Disease (which see).",

      "overview": "- Surgical success rates are very low. Beware of \"tinnitus maskers.\" These products can\ncause hearing loss.\n- Do the pulse test to check on problem foods. Have a hair analysis made. Find the cause\nand eliminate it. A 1981 medical study pointed to coffee, tea, tonic water, red wine, grainbased spirits, chocolate, and cheese as the most common dietary causes of tinnitus.\n- Mix 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. glycerin in 1 pint warm water. Several times a day, using a\nnasal sprayer, spray each nostril until it begins draining into the back of the throat; also\nspray the throat.\n- Get a nourishing diet, and include trace minerals (Norwegian kelp or Nova Scotia dulse),\nvitamin A, calcium, magnesium, and betaine HCl.\n- A lack of manganese can cause deafness, dizziness, and ear noises. A lack of magnesium\ncan produce nerve twitching and sensitivity to noise.\n- Changing and correcting the diet, reducing stress, and getting more exercise out-of-doors\nhas been helpful in dealing with tinnitus. Stress causes more adrenaline to be produced\nwhich, in turn, constricts blood vessels and keeps waste products from being as quickly\neliminated.\n- Remember that fatigue increases the problem. An important help is to go to bed and get\nup on a regular, healthful, schedule.\n- Avoid loud noises and noisy situations. Alcohol makes tinnitus worse. Caffeine is a\ncommon cause. Marijuana and cocaine intensify the problem. Aspirin is a known cause of\ntinnitus, also blood pressure and arthritis drugs. Also beware of steroids, anticonvulsive\nmedications, vasodilators, and anticholesterol drugs. Nicotine damages the hearing.\n- Make sure the colon is working well. An enema will help with this.\n- Worthwhile herbs would include bugleweed, garlic, gotu kola, cayenne, and prickly ash.\n—Also see \"Meniere's Disease.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ desires to give you the riches of eternal life with Him.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—The throat becomes sore and scratchy. This is often the first sign of an infection.\nCAUSES—A variety of bacterial or virus infections can cause sore throat. Those which are of\nStreptococcus Group A origin tend to produce a higher fever than viral sources (upper respiratory\ninfections, cold viruses, flu, etc.).\nAnything irritating to the throat can initiate the problem (such as chronic coughing and loud talking).\nOther irritants include smoke, dust, fumes, very hot foods or drinks, abrasions, tooth and gum infections,\nloud talking, or chronic coughing.\nSmoking is a major cause of sore throats.\nBacteria on toothbrushes can cause sore throats. Buy a new toothbrush or boil the old one at least once a\nmonth. Between uses, store the toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide—but rinse it well before using.\nIf a sore throat continues or recurs, it might be the onset of mononucleosis (especially if the sore throat\nlasts more than 2 weeks). Do not dally; go to bed and get well. A sore throat can be the first sign of\nsomething more serious: a cold; the flu; mononucleosis; herpes simplex; Epstein-Barr virus; or several\nchildhood diseases, such as chickenpox or the measles. Sometimes a sore throat can lead to chronic\nfatigue syndrome, gingivitis, epiglottitis, diphtheria, laryngeal cancer, or an abscess around the tonsils.\nA continual throat tickle could be an indication of a food allergy.",

Go to bed, rest, trust\nin God, and get well.\n- Use a mixture of raw honey and lemon juice, to coat and soothe the throat.\n- Gargle alternately with chlorophyll liquid and sea salt (one half tsp. in a glass of warm\nwater) every few hours.\n- Enemas are very helpful.\n- Herbs include eucalyptus, flaxseed, garden sage, German chamomile, and myrtle. Both\ngoldenseal and echinacea fight bacterial and viral infection. (But do not take goldenseal\nover a week at a time, or during pregnancy.) Gargling with fenugreek tea will help relieve\na sore throat. Marshmallow root tea soothes a scratchy, itchy throat. Hot mullein poultices\nsoothe sore throats.\n- An old herb doctor makes these suggestions: Gargle the throat with cayenne pepper tea,\na half tsp. to a cup. Put an onion poultice on the neck over night, for 2-3 nights. Rub\nkerosene on the outside of the neck and cover it with warm flannel.\nHYDRO—The following is from the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):\nThe Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold cloth, covered with flannel, which then heats\nup and results in improved circulation and a better flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted\narea. Wring the cotton cloth from cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3\nthicknesses about the neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit\nthe flannel snugly but not so tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it the next\nmorning. It should be entirely dry (pp. 51-53).\nGive a Hot Foot Bath (p. 116).\nA Steam Bath is very helpful (pp. 131-135).\nENCOURAGEMENT—With the trusting faith of a little child, come to your heavenly Father.

The voice loss is frequently all that happens, and no fever or\ninfection accompanies it.\nCAUSES—\"Hoarseness\" is when it is with difficulty that you can speak; \"aphonia\" is when you have\ntotally lost your voice. The cause of either is generally too much loud speaking, yelling, or the onset of a\ncold or upper respiratory tract infection.",

Place a strawberry on the toothbrush and brush as usual.\n- Brush with charcoal powder.\n- Clean your teeth after every meal.\n- Polish them with baking soda. Many of the stains are acid in nature, and the soda\nneutralizes and removes them.\n- Rinse the food from your mouth after each meal.\n- An electric toothbrush removes more plaque than regular brushing.\n- Keep in mind that hard brushing can scratch your tooth enamel. The super-whitening\ntooth abrasives take off even more. Be careful. You want white teeth, but you also want\nteeth.\n- Since we are on the subject of ruining your teeth, an excellent way to melt your teeth is\nto drink cola drinks. They contain phosphoric acid, which has a double whammy effect on\nyour poor teeth! The acid melts your alkaline teeth; and the phosphorous immediately\nlocks into the calcium melted off, and carries it away. Place a tooth in Coca Cola, and it\nwill be gone in a short time.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We need to come into the audience chamber of the Most High, and ask\nforgiveness for our sins.

But we must not waver in our loyalty to Him.\nTOOTH DECAY (Dental Caries; Toothache)\nSYMPTOMS—A cavity or hole develops in a tooth, but may not be noticed until it begins to be\npainful.\nCAUSES—The outer part of the tooth (the very hard enamel) erodes, and then the body of the tooth\nbeneath it (the dentin) begins eroding also. This is called tooth decay.\nIt is thought that plaque buildup (a sticky mass on the surface of the tooth) provides a place for bacteria\nto grow and feed on sugars in the mouth. The acid they produce digs holes in the teeth. If not stopped,\nthe erosion enters the lower, center part of the tooth, called the pulp, where the nerve is. Then the pain\nbegins. We call it a toothache.\nHowever, certain things help produce tooth decay. These include sugary foods, sticky foods, and acid\nfoods.\nCola drinks do an excellent job of melting teeth. Coca Cola, and similar cola beverages, contain\nphosphoric acid and lots of sugar. Frankly, the fluid is so terribly acid that it would be intolerable\nwithout lots of sugar to mask the acidity. Acid, sugar, and phosphorous are very dangerous when\ncombined. The powerful acid melts part of the teeth, and the phosphorous chemically locks with the\nmelted calcium, and quickly carries it off. All that sugar does its part to ruin the teeth also. It helps the\nbacteria to jump in and start still more trouble. Drop a tooth into a glass of Coke; then time the number\nof hours before the tooth totally disappears.",

Do not eat white sugar products.\n- Rinse out your mouth after eating or finish a fruit meal by eating an apple.\n- Goldenseal extract, that is alcohol-free, can be used as a antibacterial mouthwash.\n- To reduce infection in a tooth, put a few drops of goldenseal extract on a piece of cotton\nand apply it to the swollen area at night. For 3 consecutive nights, do this.\n- Eat plenty of raw fruits and vegetables.\n- Do not chew up vitamin C tablets! The acid in them will melt your teeth.\n- Avoid all toothpastes and powders. Detergents in them are harmful to teeth and gums.\n- It is vital that you take calcium supplement, in order to maintain good tooth and bone\nstructure. As you get older, you need even more calcium.\n- Massage gums with your finger once a day.\nTO STOP A TOOTHACHE—Until you can see a dentist, here are several suggestions:\n- Swish warm salt water in your mouth, and spit it out. Do this after every meal and before\nretiring at night. Stir 1 tsp. of salt into a glassful of water, at body temperature.\n- Somewhat warm salt water, held in the mouth will bring relief.\n- Apply 1-2 drops of oil of cloves to the affected tooth with a cotton swab. If the oil seems\ntoo strong, dilute it with olive oil.\n- Rinse your mouth vigorously with a mouthful of lukewarm water. If the pain is from\nfood caught between the teeth, this may flush it out.\n- Try flossing gently between the teeth.\n- Put a charcoal tablet in your mouth and, with your tongue or cheek, press it against the\nswollen gum at the base of the problem tooth.\n- Drink 1-2 cups of mullein tea or chew catnip herb.\n- Mash up the root of plantain and put it on the cheek near the tooth.\n- With your fingers rub an ice cube until one side is shaped into a V-shape. Then press it\ngently against the tender place, and push it back and forth over the area for 5-7 minutes.\nThe effect of rubbing tends to cancel out the pain signal, which must travel along the same\nnerve route.\n- Keep heat away from the tooth and nearby cheek. If it is an infection, the heat will draw\nthe infection to the outside of the jaw and make the situation worse.\n- Put ice on the nearby cheek for 15 minutes, 3-4 times a day.\n- Avoid biting on that area of the teeth.\n- Some individuals have found that, when a toothache begins, they quickly skip a meal,\nrest, take vitamin C, and conduct themselves very carefully over the next several\ndays—and the infection in the tooth is overcome by the body.\nDENTAL FILLINGS—Many books have been written on this subject in recent years. When you go to\nthe dentist, he drills out the decayed part, and then fills the cavity with something hard which, hopefully,\nwill last awhile.\nThe most common substance used for this filling is amalgam. This is a mixture of several metals, of\nwhich about 50% is always an extremely toxic chemical, called mercury. Mercury tends to evaporate\nslowly over a period of time. This influx of mercury, swallowed with your food day after day, is not the\nbest for your health.\nAlternatives are ceramic-based materials, gold, or platinum-type metals. They are more expensive, but\nless harmful. They do not gradually melt away, as does mercury in amalgam.\nFLUORIDE TREATMENTS—Even more books have been written about fluoride! This deadly poison\nshould be avoided at all costs. If it is added to your public drinking water supply, then you should buy\nbottled water (or buy a home distiller, to process your faucet water). If your dentist offers to give you\nfluoride treatments, you would do well to politely decline the opportunity.\nAIR ABRASION TECHNOLOGY—Air abrasion dental work is the latest hi-tech method of drilling\nteeth. It is said to painlessly remove tooth decay without drilling; it permits dentists to make smaller\nfillings and save a large percentage of the tooth. In addition, it does not require pain-killing anesthetics.\nENCOURAGEMENT—In the Bible, the will of God is revealed. He who makes these truths a part of\nhis life becomes, in every sense, a new creature. God can do for you what you never could do for\nyourself. But it requires total submission and obedience to His Written Word.\nGINGIVITIS (Receding Gums, Bleeding Gums)\nSYMPTOMS—The gums swell and get red. Cleaning the teeth makes them bleed.\nCAUSES—The gums pull away from the teeth. This is an early sign of periodontal disease (which see).",

If your teeth are having trouble, the other bones in\nyour body, although hidden, probably are also. You do not want a fractured hip later.\n- Eat a nourishing diet. Include raw fruit and vegetables. They help exercise your teeth and\ngums. They also help clean your teeth.\n- Stop using nicotine and alcohol. They remove vitamins and minerals from your body.\n- Fill an ear syringe (a rubber bulb with a long nose) with water and hose out your mouth.\nMassage the gums at least once a day; better yet, massage after every meal when you\nbrush your teeth.\n- Massage the gumline with a little baking soda on your finger, dipped in water.\n- Brush the teeth carefully after each meal. Use a soft toothbrush and do it gently.\nOtherwise you will make scratches on the enamel.\nAlternate between two toothbrushes, so each one can dry out before it is used again.\n- Soak the toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide once a week. This kills bacteria buildup.\n- Brush carefully at the gumline.\n- An electric toothbrush is said to eliminate 98% of the plaque; whereas a regular\ntoothbrush is said to remove only 48%.\n- Floss your teeth faithfully as needed.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Thousands have drawn from the well of life, yet there is no diminishing\nsupply. In the Bible will be found the help you need, day by day.\nPYORRHEA (Periodontal Disease, Gum Disease)\nSYMPTOMS—The gums become inflamed, extend to the ligaments and bones that hold the teeth in\nplace, and eventually the teeth loosen and fall out.\nCAUSES—Periodontal means \"located around a tooth,\" and refers to any problems in the gums or other\nsupporting structures of the teeth. It is also called pyorrhea, or gum disease. Gingivitis (which see) is\ninflammation of the gums, an early stage of periodontal disease.\nThe explanation given by many medical-dental professionals for periodontal disease is that plaque\n(sticky deposits of mucous, food particles, and bacteria) adheres to the teeth and gradually accumulates.\nThis plaque causes the gums to become infected and swollen. That infection (called gingivitis), leads to\npyorrhea (also called periodontitis) in which the bone underlying the teeth is eroded away by the\ninfection.\nThe other explanation is that much of what is known as pyorrhea is primarily caused by an inadequate\nintake of calcium, copper, vitamins D and C; by the eating of processed, and junk, food; and by erosion\nof acids, placed in the mouth. Smoking, stress, and wrong diet are other crucial factors.",

      "overview": "- It is known that inadequate nutrition, wrong foods, consumption of sugar, high\nphosphorous foods, smoking, drugs, excessive alcohol, chronic illness, and hormonal\ndisorders make an individual more susceptible to periodontal disease. Smokers have twice\nthe risk of gum disease. Laboratory animals given high sugar diets revealed a decrease in\nbone volume. These problems should, if possible, be corrected.\n- Calcium, copper, and vitamins D and C are needed for good strong teeth. Folic acid,\nniacin, bioflavonoids are also needed. As a rule, take care of the teeth, and the gums will\ntake care of themselves. Nourish the teeth with calcium and vitamin D.\n- Emotional stress is known to decrease the body's ability to resist gum disease. Exercise\nneutralizes stress and encourages healthy gums.\n- Open a capsule of vitamin E and rub the oil on inflamed gums, to aid in healing.\n- A powerful aid in stopping gum infection is to brush the teeth twice a day with powdered\ncharcoal.\n- If gum inflammation is present, run very hot water over the toothbrush, to soften it up\nbefore using it.\n- Put goldenseal powder in the mouth to help eliminate the infection. But do not take\ngoldenseal internally for more than a week at a time. (Too much can harm lactobacillus in\nthe bowel.) Do not use it during pregnancy.\n- Diabetes and certain blood disorders put a person at greater risk of developing\nperiodontal disease.\n- Warm chamomile tea may be used as a soothing mouthwash after each brushing. Do not\nadd sugar or milk to the tea.\nNote: Sores under the tongue can be an early sign of mouth cancer. But if you do not smoke or chew\ntobacco, you are unlikely to ever have that problem.\n—Also see \"Gingivitis\" for the other half of this periodontal problem.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord is soon coming. Talk it, pray it, sing it. Tell others to get their lives\nready to meet their Lord. But it is now, before probation closes, that we must, by faith in Christ, put sin\naway from our lives.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Loose-fitting dentures; dentures which may hurt the gums when chewing; dentures\nwhich cause difficulty in speaking properly.\nCAUSES—Dentures are false teeth. The professional explanation for the problem is that the wearers do\nnot take proper care of them, and that the gums periodically change shape, etc.\nThere is another, less-known, reason: When the decision is made to extract teeth and fit an individual for\ndentures, the teeth are pulled out and the molds prepared for the false teeth. The entire process is done as\nquickly as possible, so teeth will appear to be in the mouth again as soon as possible. In addition, it is a\nconvenience to the dentist to take the molds the same day that the extractions were done.\nBut when the extractions are made, the gums understandably swell! A number of sizeable wounds have\nbeen made in the mouth, and the gums are swollen and inflamed. That is not the time to take the molds.\nInstead, the person should wait at least one week for the gums to heal and readjust into their normal postdental sizes and shapes. Then those molds should be made.\nIf your dentist tells you that you need all your teeth pulled out, discuss the matter with him and perhaps\ncheck with another dentist or two. Very often only certain teeth need be removed and a bridge can be\ninstalled, which locks onto the teeth which remain. This is far better than wearing dentures. Do all you\ncan to keep your teeth.",

Do not let the dentist take molds too soon.\n- When you can, take out the dentures so the gums can rest.\n- Begin by eating soft foods, and gradually get used to chewing with dentures.\n- After each meal, scrub the dentures with soap and lukewarm water. Wash your gums\ngently with a soft toothbrush, to remove the plaque.\n- Massage your gums every day. Place your index finger over the outside of the gums,\nanother finger over the inside portion, and rub back and forth.\n- Rinse your mouth each day with warm water mixed with a tsp. of salt.\nENCOURAGEMENT—When the servants of Christ take the shield of faith for their defense, and the\nsword of the Spirit for war, there is danger in the enemy's camp.

Dehydration often causes bad breath, especially first thing in the\nmorning. Saliva does not flow during sleep, so no mouth cleaning occurs at night.\n- Eat parsley. Other chlorophyll-containing foods are also good for your breath.\n- Take charcoal by mouth. Let them dissolve slowly in the mouth.\n- Go on a five-day raw food diet, during which 50% of what you eat is raw. This will help\nclean out your system.\n- Apples, carrots, celery, etc., are excellent for cleaning out your mouth at the close of a\nmeal. They remove odor-causing bacteria from the mouth.\n- Outdoor exercise will bring more oxygen into the lungs and help clean out the system,\nreducing bad breath.\n- In the lives of many, gum disease is a major cause of bad breath. (See \"Gingivitis and\nPeriodontal Disease.\") Place goldenseal over the infected gums or mouth sores. Do this\nfor 3 days, to help heal the gums.\n- Far less likely, mouth breathing may cause bad breath. Yet, for many, the advantages of\nmouth breathing (obtaining more oxygen than otherwise could be done) outweighs the\npossible disadvantages.\n- Sinus infection produces a discharge with a bad odor. If you have sinus trouble, this may\nbe the cause of your bad breath.\n- Do not eat spicy foods.\n- Meat eating can produce bad breath, both because of the particles left in the mouth and\nbecause of later indigestion.\n- Cheese and fish both cause bad breath.\n- Yes, there is garlic, but it is such a powerful germ killer that you may need to take it\nanyway.\n- Drinking coffee, beer, wine, or whiskey are excellent ways to have bad breath. Water is\nthe best liquid for your body.\n- Use myrrh, rosemary, or peppermint to brush your teeth and rinse your mouth.\n- Avoid foods that get stuck between the teeth too easily.\n- Avoid foods that are too likely to cause tooth decay, such as meat, candies, and sticky\nsweets.\n- Instances have been reported of food allergies having caused bad breath. Search out the\nfoods you are allergic to, and avoid them. (See Allergies.)\n- Avoid constipation.\n- In cases of bad breath caused by stomach problems, thyme tea can be helpful.\n- Boil your toothbrush each month or buy a new one. Bacteria grow on the toothbrush.\nRinse it with hydrogen peroxide occasionally during the month.\n- Chew fennel or anise seeds after eating an odorous meal.\n- Do not use commercial mouthwashes. They irritate the mouth more than they solve any\nproblems. All they have is alcohol, dye, and flavoring.\nBad breath may be a sign of an underlying health problem.\n—See \"Gingivitis and Periodontal Disease.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Give the Word of God, the Bible, the honored place as the guide in your\nhome, and you and your family will be blessed for it.

After 430 million hiccups, he passed away.\nAlmost all hiccups are one-sided; that is, only one side of the diaphragm contracts. Overeating or\nexcessive drinking is the most common cause. It causes the stomach to extend downward and press\nagainst the diaphragm—which then starts its hiccuppy motions.\nA hiccup is a repeated involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, immediately followed by a\nsudden closure of the glottis.\nBut that information does not help solve the problem. Here is advice that may. All of these methods\nreally work for some people. See what is best for you.

Blow in and out exactly 10 times, and do it very hard until you\nare red in the face. You must do it fast, and you must form a good seal around the bag so\nno air gets in.\nHold your breath as long as you can, and then swallow when you think a hiccup is\ncoming. Do that 2-3 times. Then take a deep breath and begin again.\n- Hold your breath in for as long as possible, then exhale and hold that as long as possible.\n- Blow air out in a slow, steady stream.\n- Hold your breath, while extending your head as far backward as you can.\n- Swallow a teaspoonful of sugar, dry. It often stops the hiccups in minutes. The sugar in\nthe mouth probably sends different signals along the nerve routes, interfering with the\nhiccups.\n- Close your mouth, hold your nose and ears closed with your fingers and thumbs, and\nswallow 3 times before you let go. This creates a slight vacuum and changes the rhythm of\nthe diaphragm enough to bring relief.\n- Chew and swallow ice for 10-15 minutes.\n- Stand behind the person as he sits on a chair. Grasp the neck gently with your fingers\nand, with the thumbs, slowly massage down each side of the spinous process.\n- Fill a glass of water, bend over forward, and drink the water upside down.\n- Apply pressure with the flat of the hand, just below the breastbone.\n- Take a deep breath and drink 10 swallows of water while not breathing.\n- Put ice on the neck.\n- Drink catnip tea.\n- Place light fingertip pressure on each side of the neck, for about a minute.\n- When you are eating, just be quiet and eat, and you are not likely to get hiccups.\n- Take exactly 10 sips of water in rapid succession.\n- A sneeze sometimes stops the hiccups.\n- Have someone pull on your tongue.\n- Lie on the left side for 10-15 minutes.\n- Stand on your head.\n- Swallow crushed ice.\n- Deep breathing.\n- Have someone massage your feet.\n- Drink a half glassful of fresh orange juice.\n- Take a hot bath for 15 minutes.\n- Place an ice bag to the pit of the stomach.\n- Bend at the waist, to touch the toes, and hold this position for about 60 seconds. This\nmethod is useful for both adults and children.\n- When children run around and play, sometimes one ends up with the hiccups. When that\nhappens, try tickling him while he holds his breath, and tell him to try real hard not to\nlaugh. He will forget about the hiccups.\n- In case you have hiccups which will not stop, go on a 3 day complete fast.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The work of conquering evil is to be done through faith.

Citrus fruits or tomato-based foods cause it in a\nfew people.\nOther contributing factors are hiatal hernia, allergies, stress, gallbladder problems, and enzyme\ndeficiencies.",

      "overview": "- Immediately drink a large glass of water. This will help wash the HCl back down and\ndilute it as well.\n- Drink some raw potato juice. Whiz up an unpeeled potato and drink it down.\n- Do not lie down. Remain upright, so gravity can help push the HCl down and keep it\ndown. Later, when you do lie down, elevate the bed at the head by 4 inches.\n- Avoid bending over; if you must lift something, bend at the knees. You do not want to\ncompress your stomach when you have heartburn.\n- Eating mints relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, so HCl can crowd up into the\nesophagus.\n- Do not drink anything caffeinated, for it will irritate the esophagus even more. Caffeine\nrelaxes the sphincter, so stomach contents can move on up. Tobacco smoke also relaxes\nthe sphincter. Estrogens relax it also.\n- Drinking milk may feel good going down, but it encourages the stomach to secrete more\nacid.\n- Drinks with fizz in them expand the stomach and make it more likely that HCl will come\nup the food pipe.\n- Greasy, fried, and fatty foods sit in the stomach for a long time and increase HCl\nproduction. Avoid meat and dairy products.\n- Antidepressants and sedatives aggravate heartburn. Aspirin and ibuprofen cause\nheartburn.\n- Antacids only mask the symptoms. They also contain aluminum.\n- Avoid stress, for that increases HCl production also.\n- Loosen your belt; better yet, wear suspenders.\n- Do not eat within 2½ hours before bedtime. Doing so not only can cause heartburn, but\nbring on heart attacks also.\n- Eat more raw vegetables, chew your food well, and eat slowly.\n- Angina and heart attack are both very dangerous conditions (which see). Among the\nearliest symptoms is, what appears to be, an \"acid stomach.\" Beware. You are wise to eat\nso that you do not have heartburn. Then if major heart trouble sends a warning message\nthat seems like heartburn, you will be less likely to sit back and take some aluminum,\nfrom the drugstore, for \"antacid.\" Aluminum is a cause of Alzheimer's disease (which\nsee).\nENCOURAGEMENT—Even on earth we may have joy as a wellspring, never failing, because it is fed\nby the streams that flow from the throne of God. All this is ours as we study the Bible, and, in Christ's\nstrength, obey it.\nHIATAL HERNIA (Hiatus Hernia)\nSYMPTOMS—Heartburn and belching. There may be difficulty in swallowing. Material from the\nstomach may suddenly return into the throat or mouth, causing a burning sensation. It may feel as if\nthere is a lump in the throat, or that food is sticking at a point in the throat. Sometimes bloody mucous is\ncoughed up.\nCAUSES—The stomach pushes, or herniates, upward through an opening in the diaphragm into the\nchest cavity (the thorax). A weakness in the diaphragm as it leaves the esophagus may enlarge the\nopening, where the esophagus (food pipe) enters the stomach. This enables the stomach to slide up\nsomewhat.\nThe weakness is often caused by increased pressure upward, from what is in or near the abdominal\ncavity: obesity, pregnancy, tumors, heavy lifting, overeating, straining at the stool, or tight clothing.\nIt is said that nearly half the people over 40, in the U.S., have hiatal hernias. But most are unaware of it,\nsince these hernias are often quite small and are hardly noticed. They occur in women four times as\noften as in men, perhaps due to tight clothing. They generally first occur after the age of 40.\nThe acid material that comes up into the windpipe, from the larger hernias, frequently causes ulceration\nin the esophageal wall.\nBut ulcers can also occur in the duodenum, which is the top part of the small intestine, just below the\nstomach.\nPeople with this condition have a tendency to have overacid stomachs.\nBetween the esophagus and stomach is the esophageal sphincter. This is a circular valve which can open\nand close. But its strength is damaged by drugs, tobacco (smoked or chewed), or certain foods. This\nweakening allows food and acid to go back up into the windpipe.\nThose certain foods include coffee and chocolate (because of the methylxanthines in them), spicy foods,\ntomato, alcohol, peppermint, spearmint, and citrus juices. Tobacco and coffee are especially bad. Whole\nmilk can also be a problem. Weakening of the sphincter occurs within 30 minutes after drinking coffee.\nOne puff of a cigarette can lower sphincter pressure to zero; the result is called \"smoker's heartburn.\"",

      "overview": "- As soon as you sense heartburn coming on, drink 1-2 large glasses of water. This tends\nto wash the acid back down into the stomach.\n- Eat nourishing food, plus vitamin/mineral supplements. Several small meals are best.\nAvoid overeating; it only intensifies the problem. Supper, if eaten at all, should be light\nand 2-3 hours before bedtime. Food in the stomach, after you are in bed, is more likely to\nflow back up into the windpipe. Stop eating supper entirely, and you are more likely to\nhave success in overcoming hiatal hernia.\n- Include extra fiber; this helps soak up some of the acid.\n- Avoid fried food and fats; they slow down the digestion process in the stomach. Do not\ntake tea, coffee, colas, alcohol, or tobacco. Avoid refined foods, including white-flour\nproducts and sugar.\n- Avoid coffee, chocolate, spicy foods, alcohol, tomatoes, mint foods, whole milk, and\npossibly citrus juices.\n- Avoid constipation by including fiber in the diet.\n- Eat your meals on a regular schedule, and do not eat between meals. Eating between\nmeals causes the stomach to stop partway through, and start all over again—still with\neverything from the previous meal in it.\n- Even when not thirsty, drink a large glass of water every so often throughout the day.\n- Avoid heavy lifting, and do not bend over more than you have to. Wait till 2 hours after\na meal before starting heavy exertion.\n- Bend from the knees, not from the waist, to avoid upward pressure on the stomach.\n- Daily outdoor exercise will strengthen the muscles.\n- Avoid stress and stressful situations.\n- Avoid tight clothing (corsets, girdles, belts, etc.)\n- You may need to raise the head of the bed 4-8 inches to avoid reflux of food upward at\nnight.\n—Also see \"Hernia\" and \"Umbilical Hernia.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—We all need a guide through the many difficult places of life. But if we will\ncling to God and His Written Word, the Bible, we can have the victory at each step.\nVOMITING (Emesis)\nSYMPTOMS—The person vomits.\nCAUSES—The cause is often overeating, eating the wrong food, poor combinations, or excessive\nalcohol consumption. But it can also be caused by food allergies, poisoning, food poisoning, or infection\n(flu, Epstein-Barr syndrome, candida, etc.) If the vomitus (that which comes up) looks like \"coffee\ngrounds,\" it includes large amounts of blood from a bleeding ulcer or stomach cancer. This is an\nemergency, for extensive internal bleeding can result in death. Take him to the emergency room.\nIf it occurs in infants, accompanied by fever and the child is unresponsive, it could indicate meningitis.\nCall a physician immediately. (See meningitis.)\nBut it might be that you need to induce vomiting, after someone eats a poisonous plant, rat poison, etc.\nTO ASSIST VOMITING TO OCCUR—If you have eaten something poisonous or are having a\ngallbladder attack, an emetic will help. Drink an emetic herb tea. Lobelia is probably the best. Make an\nherb tea of lobelia or peach leaves, and take a teaspoonful every 15 minutes for 3-4 hours.\nEMETIC HERBS—When giving lobelia tea, give the full dose all at once or you will not induce\nvomiting. Add 1 oz lobelia to a quart of boiling water; let it steep for 5-10 minutes if you are in a hurry\n(15-20 minutes is better). Then give a cup or two of the liquid (not hot), and let him vomit.\nOther emetic herbs include bayberry bark, myrica, white willow, and ragwort.\nIn his book, Back to Eden (see order sheet), p. 260, Kloss gives a complicated formula for giving herbs\nto help a person vomit. You might wish to refer to it.\nTO STOP VOMITING—Give very small doses of lobelia; it will relax the person and the vomiting\nwill cease. Use a teaspoon of boiling water, steep, take a teaspoonful of this every 15 minutes, until\nrelief is obtained. A cup of hot peppermint or spearmint tea, taken after the stomach has been cleaned\nout, will also help settle it. Catnip or sweet balm are also useful. A hot fomentation over the stomach, or\na hot water bottle with a moist towel under it, will help settle the stomach.\nAFTER VOMITING—Do not eat for several hours, but carefully take fluids, as you are able.\nYou lose a lot of fluid when you vomit. Be sure and replace it. Drink water, do not become dehydrated.\nThose fluids should be clear: water, weak tea, or fruit juices. Milk and heavy soups may be too much for\nthe stomach just then.\nDrink small amounts of peppermint tea.\nVomiting also flushes out minerals. These need to be replaced with electrolyte drinks, clear soups, or\napple or cranberry juice. If only water, add a couple pinches of sugar and salt to it. After vomiting, it is\nbest to sip the fluids, then pause, then sip a little more; do not gulp them down. Do not drink cold fluids;\nit is a shock to the weakened stomach. Do not drink carbonated products at this time.\nWhen you are ready to eat, start back with a small carbohydrate meal, such as rice soup. Avoid fatty\nsubstances, for they would remain in the tired stomach too long.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God bids us to fill the mind with great thoughts, pure thoughts. He desires us\nto think upon His love and mercy to us; study, in the Bible, the plan He has to save us through faith in\nJesus Christ.\nINDIGESTION (Dyspepsia)\nSYMPTOMS—Gas, abdominal pain, a bloated feeling, belching, nausea, rumbling noises. Sometimes\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—Dyspepsia is probably the most common \"disease\" in the Western world. Ongoing\nindigestion can lead to food allergies, osteoporosis, anemia, degenerative disease, and a debilitated\nimmune system.\nDietary habits and stress are primary causes of this problem. Other causes include (1) overeating, eating\ntoo fast, not chewing food well, eating when fatigued; (2) too much cooked food and not enough fresh\nfood, not enough fiber in the diet; (3) partaking of coffee, tea, soft drinks, alcohol, and using nicotine;\n(4) eating foods you are allergic to (see \"Pulse Test\"); (5) eating when nervous, distressed, angry,\nfearful, etc.; (6) and a lack of hydrochloric acid.",

Every provision has been made for us to receive divine power, which will enable us to\novercome temptations. Through obedience, through Christ's enabling grace, to all God's requirements,\nthe soul is preserved unto eternal life.\nDYSPEPSIA (Poor Digestion; Indigestion)\nSYMPTOMS—Gas, a bloated feeling, rumbling noises, belching, possibly a burning feeling, and\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—The main causes are dietary habits and stress. Lack of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and enzymes\nare other major causes. Lack of enzymes keep vitamins and minerals from being used properly.\nInadequate HCl means the protein food will not be digested correctly.\nOther contributing factors include peptic ulcers. Intestinal obstruction can also lead to indigestion. If the\nliver, pancreas, or gallbladder are not function properly, it is more difficult for the body to digest food.\nA key factor can be hydrochloric acid production (see Achlorhydria).\nIf food does not digest properly, it tends to ferment in the intestines. This produces hydrogen and carbondioxide gas, which causes bloating and pain. (See Bloating.)",

      "overview": "- Do not eat when you are in a hurry or under stress. You should be able to relax when you\neat. Do not eat when you are upset or excessively tired. Do not drink liquids with your\nmeal, for this dilutes your stomach juices. Take time to chew your food thoroughly.\n- Eat more live (raw) foods rather than primarily heavily cooked items. Fresh, raw foods\nare rich in enzymes that help digest and assimilate the nutrients. But those enzymes are\ndestroyed when heated to more than 120o F. All processed foods have been heated above\n120o F.\n- Cut down on the meat or eliminate it entirely. It is very hard to digest, and frequently\ncarries bacteria and parasites.\n- Be sure and include enough fiber in your meal. Otherwise you are more likely to have\nconstipation, with consequent absorption of toxins back into the system.\n- Include trace minerals in the diet (in Norway kelp and Nova Scotia dulse), and obtain\nadequate vitamin and mineral supplementation. If you are having a difficult time\nabsorbing your food, you need to maintain good supplementation all the more.\nSwallowing air (by chewing with the mouth open or talking while chewing) can cause\nindigestion.\n- First thing in the morning, juice a lemon and and drink it in a cup of water. This will\nhelp prepare your stomach for its daily duties.\n- Ginger is good, to lessen digestive nausea.\n- Catnip, chamomile, fennel, and peppermint are all helpful in reducing indigestion. Mint\ntea calms the stomach.\n- Papain, papaya (containing the digestive enzyme papain), and fresh pineapple\n(containing another digestive enzyme, bromelin) are also very helpful.\n- Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D are needed.\n- English bitters are very helpful. Take them before each meal.\n- Helpful herbs include balm, bitter orange, celandine, hops, fennel, and yarrow.\n- Alcohol; vinegar; caffeine; and spicy, refined, or greasy foods promotes indigestion.\n- Food allergies, such as lactose intolerance, can cause it also, so locate them. (See\nAllergies.) Avoid foods which tend to bother you. Take the pulse test in order to determine\nyours. (See Pulse Test.)\n- Do not eat too heavily of legumes, especially lentils, peanuts, and soybeans. They\ncontain a substance which slows down certain digestive enzymes.\n- Avoid these food combinations: milk and sugar, fruits and vegetables, sugar and protein.\n- Take an out-of-door walk after breakfast. If you can, do it where the air is fresh, not by a\nhighway.\n- Keep in mind Kouchadoff's discovery. This Russian scientist experimented with cooked\nfood and found that, when it was eaten, the white blood cells increased rapidly in the\nsmall intestine. As part of our immune system, they increase to fight hostile invaders. In\nother words, when your white blood cell count goes up, a threatened infection or disease is\nbeing prepared for.\n- Eating raw foods protects the immune system, and does not cause an increase in white\nblood cell count.\n- Dr. Bircher-Benner, of Switzerland, discovered that eating raw food at a meal before\ncooked food prevented the formation of white cells in the intestines. Therefore, he always\nserved raw salads before cooked foods.\n—Now, for the other side of the coin:\n- There is a theory which some accept and others reject. Consider this:\n- A major cause of indigestion is eating salads and other light food at the beginning of the\nmeal, and waiting till partway through the meal to eat the protein foods. But protein foods\nneed lots of HCl for proper digestion; the other foods do not. So begin your meal with\nyour protein foods. You can eat salads with your protein food, but not before it.\n- Which theory is correct? The truth may be in the middle: Those who have an abundance\nof HCl tend to do better eating some protein at the beginning of the meal, and those who\ndo not have as much do better eating the raw foods, to begin with.\n—Also see \"Nervous Dyspepsia,\" \"Bloating,\" \"Achlorhydria,\" \"Allergies,\" and \"Pulse Test.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God purposes are right, but will prove of no avail unless resolutely carried out.\nMany will be lost while hoping and desiring to be Christians; but they made no earnest effort to accept\nChrist and, in His strength, obey His will as given in the Bible.\nNERVOUS DYSPEPSIA (J.H.

Antibiotics are a frequent cause, and weaken the body so the virus can attack.\nThis disease is contagious, so be careful. Wash hands frequently, sterilize cloths, etc.",

      "overview": "- Begin by giving the person activated charcoal: Each dose should be 4 capsules, 8 tablets,\nor 1-2 tbsp. of powder, stirred into a glass of water. Give a dose each time there is\nvomiting or diarrheal stools.\n- Keep him in bed and give a clear liquid diet during the acute stage while there is nausea\nand vomiting. Throughout the day give small amounts of water, fruit juices, or ice chips,\nto help restore lost fluid.\n- Do not give junk beverages (colas, black tea, coffee, or alcohol), for they will only\nirritate and intensify the symptoms.\n- When vomiting and diarrhea cease, give small amounts of non-irritating food, such as\ncooked rice, plain cooked potatoes, cooked carrots, bananas, or apple sauce.\n- Avoid processed and greasy foods; avoid milk and high-roughage foods.\n- Do not be quick to let him up from bed, for the vomiting and loss of fluids may have\nweakened him.\n- Especially in small children and infants, watch for signs of dehydration. These signs\ninclude drowsiness, rapid respiration, and dry skin and mucous membranes. This is\nimportant.\n- Mix 1 tsp. of catnip tea leaves in a cup of water, steep for 15 minutes, and drink while\nwarm. This is very soothing to the digestive system. If it is vomited up, give again\nimmediately; it is more likely to be accepted and kept down the second time.\n- If fluids cannot be kept down, then give small saline enemas, to replace lost body fluids.\nUsing 1 level tsp. of salt per pint of water, inject 1-2 oz of the solution into the rectum\n(using a small rubber bulb syringe). Then hold the buttocks together for several minutes.\nDo this every 1-2 hours until improvement is seen, and he is able to take fluids by mouth.\n—Also see \"Chronic Gastritis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God has a heaven full of blessings that He wants to bestow on those who are\nearnestly seeking for that help which the Lord alone can give.\nCHRONIC GASTRITIS (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nAVOID CAUSES—such as mustard; pepper; vinegar, strong acids; even acid fruits; sugar; preserves;\ncheese; alcoholic beverages; tea and coffee; all indigestible and irritating substances; coarse vegetables;\npickles; confectionery; and hasty eating.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL REST—Avoid the use of fish, fowl, game, and all flesh foods which excite the\nsecretion of HCl (hydrochloric acid) and remain long in the stomach. Coarse vegetables; fried foods;\nfats, except in a natural emulsified condition; large meals; tea; coffee; wines; and all liquors are to be\navoided.\nINCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE—Graduated Cold Baths, twice daily.\nCOMBAT LOCAL CONGESTION—Fomentation over stomach area, 3 times daily, 15 minutes at a\ntime. During intervals between, apply Heating Compress over it. Hot Leg Pack, followed by Heating\nCompress to the legs; Revulsive Douche to the legs; Hot Leg Bath, followed by Cold Friction to legs. In\nacute stages, withhold all food and rest in bed.\nMUCOUS VOMITING IN THE MORNING—Omit the evening meal. Fomentation over stomach in\nevening, followed by Heating Compress, to be worn during the night.\nVOMITING SOON AFTER EATING—Hot and Cold Compress over stomach or apply a Hot Trunk\nPack half an hour before eating, to be retained for 2 hours; dry food in small quantities; rest in bed after\neating; Ice Bag to spine after eating.\nGASEOUS ERUCTATIONS—Dry diet of well-cooked grains; Cold Compress; Heating Compress\nover stomach at 600 F., changing every 4 hours. Massage for half an hour, 2 hours after eating, if local\nirritation or tenderness does not contraindicate. Drink a pint of hot water half an hour before eating.\nAvoid use of vegetables or of vegetables and fruits at same meal.\nABDOMINAL TYMPANITES—Heating Compress to Abdomen at 600 F., changed every 4 hours;\nColonic 2-3 times a week, at 700 F.\nCONSTIPATION—Graduated Cold Enema at 700 F., daily. Abdominal massage; Hot Abdominal\nPack; Cold fan Douche to abdomen for 20 seconds; Cold Rubbing Sitz Bath.\nLIVER CONGESTION—Fomentation over liver, twice daily; during the interval between, apply a\ncontinuous Heating Compress.\nEMACIATION—Rest in bed; mild Tonic Frictions, carefully graduated. Ice Bag over stomach, half an\nhour before eating.\nPAIN IN STOMACH—Revulsive Compress over stomach and intestines; repeat several times daily if\nnecessary. Avoid acid fruits, very hot foods, very cold foods, and concentrated sweets, if they cause\npain.\n—Also see \"Gastroenteritis.\"\nPEPTIC ULCER—1 (Gastric Ulcer, Stomach Ulcer; Duodenal Ulcer)\nSYMPTOMS—Chronic burning or gnawing stomach pain, which often begins 45-60 minutes after\nfinishing a meal or at night. Drinking a large glass of water or eating food relieves it. Vomiting or\nswallowing something quite alkaline also does. The pain sometimes awakens the person at 1 or 2 a.m.\nPain just beneath the breastbone is a frequent symptom of an ulcer. Sometimes it radiates to the back.\nThe pain is often considered to be heartburn or an empty stomach.\nOther symptoms may include headaches, a choking sensation, lower back pain, itching, and possible\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers occurring in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers\noccurring in the top part of the small intestine. However causes and treatment are essentially the same.\nThese ulcers can be caused by wrong food or too much food. They can also be induced by severe\nnervous and mental stress.\nThe walls of the stomach pour a powerful acid into the stomach (hydrochloric acid, or HCl). This\npowerful fluid is needed to digest protein. Although the walls of the stomach are protein, they are not\nnormally disturbed by the fluid. But when there are problems with people or with the food—then trouble\ncan begin.\nThe stomach acids begin digesting the walls of the stomach, because too much HCl is being produced;\nprotective mucous, in order to protect the walls, is not being produced; or both.\nThese ulcers can occur in the esophagus, but generally occur in the stomach or small intestine.\nGastric ulcers (peptic ulcers in the stomach) occur 2½ times more often in men than in women, most\nfrequently in the 40-55 age group.\nDuodenal ulcers (peptic ulcers in the small intestine) occur in the first 11 inches of the small intestine,\nand are caused by excess HCl from the stomach. These ulcers are found in men 4 times as often as in\nwomen, and most frequently between 25 and 40 years of age. Duodenal ulcers occur 10 times more\noften than gastric ulcers. As much as 15% of the U.S. population have ulcers, but only about half are\ndiagnosed. Some are not discovered until the person begins vomiting blood. Ulcers especially occur\nduring the spring and fall, and tend to run in families.\nMany factors affect stomach-acid secretion. Stress and anxiety increase it. Aspirin, steroids, antiinflammatory drugs, and smoking—all increase HCl production.\nWhen you have stomach pain, drink some lemon juice. If the pain gets worse, you have too much acid in\nyour stomach.\nHypoglycemics tend to produce too much HCl and are in danger of eventually having a peptic ulcer.\nIf you vomit blood or have \"coffee-ground\" stools, then the ulcer is bleeding. You are in danger of\nbleeding to death—go to a hospital immediately.",

      "overview": "- For rapid pain relief, drink a large glass of water. It dilutes the stomach acids and flushes\nthem out.\n- Avoid all situations resulting in tension, stress, irritability, nervous strain, anger, or fear.\nComplete rest and relaxation from pressing problems and worries is needed.\n- Do not eat fried foods, tea, caffeine products, salt, chocolate, animal fats, strong spices\nor soft drinks. Do not drink cow's milk. Do not smoke (if you do, do not expect the ulcer\nto heal properly).\n- A diet high in sugar increases HCl production. White bread also causes more HCl to be\nmade.\n- In earlier years the recommended treatment included frequent feedings, milk intake, and\na bland diet. But this approach is being discarded.\n- It is now known that the calcium in milk only stimulates acid production rather than\ndecreasing it, as was taught for years. (Milk does initially neutralize HCl, but the calcium\ntriggers gastrin, which causes the walls to excrete more HCl.)\n- In addition, it is now known that sipping milk and cream can lead to myocardial infarcts\n(heart attacks). The problem seems to be the butter fat in the sippy diet.\n- The bland diet approach is also being discarded because those foods neither relieve pain\nnor speed healing. So, instead, eat whatever good food works best for you.\n- Potatoes are very helpful. They are soothing and have an alkaline reaction.\n- Vitamin U is the anti-ulcer vitamin. It is specifically for peptic ulcers. Raw cabbage juice\nand alfalfa have the most. Boiling destroys this anti-ulcer factor, and wilted cabbage\ncontains less vitamin U. Drink fresh, raw cabbage juice immediately after juicing.\n- Eat plenty of dark green leafy vegetables. If symptoms are severe, eat soft foods\n(potatoes, squash, bananas, yams, etc.) Put other vegetables through a blender.\n- If you have a bleeding ulcer, add some psyllium seed to the food.\n- Well-cooked white rice and millet are good.\n- Eat several small meals.\n- Do not eat between meals. Doing so slows emptying of the stomach, and thereby\nincreases HCl amounts in the stomach.\n- Chew food slowly and properly.\n- Also helpful are flax, German chamomile, licorice, catnip, bayberry, goldenseal, hops,\nvalerian, and myrrh.\n- Exercise neutralizes stress. Maintain a daily program of out-of-door exercise.\n- Make sure the bowels move daily or take cleansing enemas.\n- Do not take antacids or painkillers, such as aspirin. That only increases the problem. The\ncalcium carbonate in the antacids doubles the amount of HCl production. The aspirin\ncauses the stomach to bleed!\n- Do not use medicinal drugs.\n- For peptic ulcer pain, apply an ice bag to the abdomen just above the navel. Or place it\non the spine between the shoulder blades.\n—Also see \"Peptic Ulcer—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God fixes no limit to the advancement His children can make, if they will but\nsurrender their lives to His guidance, study, and obey His Inspired Writings.\nPEPTIC ULCER—2 (J.H.

The pain may spread to the back and is made worse by\nmoving. Food, alcohol, and vomiting may worsen the pain.\nChronic cases: The pain is milder and pain attacks do not come on suddenly. There is excessive gas,\nmuscle aches, and fever. Permanent damage to the pancreas can occur, because the constant\ninflammation can produce fibrosis in that organ. The chronic state results in irreversible changes in the\ngallbladder.\nOther symptoms of pancreatitis include abdominal swelling and distension, hypertension, sweating, and\nabnormal fatty stools.\nDiabetes, digestive problems, and cancer can also result, as well as hearing, respiratory, and kidney\nfailure.\nCAUSES—Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Normal cells are replaced with scar tissue and\ncalcium deposits. It frequently produces mild diabetes.\nThe most frequent causes of pancreatitis are drinking alcohol, viral infection, and diseases of the bile\nducts or gallbladder. A diet rich in fats and meat lays a solid foundation for pancreatitis to occur. Other\ncauses include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, and a considerable variety of prescribed\nmedications. Oral contraceptives, steroids, estrogen, and ACTH can also do it.\nTo this list should be added abdominal injury, obesity, poor nutrition, and electric shock.\nCertain diseases can also induce it: hepatitis, mumps, and possibly anorexia nervosa.\nThe pancreas produces two important hormones: insulin and glucagon; both of which regulate blood\nsugar levels and aid digestion.

      "overview": "- With only supportive care, the acute symptoms will fade. But some will continue to have\nchronic symptoms arising so often, for months or years. This is called chronic relapsing\npancreatitis.\n- It is wise to do everything possible to avoid the chronic condition or, if it is has begun,\ntry to clear it up as much as possible.\n- Fast and take only water until the acute symptoms subside. Food in the stomach triggers\nthe pancreas to start working, and this you do not want just now.\n- Give slippery elm enemas. Cut the slippery elm bark into very small pieces, and put a\nlarge handful in 4 quarts of water. Simmer for 1-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Then let it\nset, covered for 30 minutes. Strain and use it warm. Drink it and use in enemas.\n- Place a heaping teaspoonful of lobelia in a cup of boiling water and let it steep for a half\nhour; then add a tablespoon of this lobelia tea to each cup of slippery elm tea, and drink.\nAlso drink a cup a hour before each meal and before retiring. This will both relax and\ncleanse the digestive tract.\n- After coming off the fast because the acute phase is over, eat a low calorie, low fat diet.\nIn chronic pancreatitis, that organ often no longer produces lipase normally. Without it,\nfats cannot be properly handled by the body. So eat a low fat diet for the rest of your life.\n- Go on a low sugar diet. A heavy diet of refined carbohydrates can cause pancreatitis.\n- Say good-bye to all alcoholic beverages, and also to caffeine.\n- Avoid overeating. This also overworks the pancreas.\n- There are no medications which can solve this problem. Indeed, it was medications\nwhich may have led to it; continuing to take them may only intensify the disease.\n- Even though total pancreatactomy may be recommended, avoid surgery. It will probably\nonly worsen the condition.\n- In case of a very serious acute crisis, give frequent hot steam pack fomentations to the\nabdomen. Give charcoal internally, and apply it as a poultice over the affected area. Place\nthe person on a strict program of what he eats and drinks.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The sinner may become a child of God, an heir of heaven.

      "overview": "CARING FOR YOUR LIVER—There are few organs in your body as vital as the liver. It not only is\nthe largest organ, it also performs more different functions than any other organ in your body.\nOnly God could make the liver. That relatively small structure (it only weighs four pounds) does literally\nthousands of different things; all of them are quite complicated, involving complex chemical changes.\nThe liver is truly a special gift from God.\nThere are six fundamental things which tend to damage the liver:\n1 - Overeating. This is an excellent way to ruin your liver. Just eat all you want, and you\nwill wear it out.\n2 - Eating and drinking the wrong things. Here are some of those items which your liver\ndoes not wish to face: refined white flour-products, processed foods, junk foods, white\nsugar products, imitation foods. Beware of potato chips and corn chips.\nWhat is an imitation food? It is a food made to appear like the original, yet which has been\nstripped of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and most everything else that might be\nworthwhile while carbohydrates, sugar, fats, protein, synthetic colors, flavors, and odors\nare there to give the appearance and taste of real food.\n3 - A low protein, high carbohydrate and fat diet. To make it even worse, make sure it is\nfull of saturated or hydrogenated fats. All kinds of snacks in the stores consist of this.\nFried foods may be a devilish delight, but they only add to the eventual misery.\n4 - Take the specialty food poisons: alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, theobromine, and hard\ndrugs.\n5 - Take medicinal drugs. Select from over-the-counter items or those which are\nprescribed. They will provide you with a real witch's brew of physical horror, much of it\nnot known and realized until later. With hardly an exception, medicinal drugs are poisons.\nThe liver has to work overtime in order to try to excrete these dangerous chemicals.\nSome substances which are called \"drugs,\" such as charcoal, are not drugs. They are\nnatural substances which help your body. It is true there are some poisonous herbs, but\nthese will be readily found in the drugstore. The rest, found in the meadow and forest, are\nfor the healing of the nations.\n6 - Associate closely with insecticides, preservatives, and other cumulative poisons. Some\npoisons directly damage the liver (alcohol, oral contraceptives, caffeine, etc.); others\ndamage organs which the liver relies on for help (the pancreas, kidneys, etc.).\nHere are some dietary suggestions:\nDo not use nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, fish, fowl, meat, salt, soft drinks, sugar foods, tea,\nor fried foods.\nAvoid foods which tend to constipate. When there is a backup in the large colon, toxins\nare reabsorbed into the system, and the liver labors to eliminate them.\nMake sure you obtain foods high in potassium. This includes rice, bananas, blackstrap\nmolasses, wheat bran, almonds, seeds, kelp and dulse, brewer's yeast, prunes, and raisins.\nDrink lots of water; and, if at all possible, drink only pure water. Drink a little every hour.\nEmphasize raw foods in your diet.\nDrink fresh vegetable juices, especially carrot and beet.\nOnly eat raw nuts and seeds. They must be fresh and not stale!\nUse only cold-pressed vegetable oils,—and no other type of oils and no grease (margarine,\nbutter, shortening, or meat fat).\nVitamin K is important, to help prevent cirrhosis of the liver.\nDo not take too much vitamin A. For the same reason, do not eat fish more than twice a\nweek. Avoid cod liver oil. Better yet, stop eating fish. Meat eating is also harmful to the\nliver. Anyone taking over 50,000 IU of vitamin A for over a year should either reduce\nintake or switch to natural beta-carotene, which is safe.\nDo not drink milk or eat pastries, stimulants, white rice, black or white pepper, fried or\nfatty foods, cheese, and refined or processed foods.\nNever eat raw or undercooked fish, meat, or poultry. There is a serious risk of infection\nfrom doing this. Meat eating is a major source of bacteria parasites, viruses, and various\nmalignancies.\nWhen taking supplements, either chew them up well or take them with a glassful of water.\nUse celandine and silymarin (which is milk thistle extract) every day to help maintain\ngood liver function. But do not use celandine during pregnancy.\nThe lemon and the liver are sweethearts. The lemon is one of the best friends that the liver\nhas.\nCoenzyme Q10 helps supply oxygen to the liver.\nLecithin helps prevent fatty buildup in the liver.\nIn addition to taking care of your liver, treat your kidneys well also. Poor kidney function\nresults in damage to the liver. Drink water! (See \"Kidney problems.\")\nDo not use harsh laxatives. But do keep the colon clean.\nTake no drugs if you want your future years to be happy ones.\nBe good to your liver, and it will help you in years to come. It is a well-known fact,\namong natural healers, that, if the liver is all right, cancer can be eliminated. But if the\nliver is too far degenerated, the hoped-for solution may not be achieved.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The knowledge of God is as high as heaven, yet He can reveal to you all you\nneed, just for today, if you will but give your life daily into His hands.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Weakness, nausea, headache, vomiting, fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite,\ndrowsiness, dark urine, joint stiffness and pains, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, lightcolored stools, and often jaundice (a yellowing of the skin, which will first be noticed in the eyes and\nmucous membranes). Skin rashes and itching may also occur; the latter is caused by excess bile salts\nunder the skin.\nCAUSES—Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, and may be caused by a virus, bacterium, or toxic\nsubstance. But, in most instances, the cause is viral. There are actually several main types of hepatitis:\nHepatitis A (infectious hepatitis): Transmitted by contaminated water, milk, or food, it has an incubation\nperiod of 15-45 days. The contagion is highest just before illness begins, so food workers can transmit\nthe disease. Hepatitis A is contagious from 2 weeks to 1 week before the illness starts. It is easily spread\nby person-to-person contact and through contact with food, clothing, linens, etc. It can be transmitted\nfrom animals. Eating shellfish is a good way to get it, even if the waters they live in pass national\nstandards. Recovery generally occurs within 4 weeks. Chronic cases are less likely to occur.\nHepatitis B (serum hepatitis): Found throughout the world and spread as HIV is—through contact with\ninfected blood (contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusions) and sexual contact. Six cases have\nbeen traced to contaminated acupuncture needles. About 5% of all Americans and 85% of gay men have\nit. Hepatitis B is very serious. It has an incubation period of 28-160 days (2-6 months), and recovery\nmay require 6 months. All during that time, it can be passed from one person to another. In increasing\nnumbers, cases are reverting to chronic active hepatitis, which can result in liver cirrhosis and death.\nHepatitis B is the ninth major killer in the United States.\nHepatitis C: Contracted in the same manner as HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C may take 6 months to\nproduce symptoms, yet all that time it can be spread from one person to another. Between 20-40% of all\nhepatitis cases are of this type. It accounts for 90-95% of all hepatitis transmitted by blood donations.\nHepatitis E, hepatitis non-A, and hepatitis non-B also exist, but are of lesser significance in North\nAmerica. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is in epidemic proportions in Africa and Asia, and is\nbecoming a serious problem in Mexico. It is generally contracted from drinking sewage-contaminated\nwater. Such water should be boiled before using.\nAll of the above are primarily viral forms of hepatitis. But there is also one which is caused by toxic\nchemicals. It is called toxic hepatitis. The amount to which the liver was exposed to the poisonous\nchemicals, fumes, drug, etc., determines the amount of damage to that organ.\nOverall, there are 40,000-70,000 reported, new cases of hepatitis each year in America. But the experts\nsuspect that there are probably ten times that many which go unreported. It most often occurs in young\nadults, and is highest in teenage girls.\nHepatitis A is decreasing, and hepatitis B is rapidly increasing. It is fourth among the 30 leading\ncommunicable diseases.",

This is a yellow-brown substance which results from the breakdown of old red blood cells. The liver\nmust constantly remove bilirubin from the blood; and, if this is not done, bilirubin begins collecting in\ntissues all over the body, the urine is darker, and the stools are lighter because the bilirubin it usually\ncontains is not present.\nBut red blood cell destruction can also cause it. Blood tests identify whether the problem is obstruction\nor RBC destruction.\nJaundice is not itself a disease, but rather a symptom of one. It can point to pernicious anemia, hepatitis,\ncirrhosis of the liver, and hemolysis (which is an abnormal destruction of red blood cells). Jaundice can\nalso be caused by a blockage of the bile duct system in the liver, because of gallstones or a tumor. More\nrarely, it is caused by a parasitic infestation, such as tapeworm, hookworm, a flea, or mosquito carrying\na viral infection.",

    "type": "condition",
    "title": "# Liver Flush",
    "fields": {
      "overview": "WHAT IT IS—The liver filters the blood and excretes much of that waste through the bile, which it\nsends into the gallbladder. When some oil or fat is in a meal, its presence signals the gallbladder to\ncontract and squeeze out some bile, which helps prepare those oils and fats to be properly absorbed by\nthe body.\nA liver flush occurs when much of the bile is flushed out of the gallbladder. However, there is the\npossibility that gallstones may be in the bladder. So phase one of the liver flush is to melt down those\nstones; and then, in the concluding phase, the bile and the stones are jolted out of the gallbladder into the\nsmall intestine.\nHOW TO DO IT—There are several ways this can be done:\n1 - This method is used for the purpose of flushing out gallstones, after first softening them:\nTake 3 tbsp. of olive oil with the juice of a lemon before bed and upon awakening. Stones are often\npassed and eliminated in the stool with this method. Look for them. You can use grapefruit juice instead\nof lemon juice.\n2 - Here is a more involved three-day pattern for more effectively flushing gallstones:\nGo on a liver flush by drinking apple juice alone for 3 days. On the third day, the juice is followed by\ndrinking a cup of olive oil and a cup of lemon juice.\n3 - This method is used for cleaning out the liver and gallbladder rather than eliminating stones:\nTo cleanse the liver and gallbladder, drink as much pure apple juice as possible for 5 days. Add pear\njuice occasionally. Beet juice also cleanses the liver.\n4 - Here is a more complicated formula for doing the same thing:\nOn two evenings, drink 1 cup of a mixture, composed of equal parts of fresh lemon juice and olive oil (2\noz of each). On the third evening, take a double dose (4 oz of each).\nOn the following morning, take an enema, then a second enema to which 1 cup freshly brewed coffee\nhas been added. This coffee enema should be retained for as long as possible—up to 20 minutes. Repeat\nthis coffee enema in the evening.\nThe above treatment tends to cleanse the liver of toxins and impurities. Coffee, although never suitable\nfor drinking orally, has the peculiar quality of cleansing the liver when taken in enema form. As such, it\nis widely used to purify the liver so it can resist cancer and throw it off. It is well-known, among natural\nhealers, that the body can eliminate cancer if the liver is in good condition. (See cancer.)\nIn no other way is coffee ever useful inside the body; but, as medicine to cleanse the liver, it has been\nused with marked success.\n5 - This is a still more involved regime for restoring the functioning capacity of the liver and\ngallbladder. Slightly different than #2, above, it should not be used on anyone below the age of 25 or\nwho has large gallstones:\nOn Tuesday through Sunday noon, drink as much apple juice or apple cider as you are able, in addition\nto your regular meals.\nAt noon on Sunday, eat a normal lunch.\nThree hours later, dissolve 2 tsp. of disodium phosphate in an ounce of hot water, and drink it. It may\nnot taste good, so follow it with a little freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.\nTwo hours later, repeat the drinking of the disodium phosphate and the grapefruit juice.\nThat evening, only take citrus juice for supper.\nAt bedtime, either (1) drink a half cup of unrefined olive oil, followed by a small glass of grapefruit\njuice or (2) drink a half cup of warm, unrefined olive oil blended with a half cup of lemon juice.\nGo immediately to bed and lie on your right side with your right knee pulled up close to your chest for\n30 minutes.\nThe next morning, one hour before breakfast, drink 2 tsp. disodium phosphate, dissolved in 2 oz of hot\nwater.\nEat your meals as usual. The cleansing regime of the liver and gallbladder is completed.\nIn case there is slight to moderate nausea when taking the olive oil and citrus juice, this should be gone\nby the time you go to sleep.\nBut if the oil induces vomiting (which only happens rarely), you need not repeat the procedure at this\ntime. Drink a cup of strong peppermint tea, to help relieve the nausea.\nYou may find small gallstones in the stool the following day. They look light green to dark green, are\nvery irregular in shape, are the size of grape seeds to cherry seeds, and feel like gelatin. If there are a\nlarge number of them, repeat the liver flush in two weeks.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We see in the Word of God warnings and promises, with God behind them all.\nWe are invited to search this Word for aid when brought into difficult places. If we place God and the\nBible first, we will have divine help in meeting all our problems.\nSection 5\nGastro-Intestinal\nPart 7\nGallbladder\nGALLBLADDER INFLAMMATION (Cholecystitis)\nSYMPTOMS—Severe pain in the upper right abdomen, accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting.\nThe abdomen may be rigid and is usually tender to pressure at, or below, the lower edge of the ribs on\nthe right side.\nCAUSES—The gallbladder becomes inflamed. When it happens, it must be cared for immediately. If\nnot, you could die.\nAn acute infection of the gallbladder may be only catarrhal in nature, and recovery will come in a few\ndays. But, in more severe cases, the gallbladder fills with pus. Be very careful, and immediately treat\nthis condition. In case of pus in the gallbladder, there may be (and may not be) chills and fever.\nTherefore be alert, if chills and fever occur.\nThe presence of gallstones tends to irritate the lining of the gallbladder. Then bacteria in the bile are able\nto invade the wall and cause inflammation.\nInflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) produces similar symptoms (plus jaundice) to inflammation\nof the gallbladder, but the treatment is the same.",

Chills and fever may accompany the attack. The\nsymptoms often occur after the person has eaten fried or fatty foods.\nCAUSES—Gallstones may form in the gallbladder or (more rarely) in the bile ducts of the liver. They\nmay form in the gallbladder as a result of infection or inflammation of the gallbladder wall.\nThey occur more often in women than men, more often women who have given birth to children,\nespecially several of them. They are more frequent in obese women, and occur more often after the age\nof 40. In the United States, about 10-20% of the population have gallstones.\nPersons with diabetes, migraines, cancer of the gallbladder, cirrhosis, and pancreatitis are more likely to\nhave gallstones.\nGallstones are formed from bile, a brown digestive fluid produced by the liver. Cholesterol (a blood\nprotein) combines with the bile to form stones. But they do not look like regular \"stones.\" Whereas\nkidney stones are sharp and crystalline, gallstones are smooth, soft, and gelatinous. They feel like dense\nfat. Often persons with them have no symptoms.\nBut, when they block the exits of the liver or gallbladder, they produce nausea, vomiting, and pain, as\ndescribed above.",

This will reduce the swelling, inflammation, and\npain.\n- If you can avoid doing so, do not have an operation on your gallbladder. What they do is\ntake out your gallbladder, and you really need it.\n- Recent studies at the University of Pittsburg found that removing the gallbladder\n(cholecystectomy) doubled the risk of colon cancer.\nPREVENTING GALLSTONES—Here are several points to keep in mind:\nIt is an interesting fact that people who do not eat meat, dairy products, or eggs rarely have gallstone\nattacks. It is animal fat which tends to form gallstones.\nDrinking water helps prevent gallstone formation. It has been discovered that those with gallstones drink\nlittle water.\nDrinking a pint of water causes the gallbladder to empty about 10-20 minutes later. This is the ongoing\nway to keep the gallbladder cleaned out and in fairly good condition; that is, if you do not eat any fats of\nanimal origin.\nLack of exercise increases the likelihood of gallstone formation. Cholesterol is excreted more rapidly by\nthe liver and bladder with more exercise. The truth is that everything works better when you exercise\nregularly.\nDo not overeat. This is very important.\nDo not eat processed, fried, sugared, spicy, or junk foods.\nDo not use alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco.\nKeep your weight down. Overweight women over 40 who have had several children have the most\ngallstones.\nOral contraceptives (and other drugs containing estrogen) increase cholesterol saturation of bile.\nEating eggs greatly increases the likelihood of stone formation. A diet low in vitamin C also does.\nEating lots of refined carbohydrates increase stone formation. Not including enough fiber in the diet\ndoes also.\nTaking 2 tbsp. of lecithin each day immediately results in increased phospholipid concentration in the\nbile.

This can cause the appendix to rupture!\n- Undertake a water fast immediately. Drink small amounts every so often. Take 2 myrrh/\ngoldenseal capsules every 2 hours.

Water applications, placed on certain areas of the\nbody, will affect other areas (p. 25). The naval affects the appendix. So place an ice cap or ice bag\n(about one-half full of finely chopped ice) on the naval. This will draw inflammation away from the\nappendix (p. 50).\nThe second application is based on the derivation principle. You can draw blood away from one area, by\nplacing hot packs on a distant area. A hot Hip-and-Leg Pack is applied, plus placing an ice bag on the\nappendicial area (p. 97).\nMany cases of appendicitis heal without need for an operation to remove the appendix. But you must be\nvery careful.\n—Also see \"Appendicitis, Chronic,\" just below.\nOne of the false theories, dreamed up by evolutionists nearly a century ago, was the idea that many\norgans in the human body are useless and only relics given us by our ancestors. But, in recent decades,\nall of these \"useless\" organs (including the thyroid) have been found to have important functions. The\ntonsils protect the gastro-intestinal tract where it begins, and the appendicitis guards it where the small\nintestines end. The appendix is a lymphatic structure.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Let your confidence in the enabling power of Christ increase daily. He alone\ncan enable you to resist temptation. He alone can give you the guidance you need throughout the day.",

Avoid poisonous substances and\nemotional tension. Relax, thank God for your blessings, and take time to be a blessing to\nothers. Follow the advice in this paragraph, and many of your problems will vanish.\n- As soon as you awake, start drinking warm water, a little at a time. By the time you are\nready for breakfast, you should have at least taken a quart. Faithfully following this\nregime, you will tend to develop regularity in your morning bowel movement. This plan\nnicely starts the day off right.\n- Then, after breakfast and every other meal, go outside and walk a little or a lot. Breathe\ndeeply.\n- The larger the amount of fiber in the diet, the larger and softer will the stools be.\n- Eat smaller amounts of food at each meal.\nConcentrated foods, such as meats, sugar, and cheese are excellent for producing\nconstipation.\n- Dairy foods, soft drinks, white flour, salt, coffee, alcohol, highly processed foods, and\nsugary foods should not be used, if you want to solve this problem.\n- Iron supplements cause constipation. So do painkillers and antidepressants.\n- All decongestants and antihistamines are drying agents, and may cause the stool to\nbecome dryer than it should.\n- Eat prunes or figs. Flaxseed meal (best freshly ground) is helpful. Both will soften\nstools. Psyllium seed is also good, but take it quickly with a full glassful of water.\n- When necessary, take cleansing enemas to relieve the load on the bowel. But the solution\nis better living, not reliance on enemas.\n- A small, cold enema helps eliminate the enema habit. (See \"Enema Habit, how to\novercome.\")\n- There is always the possibility that, if constipation occurs too frequently, that cancer, or\nsome other obstruction of the bowel, may be involved. Other symptoms of colon cancer\ninclude severe cramping; blood in the stool; a tender, distended abdomen; and very\nnarrowed feces. But cancer can be present without these symptoms occurring.\n- Alternate diarrhea and constipation may point to irritable bowel syndrome (which see).\n—Also see \"Constipation—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The fallen world is the battlefield for the greatest conflict the heavenly\nuniverse and earthly powers have ever witnessed.

(3) If due to pain in abdomen: Revulsive Compress; Revulsive\nDouche; Hot Enema at 1100 F., followed by small cool Enema; Revulsive Sitz Bath.\nRELIEVE SPASM OF SPHINCTER ANI MUSCLE—Prolonged Neutral or Hot Sitz Bath; Warm\nColonic; Hot Colonic; Fomentations over the nates (the \"nates\" are the fleshy prominences formed by\nthe gluteal muscles—the area where a child is spanked).\nRESTORE SENSIBILITY OF RECTUM—Alternate Hot and Cold Colonic, Cold Douche to lower\nspine and nates. Shallow Cold Sitz, Cold Anal Douche, Alternate Anal Douche.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—Strictly avoid Sweating Baths that sometimes induce Constipation, also\nabuse of the Fomentation and the habitual use of the Warm Enema, which should be strictly avoided. If\nthe Enema is used daily, the temperature, at least at the conclusion of the enema, should be 650-75o F.,\nso that a tonic effect may be secured.\nGENERAL METHOD—Each case must be carefully studied, with reference to the leading cause or\ncauses which are operative in the individual case. Most important of these are the following: aparalytic\nor atonic condition of the intestine through disturbed or defective innervation; diminished intestinal\nsecretion or an abnormal absorption of intestinal secretion, resulting in unusually dry and solid fecal\nmass; dilatation of the colon, giving rise to accumulation; relaxation and weakness of the abdominal\nmuscles with lowered intra-abdominal tension; hemorrhoids and other diseases of the rectum; prolapse\nof the colon and other abdominal viscera; loss of normal sensibility of the rectum; spasm of the anal\nsphincter muscle.\n—Also see \"Constipation—1.\"",

      "overview": "- Because of the ongoing diarrhea, people with IBS require as much as 30% more protein\nthan normal, as well as an increased intake of minerals and trace elements.\n- Avoid xanthine-containing foods such as chocolate, tea, coffee, and spicy foods. Also\navoid drugs, cold liquids, and carbonated beverages. All these may produce diarrhea.\n- Milk may also induce diarrhea. Lactose intolerance and virus are leading causes of\ndiarrhea.\n- In case of chronic diarrhea, electrolyte and trace mineral deficiencies are likely.

Antibiotics and a number\nof other medicinal drugs cause it also.\n- While you have diarrhea, do not prepare food for others, and wash your hands carefully.\n- Some say to use bran and pectin foods, in order to tighten the bowels and stop the\ndiarrhea; others say to let it run its course, in order to rid the problem foods, etc., out of\nthe system. But, generally, it is considered best to use fiber foods to get the diarrhea\nstopped. When increasing fiber intake, also increase fluid intake.\n- The deciding factor is whether the diarrhea was caused by a bacteria or virus. If so, you\nwant the body to throw it off through the bowels, if (if) this will happen fairly rapidly.\n- Helpful herbs include white oak bark, an astringent which stops diarrhea.

      "overview": "- American travelers are often given Entero-Vioform tablets, which they are instructed to\ntake several times a day. But those medications are forbidden in Japan and Sweden,\nbecause they can cause severe nerve and eye damage.\n- Instead, take betaine hydrochloride (betaine HCl) tablets with you when you travel, and\nswallow two tablets after each meal. The hydrochloric acid will kill bacteria in the\nstomach and help prevent infection.\n- Straight lemon or lime juice, taken on an empty stomach, also has an sterilizing effect.\n- To make the situation even better, eat some raw garlic with your meals.\n- In cases of non-bacterial diarrhea, 3 tbsp. of raw, unprocessed wheat bran daily, taken in\nfruit juice, has been found to give relief.\nHere are more ideas for preventing turista from happening to you:\n- Drink acidic drinks, such as fruit juice or whatever else you can get overseas. If you\ncannot do better, drink carbonated beverages sealed in bottles or cans.\n- Try to make sure the dishes and eating utensils have been cleaned in purified water, and,\nhopefully, rinsed in very hot water.\n- Avoid uncooked vegetables. This includes salads, fruits you cannot peel, ice cubes, and\nanything that unpurified water is in.\n- Boil water for 3-5 minutes to purify it. Iodine liquid or tablets purifies it also.\nThere is danger, when traveling overseas (or even if you remain at home) that the diarrhea may indicate\nsomething more serious:\n- Abdominal bloating, vomiting, and pain can point to colitis, appendicitis, or an intestinal\nobstruction.\n- Black or red stools can indicate bleeding or a parasitic infection.\n- White or pale stools can signify disease of the liver.\n- If fever occurs with the diarrhea, then a serious infection may be involved.\n- Amoebic dysentery is a serious problem in Mexico, Central America, and a number of\nother places. If you contract it, garlic, goldenseal, colchicum, peppermint, and ginger have\nbeen used successfully against it. When in doubt, burn a wooden box, gather the charcoal\ntogether and swallow it in water.\nHere are other homemade ways to eliminate diarrhea:\n- Take dried blueberries with you. They tend to constipate and thus eliminate the diarrhea.\nBlackberry root is equally good. Make it into a tea and drink it.\n- Plantain is strongly astringent, so is white oak bark.\n- Cook down apple peels and drink it. The pectin in it helps eliminate diarrhea.\n- Tannic acid is in acorns and oak bark. It is a powerful astringent, and will stop the\nmuscular contractions of the intestines.\n- Not only charcoal, but clay is also useful in stopping diarrhea. Many commercial\nantidiarrheal preparations contain clay.\n—Also see \"Diarrhea and Dysentery.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Happy is the man who has discovered for himself that the Word of God is a\nlight to his feet and a lamp to his path. It is alight shining in a dark place. It is heaven's guidebook for\nmankind.\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (Mucous Colitis, Spastic Colitis,\nIntestinal Neurosis)\nSYMPTOMS—There are three basic patterns:\n(1) constipation and pain; (2) alternating constipation and diarrhea; (3) and painless diarrhea with\nmucous. Diarrhea frequently occurs upon arising, and again following breakfast. For the remainder of\nthe day, he may be constipated. Diarrhea at night is rare. Instead of diarrhea, stools sometimes are pasty\nand very narrow.\nAlso present may be gas, nausea, bad breath, heartburn, severe headaches, bloating, lack of appetite,\nweakness, faintness, backache, and heart palpitations.\nPain is often triggered by eating, and may be relieved by a bowel movement.\nA fifth of those with this problem also experience rectal bleeding.\nCAUSES—Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common digestive problem which patients see\ntheir doctor about. About one-fifth of Americans have the problem. Primarily occurring between the age\nof 20 and 50, women have it twice as often as men. It is said that three-fourths of the population\nexperience it at some time in their lives. Yet IBS is comparatively unknown in cultures where people eat\nsimply, and not too much of it.\nThe fundamental problem is that the muscles of the small and large intestines contract in spasms rather\nthan regularly. Something in the food bothers the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract,—probably the totality of\nthe strange things Westerners eat: processed, greasy, fried, sugared, chemicaled, synthetic, drugged, and\nalcoholed food; and eaten hurriedly, at irregular times.\nThese spasms cause the food to pass through the GI tract either too fast or too slow. When too slowly,\ntoo much water is absorbed, causing hard, dry stools; when too fast, too little water is absorbed and the\nstools are watery.\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a nuisance, but is not life-threatening. But be aware that symptoms of IBS\nmay indicate more serious problems, which sometimes are related by IBS: arthritis, diabetes mellitus,\ngallbladder disease, malabsorption disorders, candidiasis, pancreatic insufficiency, skin disorders, ulcers,\ncolon cancer, and parasitic infections, such as amoebiasis and giardiasis.\nThere are diseases which have similar symptoms, such as diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative\ncolitis, and lactose intolerance.",

      "overview": "- To relieve GI pain and expel the gas, take an enema, use a heating pad, hot water bottle,\nhot fomentations to the abdomen, lukewarm enemas—given slowly. Moist heat will be\nmore effective than dry heat, since it penetrates better. If the pain is severe, apply the heat\nfor an hour, remove for an hour, and then apply again for an hour, until relief comes.\n- Take charcoal tablets, to relieve gas and bloating. But do not use it daily or it will cause\nconstipation.\n- The pain may be sharply increased by drinking cold liquids and eating food. It is now\nknown that the pain is generally associated with constipation. (See \"Constipation.\")\n- The person may think he has too much gas, but studies reveal only that the normal\namount of gas in his intestines bothers him more. But it would still be wise to avoid gasforming foods. (See \"Bloating\" and \"Belching.\") Avoid swallowing air. Do not chew gum\nor smoke, drink enough water, and avoid carbonated beverages.\n- Eat more bran (oat bran, etc.) and it will produce more normal bowel movements.\nCoarse bran works better than fine bran. A high fiber diet is particularly important in\nsolving IBS.\n- Add crushed psyllium seed to your diet.\n- Avoid stress, strain, worry, and rush.\n- Avoid tobacco, tea, coffee, soft drinks, alcohol, and drugs.\n- Research shows that refined sugar needs to be avoided if you want to return to normal\nliving.\n- Do not use sugar substitutes (sorbitol, etc.).\n- Do not take antacids or laxatives.\n- Eat on a regular schedule. Do not skip meals or eat between meals. Let your digestive\nsystem rest before the next meal. Five hours between meals is a good rule.\n- Do not eat before going to bed.\n- Search for your food allergies. Keep written records and take the pulse test. (See\n\"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\")\n- Avoid animal fats, butter, fried foods, and dairy products.\n- Because of the ongoing diarrhea, people with IBS require as much as 30% more protein\nthan normal, as well as an increased intake of minerals and trace elements. (See\n\"Diarrhea.\")\n- Studies of patients revealed that 70% of those with IBS had a lactose-intolerance\nproblem. They needed to stop drinking milk in order to partially, or wholly, solve the\nproblem.\n- Regular out-of-door exercise is needed in order to maintain good bowel health.\n- If you want success, stay totally away from cigarette smoke.\n- Do not use medicinal or street drugs if you want improvement.\n- When your intestines upset you, temporarily go on a bland diet. Put vegetables and\nnonacidic fruits through a blender. But be sure and include fiber if you are on a soft diet,\nand some protein.\n- Wear loose-fitting clothing.\n—Also see \"Colitis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—There is a great work to be done in our world, and God has a plan just for you.\nHe has a place for you to work and, though it seems to be ever so insignificant, if you will fill it to the\nbest of your ability, ever trusting in Him for help, He will approve.\nCOLITIS (Ulcerative Colitis)\nSYMPTOMS—Bloody diarrhea, bloody mucous, gas, pain, bloating, incomplete elimination of the\nbowels, weakness, weight loss, indigestion, headaches, and sometimes hard stools. Diverticula are often\nproduced.\nCAUSES—Colitis is a disease of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis is a more severe variation of it.\nThe symptoms and treatment of both are about the same.\nColitis is a chronic infection of the lower bowel. The mucous membrane wall becomes irritated as a\nresult of fecal matter which has accumulated, because of constipation. In other words, the person did not\nhave regular bowel movements, and so the bowel wall became infected as a result.\nOver-the-counter laxatives, cooking in aluminum utensils, overeating of refined carbohydrates, too\nmuch sugar in the diet, and food allergies are other causes.\nConstipation causes the person to strain. This produces diverticula (see \"Diverticulitis\"), small pockets\nwhich fill with waste matter and toxins.\nLow-fiber diets, wrong food combinations, and poor bowel habits—all work together to cause trouble.\nToxic bacteria multiplies quickly when retained in the lower bowel too long.\nNervous tension and emotional stress intensifies the problem.\nAntibiotics change the intestinal flora, and that can also produce colitis.\nIt is important that you try to find the underlying cause of the colitis, otherwise it will be difficult to\neliminate it.\nMore rarely, the intestinal wall weakens, balloons out, and could possibly rupture. This is called toxic\nmagacolon.",

Eat cooked or steamed green\nleafy vegetables, cooked white potatoes, multigrain bread, and well-cooked oat bran,\nbrown rice, millet, sweet potatoes, bananas, cooked carrots, squash, and avocados.\n- Drink fresh, raw cabbage, carrot, celery and parsley juices, to help heal the colitis.\n- Do not eat fruit on an empty stomach, but at the end of the meal, until the colitis is gone.\n- Avoid milk products, for they irritate the colon. Wheat products may do it also.\n- Poorly digested roughage can be the problem. Chew your food well. Your intestines\nneed fiber, but not chunks of food.\n- Undigested cereals and carbohydrates are another cause. Take digestive enzymes and\nsmaller, more frequent, meals.\n- Use the pulse test, to ascertain whether allergic foods are being eaten. (See \"Pulse Test.\")\n- When no open peptic or intestinal ulcers are present, take 2-3 tablets of betaine\nhydrochloride (betaine HCl) after each meal with a glass of water. This will help the\nstomach digest proteins and carbohydrates.\n- Slippery elm is very soothing and healing to the bowel. Mix one tsp. of powdered\nslippery elm with one pint of boiling water, blend well, add something for flavoring, and\ndrink slowly.\n- Alfalfa, garlic, and papaya are also useful.\n- Helpful herbs include aloe vera, myrrh, and pau d'arco.\n—Also see \"Crohn's Disease\" for additional information on ulcerative colitis. See \"Irritable Bowel\nSyndrome\" for more on colitis.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We are to love God with all our mind, and soul, and body. Give Him your life,\nand let Him use you to be a blessing to all those around you. There is no other way to be genuinely\nhappy.\nCROHN'S DISEASE (Regional Enteritis; Ulcerative Colitis)\nSYMPTOMS—Loss of energy, appetite, and weight. Chronic diarrhea, fever, chronic rectal bleeding,\nmalabsorption, pain in the entire abdomen, excess fat in the stool (resulting in pale, bulky stools that\nfloat). Malnutrition results.\nCAUSES—Crohn's disease is also known as regional enteritis. Ulcerative colitis is a different disorder,\nbut similar enough in symptoms and treatment that we will list them together.\nThe difference is that ulcerative colitis only involves the first two layers of the intestinal wall (the\nmucosa and submucosa); whereas Crohn's disease also affects the next two layers (the connective tissue\nand the wall muscles).\nCrohn's disease is a chronic ulceration of one or more sections of the digestive tract. Three special facts\nare (1) the ulceration reaches into all layers of the gastro-intestinal (GI) wall, (2) the entire GI tract can\nbe involved, from mouth to the anus, and (3) this is usually a long-lasting condition.\nAs the inflamed portions heal, scar tissue remains, which keeps narrowing the channel.\nMany puzzles still surround this condition. The origin is not clearly understood, and certain racial groups\ncontract it more than others (Jews have it more than anyone else).\nBut certain facts stand out:\nFood food allergies may help it start, and identifying and avoiding them helps reduce it.\nA lack of vitamins C and E in the diet aggravates the problem.\nPeople in Europe and North America have it far more than those living elsewhere in the world.\nJews in America have it much more than Jews in Israel. Caucasians have it less often than Jews, but\nmore often than other races.\nTherefore it is likely that the modern, Western, diet is a significant factor. Eating simple, nourishing\nfood is an important aspect of dealing with this problem.\nRarely does the disease strike once and go away. Most of the time it recurs for years. When this\nhappens, the ongoing scarring keeps reducing bowel functions.\nIf ignored, eventually Crohn's disease can lead to cancer.\nNo definite cure is known, but certain things tend to alleviate the problem.\nIt is believed that Crohn's disease is an autoimmune problem; that is, the GI tract has become so toxic\nfrom years of mistreatment, that the immune system becomes confused and begins attacking the part of\nthe body housing the toxic food.",

It is known that those with Crohn's disease cannot absorb fats well\nand do not tolerate high-fat diets.\n- Do not use spices, such as mustard, vinegar, pepper, and horseradish.\n- Drink plenty of liquids, such as distilled water and fresh juices.\n- Cabbage juice contains vitamin U, the anti-ulcer vitamin, which is good for the walls of\nthe GI tract.\n- Of course, eat no junk food, tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, and useless things which only\nharm you.\n- Eliminate all food additives. Do not use sugar or sugar foods. One study revealed that\npatients contracting Crohn's disease had previously been eating more sugar than the\naverage population. Eat high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrates (whole grains). However,\ngradually increase the fiber content, all the while chewing well, so as not to irritate the GI\ntract. If you cannot chew well, then blend the food.\n- Individuals who contracted Crohn's disease were found to have eaten few raw fruits and\nvegetables prior to developing the condition.\n- Mainly eat nonacidic fresh or cooked vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, carrots,\ncelery, kale, garlic, and Brussels sprouts. Never fry anything.\n- Avoid overeating, in order to reduce the inflammation of the GI wall.\n- Gluten tends to make the problem worse. So avoid gluten-containing grains (which are\nwheat, oats, rye, barley, and buckwheat). Remarkable results can be obtained, but the\ngluten-free diet must be strictly adhered to; not even tiny amounts in the diet may be\npermitted.\n- Lactose intolerance is frequent. Avoid all milk products.\n- Eliminate all possible food allergies and other allergies. Crohn's patients tend to have\nallergic conditions, such as hay fever and eczema.\n- Regularly obtain sunshine and fresh air.\n- Avoid stress, anxiety, and worry. Keep calm and relaxed. Avoid even exciting,\ncompetitive games.\n- Charcoal will help control the diarrhea. Take 4-6 tablets, 2-3 times a day between meals.\nIf the charcoal irritates the colon, stir the charcoal into water, let the charcoal settle to the\nbottom, and only drink the apparently clear top part.\n- Make sure the bowels move daily.\n- Surgary, antidiarrheal drugs, and corticosteroids should be avoided. They worsen the\ncondition rather than improving it. A full 50% of those who undergo surgery report a\nrapid increase in symptoms afterward.\n- Helpful herbs are black walnut, burdock, goldenseal, pau d'arco, psyllium, saffron, aloe\nvera, fenugreek, slippery elm, and white oak bark.\n—Also see \"Ulcerative Colitis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—There is a mighty power in prayer.

The pain may be localized in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and may be constant.\nSometimes there is a brief period of diarrhea.\nCAUSES—Diverticula are small pouch-like sacs on the inside of the large bowel, generally in the\ndescending colon. When a person is constipated, he tends to push too hard. The air pressure exerted by\nthis muscular squeeze on the bowel muscles can force small pockets to form in the walls of the lower\ncolon.\nOnce they form, diverticula never go away. Of themselves, they provide no symptoms. The problem is\nthat fecal matter can collect in them and eventually attract bacteria. This results in infection or\ninflammation, which produces the fever, chills, and pain.\nDiverticulosis is when you have diverticula. It is basically symptomless. Diverticulitis is when they are\ninflamed or infected; then the unfortunate symptoms reveal themselves.\nThis is another disease caused by \"civilized\" refined and junk foods. It is practically unknown in Third\nWorld nations, and was almost totally unknown before our century.\nMore than half of those over 60 in America have this problem.",

Psyllium seed and flaxseed also help soften the stools.\n- Have a bowel movement when you sense you ought to. Do not wait.\n- Obtain adequate exercise, especially out-of-doors.\n- Prunes, pureed fruit juices, and herb teas are very helpful.\n- Carrot, beet, celery, and green juices are excellent. Of the fruit juices, papaya, apple,\npineapple, and lemon are outstanding for your purposes.\n- Chew nuts, seeds, and popcorn well, so they will be less likely to enter the diverticula.\n- Eat smaller meals.\n- Rats placed on high-fat diets, for 90 weeks, all developed colon diverticula.\n- Avoid caffeine products. They all tend to irritate the colon.\n- Do not eat a lot of sugar.\n- Smoking and stress make the symptoms worse.\n- Girdles, belts, and tight bands around the waist tend to increase abdominal pressure on\nthe colon.\n- Helpful herbs include slippery elm, peppermint, chamomile, and aloe vera.\nDURING AN ATTACK—As soon as an attack begins, give yourself a cleansing enema (2 quarts of\nwater and the juice of a fresh lemon). Take 4 charcoal tablets with a large glass of water.\nIn case of pain or spasm in the colon, apply a heating pad over the abdomen.\nDuring the acute phase of an attack, it may be best to eat a low-fiber diet for a short time. Then return to\nthe high-fiber regime.\nIf the attack is severe, temporarily blend your food. Drink carrot, cabbage, and green juices.\nTo relieve pain, massage the abdomen on the left side. Stand up and stretch.\nTry to have bowel movements on schedule. Take fiber first thing in the morning, and down a quart of\nwater before breakfast.\nCheck your stools daily. If they are black, this means blood is present; take a sample to a physician.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ's followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men.

    "title": "# Enema Habit, To Overcome",
    "fields": {
      "overview": "PROBLEM—Having taken enemas for a long time, you find you cannot have a bowel movement\nwithout taking another.\nSOLUTION—A small, cold enema is especially useful in retraining the colon to evacuate normally by\nitself. Cold water has a bracing, strengthening, enlivening effect.\nIn hydrotherapy, the enema is considered cold if the temperature is 55-70o F.; whereas it is only cool if it\nis 70-80o F. The cold enema is a powerful stimulant to bowel movements and should be more generally\nused for this purpose instead of the warm enema. Use the cold enema to overcome both the enema habit\nand the cathartic habit (always needing a laxative).\nObtain an ear irrigation syringe from the drugstore, and inject one syringeful of cold water into the\nrectum. Hold it for one minute, and expel. A bowel movement will generally follow. Use this treatment\nat the same time every day, to establish a pattern of regularity.\nLAXATIVE AGENTS—Laxatives are supposed to promote bowel movements, but some only hinder\nit.\nBran, psyllium, and raw fruits and vegetables are bulk-forming agents, and are not referred to as\n\"laxatives.\" They are ideal ways to promote bowel movements, and are safe to use on a long-term basis.\nMineral oil and docusate sodium are stool softening agents. If used at all, they should only be used\ntemporarily. The mineral oil can damage the lungs, if inhaled, and absorbs fat-soluble vitamins in the\ndigestive tract. Docusate sodium increases toxicity of other drugs, and may cause liver damage.\nSalts are osmotic agents, which draw water into the bowel for a flush. These are safe if used only\noccasionally, but otherwise can initiate dependency. In addition, some people dare not take extra salts\ninto their body. Examples include milk of magnesia, Epsom salts, and table salt.\nStimulant agents cause a laxative effect by irritating the intestinal walls and induce peristalsis. But they\ncan result in dependency and can damage the bowels. Examples include various drugstore items; castor\noil; senna; and laxative herbs, such as cascara sagrada.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Friendship with God, what privilege can be greater? Study His Bible, pray\noften, and tell others how wonderful He is. Tell them that God is love. This can give them the peace and\nrest they so much want.\nSection 5\nGastro-Intestinal\nPart 10\nAnus\nHEMORRHOIDS—1 (Piles)\nSYMPTOMS—Burning, pain, itching, inflammation, swelling, irritation, seepage, and bleeding.\nCAUSES—Hemorrhoids are enlarged varicose veins, found in the anus and rectum.\nThose occurring below the internal sphincter (a circular muscle which closes the rectum) are called\nexternal hemorrhoids. Those above that sphincter are called internal hemorrhoids.\nInternal hemorrhoids are generally painless, but often bleed. When they do, the blood is bright red.\nExternal hemorrhoids are also called piles. Sometimes they protrude from the anus. Because they\nenlarge and lose their elasticity, they often form little sacs which protrude into the anal canal. The skin\nabove them turns blue or purple and can be extremely painful.\nA prolapsed hemorrhoid is an internal one which is protruding outside the anus. Often there is a mucous\ndischarge and heavy bleeding. They can be very painful.\nWhen they bleed, a fair amount of blood can issue forth. But it does not indicate a serious disease.\nOlder people are more likely to have them. Pregnant women, and women who have had children, tend to\nhave hemorrhoids more often than other younger people.\nCirculatory weakness of the veins, along with constipation, are primary causes of hemorrhoids. Liver\ncongestion can also be a factor.\nAny condition which increases pressure on that area or reduces the flow of blood through those veins\ncan induce hemorrhoids.\nHemorrhoids are common in folk who live on junk food diets, low-fiber diets, lack exercise, are sitting\nwhile working (especially sitting when tense and nervous), do heavy lifting, are obese, pregnant,\nstraining at the stool, heavily coughing, frequently sneezing, have prolonged use of laxatives or enemas,\nhave elevated pressure on the portal vein of the liver (as occurs in cirrhosis of the liver), and sit on\nsomething cold.",

Do not hold your breath\nas you lift. Instead, take a deep breath and exhale at the moment of lifting. Avoid heavy\nlifting as much as possible.\n- Do not sit on anything which does not warm up (a rock, steel, the ground) for periods of\ntime.\n- Do not forget the high-fiber diet; it, and a proper diet, is crucial to success in avoiding or\nmanaging this problem.\n- Use soft toilet paper, and only dab with it. Use only non-perfumed, white toilet paper.\n- Do not scratch the area.\n- Diarrhea intensifies the problem, so avoid this. (See \"Diarrhea.\") For the same reason,\navoid constipation (which see).\n- Sitz (sitting) baths soothe inflamed tissues and relax spasms of the rectal and anal\nmuscles.\n- Apply cold witch hazel tea , to help shrink them.\n- In severe cases, take an alternating hot and cold sitz (sitting) bath. Use two large\ngalvanized wash tubs, propped up at one one end, to make sitting in them more\ncomfortable. Fold a large towel and place it in the bottom and sides, for comfort. Fill one\nwith hot water (100o F.), the other with tap water. Sit in the hot, for 5 minutes, and in the\ncold, for 30 seconds. Spread the buttocks, as you do this, so the temperature changes will\nhave the best effect on the desired area. Do this 3 times. You can come back later and do it\nagain as needed.\n- An alternate method, to use in less severe cases, is to sit in a bathtub of 10-12 inches of\nhot water. Do this 3-5 times a day.\n- Cranberry poultices are helpful. Blend a handful, wrap a tablespoonful in cloth, and lay\nagainst the area. Change an hour later, and repeat when you wish.\n- Dab lecithin on the area, as you would Vaseline.\n- An ice pack to that area may also bring relief.\n- Peel a garlic bulb and scrape it, to get the juice, to flow. Then insert it. It will be expelled\nthe next day during elimination. Do this 3 times a week.\n- Cut a piece of aloe vera, about 2½ inches in length, peel, and insert.\n- Applications of white oak bark tea or witch hazel will, through astringent action, tend to\nshrink the hemorrhoids.\n- Medicinal drugs generally contain local anesthetics, but these often irritate the area and\ndelay healing.\n- A 1976 report stated that there was no evidence that any of the ingredients in\nPreparation H could reduce inflammation or shrink hemorrhoids.\n- Aspirin will intensify the bleeding.\n- Prolapsed hemorrhoids can become thrombosed; that is, they can form clots inside them\nwhich prevent their receding. Severe, increased pain indicates this has happened. Go to a\nphysician, to remove the clot. This is not the same as a hemorrhoidectomy, and is a\nsimple, rapid treatment.\n- In case of persistent, severe problems, some may choose to have hemorrhoidectomy\ndone. Find a physician who has done this and adequately knows what to do.\nA Personal testimony:\nI have essentially been cured of my hemorrhoids with the following treatment;\nI suffered with hemmorhoids for nearly 10 years, practically living on Preparation H,\nand often in great pain. Again and again I had to have surgery for clots. This was\nextremely unpleasant and painful, but the alternative was months of being almost unable\nto walk at all.\nOn one occasion I developed four clots, and an extremely painful flareup. I was out of\nall medication for the pain, and was desparate. I looked around for anything that might\nhelp.\nI had on hand a solution that we had used on animals for skin problems. It consisted of\n9 parts colloidal silver (liquid, electrically made), and 1 part DMSO. I knew that the\nDMSO had pain-relieving properties, and decided to try in on my hemmorhoids, which I\ndid.\nThe pain relief was not spectacular, but it did help some. So every 20 to 30 minutes\nwhen the pain got bad, I applied it again. After a day or so, I noticed that the pain was\ndefinitely getting better, and I had to apply the mixture less frequently.\nIt was really helping, so over the next few days and weeks I continued the treatment, and\nthe pattern continued of needing the application less and less often. In amazement I\nrealized that the clots were actually dissolving! Nothing but surgery had ever gotten rid of\nthem before! And, in time, all the swelling went away.\nIt has been years since this occurred. Once in a while I will have a twinge of pain, and\nwill apply the solution again. But one application is usually sufficient to remove all\nsymptoms. For months at a time I have absolutely no symptoms at all.\nIf you have further questions about how I applied this remarkable remedy, you can\ncontact me at jeannie@ucinet.com.\n—Also see \"Hemorrhoids—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Bible religion is to be interwoven into everything we do and say.

Let Him use you to be the blessing to others, which they so much need.\nRECTAL ITCHING (Pruritis Ani, Anus Itch)\nSYMPTOMS—Itching around the anus.\nCAUSES—Causes include infection, parasites, poor hygiene, diabetes, estrogen deficiency, or liver\ndisease. Skin diseases, such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and eczema can also cause it. Another\npossible cause is contact dermatitis, due to perfumed or dyed toilet tissue, deodorants, soap, or\nunderclothing. Food allergies are thought to be another cause.\nRectal itching is a symptom of a problem rather than a disease. Resolving the basic problem is essential\nto eliminating the itching.\nPinworms are frequently the cause in children, but rarely in adults. (See pinworms in \"Worms.\")",

High-strung individuals tend to have this problem more than\nothers. Their nerves are on edge.\n- Use wet tissue to clean the area after a bowel movement, but do not leave the area wet.\n- Eliminating moisture from the area is a key factor. Moisture, leakage, and fecal soiling\nare frequently primary causes.\n- Do not use anesthetic medications with \"caine\" in the name. They produce strong\nallergic reactions, making the condition worse. They also tend to keep moisture on the\narea.\n- Avoid using soap in the area, for soap is highly alkaline.\n- After a bowel movement, it will help to wash the area with a syringe of water. Dry\nthoroughly afterward.\n- Take a hot sitz bath daily. After the bath, apply lemon juice to the area with a piece of\ncotton. Or rub wheat germ oil on all affected parts after washing and drying well.\n- A warm (not hot) tea bag of goldenseal may be applied to the area for up to a half hour,\nto relieve itching.\n- Avoid tight clothing of any type in the abdominal area.\n- Avoid drugs; many irritate the colon, leading to pruritus.\n—Also see pinworms under \"Worms.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Resolve that, not in your own strength, but in the strength and grace given of\nGod, that you will consecrate to Him now, just now, every power and ability of your life.\nSection 5\nGastro-Intestinal\nPart 11\nDigestive",

They fear food and weight gain, and will hardly eat.\nBulimia describes people who try to eat less, then go on eating binges because they feel starved. Each\none is concluded by purging (induced vomiting) in order to bring up the food eaten. (See \"Bulimia.\")\nBelieving they are overweight, fearful of gaining more, these individuals rather consistently try to keep\nthemselves starved. They tend to have low self-esteem, and often are depressed. Certain that they look\nterrible, and sure that eating still less might solve the problem, these folk have a thinking pattern which\nis difficult to change.\nIn some cases, drug and/or alcohol abuse is also involved.\nLack of proper nutrition tends to intensify the feelings and attitudes.\nAlmost all anorexics are women, typically between the ages of 12 to 18.\nThe word, \"anorexia,\" means \"appetite loss,\" and technically could apply to anyone who has an ongoing\ndisinclination to eat food. This can be caused by stress, malnutrition, shock, or injury. But, today, the\nterm is generally applied only to those who have anorexia nervosa. This article only applies to this latter\ndefinition.\nSome consider anorexia nervosa to be a psychiatric illness. Others believe that reaction to a strong,\nunderlying collection of allergenic foods is the problem. The often repeated phrase, \"I always feel better\nwhen I don't eat, and feel bad when I do,\" can apply to both viewpoints.\nAbout a third of those with this problem prematurely die from starvation, infections, heart disorders, or\nsuicide.\nThe underlying cause must be dealt with. Love and understanding is needed. Help from someone outside\nthe family may be needed. However, there is danger in consulting professional counselors or\npsychologists, since they have been trained in hypnotic procedures; a growing number of instances are\noccurring where so-called \"repressed memories\" are implanted in the counselee. —And that only adds to\nthe problems!",

This is followed by purging (induced vomiting) or the taking of laxatives, so\nthe food will be eliminated without being properly digested. (Also see \"Anorexia nervosa.\")\nBulimia can result in serious physical problems, including hypoglycemia, internal bleeding, ulcers,\nerratic heartbeat, kidney damage, menstrual cessation, low pulse rate and blood pressure, and glandular\ndamage.\nSome bulimiacs overdo on exercise, in order to better manage weight and somehow improve an already\nunbalanced situation.\nProfessions requiring a beautiful appearance are where we are most likely to find bulimiacs (models,\nactors, dancers, ballet dancers). By her own admission, Princess Diane is a bulimiac. Thinness is equated\nwith beauty by many people.\nOddly enough, while anorexics tend to be overly thin, bulimiacs are generally just right; not too heavy or\ntoo thin.\nBut their way of life may produce hair loss, yellow skin, premature wrinkles, muscle fatigue, dizziness,\nand extreme weakness.\nThe primary physical signs are those which are caused by sessions of induced vomiting: swollen salivary\nglands, constant sore throat, hiatal hernia, esophageal inflammation, erosion of the enamel of the back\nteeth, swollen glands in the face and neck, and broken blood vessels in the face.\nIf laxative abuse is done, then rectal bleeding, bowel damage, and chronic diarrhea may result.\nExcessive laxative use removes an excess of potassium and sodium, leading to muscle spasms,\ndehydration, and eventual cardiac arrest.\nBulimiacs tend to have low levels of serotonin, which can lead to increased cravings for simple\ncarbohydrates (sugars). Yet it is likely that the binges produced those chronically low levels.",

A\nsimple, nourishing diet is urgently needed in order to restore the needed balance in life.\n- The person should expect to experience temporary anxiety, depression, insomnia, and\npossible irritation, as he attempts to break with the old way of life. But the rewards are\noutstanding and well- worth the effort.\n- CCK (cholecystokinin-pancreozymin) is a hormone, found in the small intestine and\nbrain which signals a satisfied feeling and that it is time to stop eating. When a person gets\ninto a pattern of overeating, that hormone is not properly produced. So the person only\nfeels satisfied after heavily overeating a meal.\n- The only solution is to rigorously eat just so much, even though it does not seem like\nenough. Eventually, the hormone will start being produced again in the proper amount at\nthe proper time.\n—Also see \"Anorexia nervosa.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—For Christ's sake, we are to endure trials.

Other symptoms\ninclude frequently pale and/or light-yellow, foul-smelling stools that float; fatigue; depression;\nabdominal swelling; muscle cramps; wasting; and bone and/or joint pain. Diarrhea is the most\ncommonly observed symptom.\nInfants and children may show vomiting; stunted growth; intense burning sensation of the skin; and a\nred, itchy skin rash. Ulcers may develop in the mouth. The child may look anemic and undernourished.\nBabies may lose weight or gain it more slowly, and do not seem to be thriving well. The disease can\nbegin in the first few months of life.\nCAUSES—Celiac disease affects the small intestine. There are abnormalities in the intestinal lining, due\nto a permanent intolerance to gluten. Gluten is in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. (Corn, rice, millet,\nsoybeans, quinoa, and amaranth do not contain gluten. There seems to be a little uncertainty about\nbuckwheat.) The protein, gliaden, is thought to be the toxic part of the gluten. It interacts with the lining\nof the intestines, causing the tiny absorptive fingers which jut from it (the villi) to flatten and atrophy.\nAs a result, nutrients are not absorbed (including vitamins A, D, and K) and the disease symptoms\nappear.\nUnfortunately, many physicians and the food industries recommend that grains be introduced into the\ndiet of the infant when they are less than a year old. This can prompt celiac disease to first appear then\nor even decades later.\nThis is important! Tell every expectant mother not to feed her child grains until it is at least a year old.\nRemoving gluten from the diet of a celiac produces a marked change; whether an infant, child, or adult,\nthe person starts feeling better again. But he must not return to gluten foods.\nSome infants do not tolerate cow's milk protein, and react to it with celiac symptoms, even before gluten\nis given to them. So remove that also from them.\nCeliac disease is often misdiagnosed as spastic colon, irritable bowel syndrome, or something else which\naffects the intestines.\nYet, if left untreated, celiac disease can be quite serious. It can lead to pancreatic disease, infertility,\nmiscarriages, internal hemorrhaging, bone disease, gynecological disorders, nervous system damage,\nintestinal lymphoma, and many more. For example, anemia is common, due to poor absorption of folic\nacid, iron, and vitamins B and K.\n12\nScarring of the intestinal lining can progress so far that, by the age of 45 to 50, 90% of the intestine can\nbe damaged, resulting in a significant reduction (as much as 70%) of the absorptive surfaces.\nBut there is evidence that partial repair to those walls can be made within several months, if you\npermanently part company with the offending foods.",

Exercise must be diminished or, in grave cases,\nsuspended altogether. Moderate exercise may be allowed, if necessary, to maintain the appetite. Special\nattention must be given to increase of the appetite and improvement of digestion by suitable\nhydrotherapy applications. Cold applications must be very short and intense, so as to produce strong\nnervous impressions upon the nerve centers without removing animal heat, to any considerable degree,\nor increasing oxidation.\nPICA (craves dirt)\nSYMPTOMS—The child keeps eating dirt.\nCAUSES—Children eat dirt because they crave minerals which they are not obtaining enough of in the\nfoods served them. Sometimes they eat paint chips from the walls. But paint often contains lead or\ncadmium, both of which are quite toxic. Lead can produce brain damage. (See \"Lead Poisoning.\")\nTREATMENT—Supplement the child's diet with extra vitamins and minerals.\n- Include Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp in his diet. This will supply trace minerals.\nIf you live near the ocean, add a little ocean water to help salt the food. Do pulse tests to\ndetermine if a celiac type of disease exists (see \"Pulse Test,\" and \"Celiac Disease\").\n- Do a hair analysis test, to determine which minerals are needed.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The temptations of Satan are greater now than ever before; for he knows that\nhis time is short, and that very soon every case will be decided, either for life or for death.

In the East, where many subsist primarily on polished (hulled) rice,\nit is endemic. The rice bran contains the vitamins, and the polished kernel only contains starch and\nprotein.\nIn America, beriberi occurs as a result of alcoholism, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, infections, or stress.",

It is also consuming more\ncalories than you can use. All it takes is for you to be 20% overweight in order to be classified as obese.\nThe average human body has 30-40 million fat cells. That is too many for some of us. It has been said\nthat when a person makes an extra fat cell, in order to store some extra fat, he keeps that cell for the rest\nof his life—even though he may remove the fat from it.\nPoor diet, fatty foods, and a lack of exercise are common causes of overweight. Other factors include\ndiabetes, hypoglycemia, endocrine glands which do not function properly, boredom, tension, and love of\nfood. Another factor is inadequate intake or absorption of key nutrients, which causes fat to be stored\ninstead of used.\nOver $30 billion is spent each year, in America, on foods or equipment to help lose weight.\nObesity can be involved with hormonal imbalances in the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, thyroid,\nadrenals, or pancreas.\nObese people tend to store fat, not only in regular fat cells, but also in muscle tissue. Then, when they\ntry to lose weight (via a weight loss diet), they lose both fat from the fat cells and protein from the\nmuscles—before they lose fat from the muscles. The best solution is to keep fit, so you do not store fat\nin your muscle tissue.\nTo maintain weight loss (that is, an ongoing program of losing a little weight), calculate how many\ncalories you need each day. Multiply your weight by 10. Then add 30% (about a third) to the total.\nAssuming that you are moderately active, eating anything less than that total amount should cause you to\nlose weight. This total is the amount of calories you can consume daily, without gaining the weight back\nwhich you have already lost.\nIt is said that 90% of obese people overeat and binge because their empty calorie diets do not supply\nenough minerals (especially trace minerals) and vitamins.\nTREATMENT—People try to cut down on the calories, when they should make sure they steadily\nobtain good basic nutrition. Without adequate nourishment, they will generally binge or go off their\nspecial diets. It is now known that steady eating is better than losing weight, gaining it, losing it, and\ngaining it. The up and down program damages the body, and makes it more susceptible to disease. The\n14-year Framingham Study established that repeated crash diets increases the risk of heart disease.\n- Test for food allergies (see Pulse Test) and eliminate them.\n- Consistently eat a lighter, but more nourishing, diet. Do not eat food for fun; eat for\nhealth and to stay well.\n- Avoid junk food, fatty food, fried food, processed food, caffeine, nicotine, and soft\ndrinks,\n- Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day.\n- Do not skip meals. Make breakfast the largest, lunch a moderate meal, and supper the\nlightest.\n- Include Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp in your diet, to supply trace minerals.\n- When you end a meal, make it a habit to eat nothing more until your next meal.\n- Include a good vitamin-mineral supplement and fiber.\n- Go on a good basic diet and stay on it. Here is an example of one:\n- Eat moderate amounts of raw citrus and subacid fruits, but no sweet fruits, such as\ngrapes or dried fruits. No fruit juices, except diluted grape juice taken a half hour before\nthe meal, to reduce appetite. No bananas.\n- Eat as much raw vegetables as you want.\n- The only cooked vegetables should be fresh and conservatively cooked ones. Do not use\nfrozen, fried, or canned vegetables.\n- Primarily eat vegetarian protein foods, and in some moderation: beans, sprouted beans,\nseeds, nuts, etc.\n- All refined carbohydrates are forbidden. This includes sugar, alcohol, white-flour\nproducts, quick oats, most packaged cereals, and processed starch.\n- Eat only well-cooked, unrefined brown rice, barley, rye, millet, buckwheat, wheat\nberries, bulgur, corn, and other whole grains. Do not grind them, but cook and eat them in\ntheir natural state.\n- Use cold-pressed unsaturated oils, plus lemon juice, and possibly some herbs for\nflavoring.\n- Do not overeat, ever. It is a very, very bad habit to get into; it is a habit which can be\nstopped.\n- Do not eat between meals; that is another habit to quit.\n- When eating, concentrate on quietly eating and thinking about when you should stop. Do\nnot just relax, talk, socialize, and eat and eat. Do not listen to the radio, read a book, or\nwatch television. Stick to your work of eating lightly of nourishing food, and quit when\nyou should.\n- You will not be harmed by finishing the meal a little hungry.\n- A regular exercise program is needed.\nHere are still more helpful ideas:\n- Aerobic exercises are better than other kinds. This simply means exercise done out in the\nopen air. It helps lose weight; build strength; strengthen the heart, arteries, and veins; and\ninvigorate the vital organs and endocrine glands.\n- Walking uses up to 120 calories per hour while actual jogging burns only 440 calories\nper hour. Walking is always the best exercise.\n- Swimming is usually done in cold water, and this triggers the body to store extra fat as\nprotection against the cold. So swimming does not help one lose weight.\n- Children who are overweight by the age of 2 turn into fat adults more frequently than\nothers. Do not overfeed them with an excess of starches and cow's milk. Most infants\nreceive starches by four months, but that is far too early and only leads to later allergies or\nceliac disease (which see).\n- If you are only moderately overweight, do not worry about the comments of your thin\nfriends; they probably wish they could gain a little.\n—Also see \"Overweight—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Victories are not gained by ceremonies or display, but by simple obedience to\nthe highest General, the Lord God of heaven. He who trusts in this Leader will never know defeat.\nOVERWEIGHT—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nINCREASE OXIDATION OF HYDROCARBONS—Moderately prolonged cold baths, especially\nWet Sheet Pack, Shallow Bath, Cold Shower; Dripping Sheet Rub; Shallow Bath; Plunge Bath;\nmoderate exercise several times daily. The Cold Bath may be advantageously preceded by the Radiant\nHeat Bath or some other form of sweating bath that is not too prolonged. Exercise should always be\npreceded by a cold bath of sufficient duration to lower the temperature a few tenths of a degree.\nCARDIAC WEAKNESS—Cold Compress over the heart (except in fatty degeneration of the heart) 1530 minutes, 3 times daily; graduated exercises out-of-doors when possible.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid prolonged Hot Baths unless immediately followed by a cold bath.\nGENERAL METHOD—The general plan of treatment must be prolonged cold baths and vigorous\nexercise while reducing the daily ration of food to the lowest point consistent with the maintenance of\nhis strength. The treatment must never be conducted in such a way as to diminish his muscular or\nnervous energy. If he complains of feeling weak or debilitated, the vigor of the treatment must be\ndiminished. There should be a steady gain in muscular strength accompanying the loss of flesh. His\nstrength should be tested weekly. Do not use Hot Baths, for they are especially debilitating.\n—Also see \"Overweight—1.\"\nUNDERWEIGHT (Thinness)\nSYMPTOMS—The person weighs 10% less than an average person of his height and weight.\nSymptoms, when underweight, is a problem to be addressed. These symptoms include hunger, dizziness,\nfatigue, weakness, sensitivity to cold, and loss of ambition.\nCAUSES—Underweight is a problem for some, but not for others. Actually, as one ages, underweight\ncan be an advantage in a number of ways. If you are in good health, although underweight, there may be\nno need for concern to gain weight. Underweight people live longer and are in less danger from heart\ndisease.\nBut underweight may be associated with health problems; it should especially be a cause for concern if\nunintended, sudden weight loss has occurred.\nTry, if possible, to ascertain the cause of the weight loss or inability to gain weight. Here is a list of\nseveral possible causes:\nUnplanned-for weight loss can be caused by an inability by the gastro-intestinal tract to digest and\nabsorb food properly, resulting from ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, etc.\nIt can be caused by intestinal parasites or liver and pancreas problems.\nIt can be caused by digestive enzyme deficiency, allergy, or food sensitivity.\nIt can be caused by endocrine imbalances, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or (sometimes)\nhypothyroidism. If you are both underweight and feel cold all the time, you may be hypothyroid (which\nsee). Problems in the thyroid, pancreas, or adrenal glands can make weight gain impossible.\nHypoglycemics and diabetics have an especially hard time maintaining proper weight.\nIt can be caused by a chronic illness, surgery, stress, or emotional trauma (such as the death of a loved\none).\nIt can be caused by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, medicinal or street drugs, or AIDS.\nIn addition, there may be an eating disorder: The person eats too little (anorexia) or, in some cases, eats\ntoo much.\nZinc deficiency can reduce appetite, and so can some wasting diseases, such as cancer.\nThe consistency of the bowel movement and a check for undigested foods can be a valuable diagnostic\naid.\nThe experts tell us that, for adults, weight should not be gained at the rate of more than a pound a week.\nIn infants and children, the cause may be not enough food; in old people, it may result from disinterest in\neating or poverty.\nYou should especially be concerned about an infant or small child who suddenly seems to stop gaining\nweight normally. This may be caused by celiac disease (which see) or something else.",

      "overview": "Your body is having a hard time meeting the challenges of life, and needs help. The recommendations\nare simple enough:\n- Eat a nourishing diet, such as is outlined repeatedly in this book. For some people, it\nshould include more calories and protein than should normally be eaten. But for many\nwho are habitually underweight, the solution is to continue eating moderate-sized meals,\nbut eating only nourishing food (no junk or processed food). Adequate and complete\nproteins are essential.\n- Be sure and correct vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n- You may need to take digestive enzymes and/or supplemental hydrochloric acid (betaine\nHCl).\n- Obtain moderate out-of-door exercise each day. This will help your system digest the\nfood.\n- Obtain adequate rest at night, and try to lie down and rest 15, 30, or 60 minutes before\neach meal. This is important, and will strengthen your body for the challenge of coping\nsuccessfully with another meal.\n- Avoid stress of various kinds.\n- Eat in relaxed surroundings. Do not eat when you are nervous or upset.\n- Try to maintain regularity in all your habits and activities.\n- For infants, mashed bananas are more easily digested than some other foods.\n- There may be a food allergy, such as wheat, cow's milk, etc. (see Pulse Test).\n- It is vital that you not consume fried food, junk food, drink, and processed food. Avoid\ncaffeine, tobacco, and alcohol. If you are able to do so, do not take medicinal drugs.\n- Last but not least: If you are normally thin, but feel good, ignore the comments of others\nwho say you need to gain weight. Some of them wish they could be thinner.\nENCOURAGEMENT—If you will maintain a meek and quiet spirit, which is always obedient to God's\nWord, you will be spared many of the troubles which plague so many. Let Christ live in you and help\nothers through you.\nCELLULITE (Lumpy Fat)\nSYMPTOMS—Lumpy pockets of fat on the thighs, insides of upper arms, and gluteus maximus.\nCAUSES—With the passing of years, strands of fibrous tissue anchor to the skin. As they do this, they\npull the skin inward. This causes fat cells to push upward. Women especially tend to have this problem\nin the buttocks, hips, and thighs.\nThere is no known cure, but there are suggestions you may wish to try:\nTREATMENT—Lose weight. This will help reduce the protruding pockets of fat.\n- Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. These are both nourishing and lower in calories.\nImprove your general pattern of diet and take vitamin/mineral supplements.\n- Keep the channels of elimination open, so excess fluids and fat can be more easily\neliminated. Only use a very small amount of salt, drink plenty of water, keep the bowels\nopen, maintain regularity, and avoid constipation.\n- Do not use caffeine or tobacco. Both constrict your blood vessels and make the cellulite\nmore prominent.\n- Do muscle-toning exercises.\n- Make sure you are obtaining adequate rest.\n- Exercise out-of-doors and breathe deeply. The oxygen helps burn fat; and the better\nventilation helps empty carbon dioxide from body cells.\n- To whatever degree you can, avoid stress, tension, and time schedules. Cellulite builds\nup when muscles become tense, and muscles tense when you are agitated.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord has honored us by choosing us as His soldiers. Let us fight bravely\nfor Him, maintaining the right in every transaction. Stand for the right though the heavens fall. God will\nhelp you.\nSection 6\nUrinary\nPart 1\nUrine",

Drink 2 quarts a day of 50-50 orange juice and water.\n- Alternate method: Take a hot sitz bath repeatedly, followed by a short cold bath. If\nbedridden, apply hot, followed by short cold, over bladder, genital area, and entire length\nof spine.\n- Give a high enema of catnip tea. This is important in helping the urine to again begin\nflowing.\n- Drink more water and take herbs which increase urine flow. Corn-silk tea is the best;\nothers include juniper berries, carrot tops, comfrey, plantain, cleavers, chickweed.\n- Insert a soft catheter and draw out the urine. Steep the following in a quart of boiling\nwater: 1 tsp. goldenseal and a half tsp. each of boric acid and myrrh. Strain through a fine\ncloth, and inject through a fountain syringe. Retain as long as possible. You can moisten\nthe tip with slippery elm tea.

Blood in the urine shows a smoky sediment, and is reddish\nbrown. Urine may be slightly smoky, reddish, or very red.\nCAUSES—Red, or reddish, urine may be due to blood in the urine, known as hematuria, and to senna or\nrhubarb, which may color the urine either brown or orange.\nIf the blood is well-mixed with the urine, it is probably from the kidneys. If it is clotted in tubular casts\nof ureters, it is from kidneys or ureters. If its is passed at the beginning of urination, it is from the\nurethra; if at the end, it is from the bladder.\nBleeding from the kidneys produces smoky urine, which may be bright red. Bleeding from the urethra is\nalways bright red, and precedes urination. Bleeding from the urine vesicle produces bright red urine,\nwhich is not uniform.\nOther causes of blood in urine can be a lesion of the urinary tract, contamination during menstruation,\nprostatic disease, tumors, poisoning (especially carbolic acid and cantharides), malaria, toxemias, and\ncalculus (kidney stones).",

These include:\nRenal tubular acidosis: The kidneys fail to reabsorb bicarbonate properly, resulting in inadequate\nammonia production and acid excretion. This leads to a severe lack of fluid and potassium in the body,\nand an excess of acidity. The bones can become deranged.\nHydronephrosis: The kidneys and bladder become filled with urine, due to obstruction of the flow.\nGlomerulonephritis: This is an inflammation of the tiny kidney filtering units, sometimes resulting from\na bacterial infection in the body.\nUremia: A toxic waste buildup in the blood, due to kidney malfunction.\nIn all of these conditions, a basic need is to cleanse the kidneys, increase urine flow, and restore proper\nfunction.",

      "overview": "- Eat 75% raw foods, including garlic, parsley, potatoes, celery, cucumbers, and bananas.\nGreen vegetables are especially important.\n- Stop eating meat. An excess of protein is part of your problem; and meat also has a\nvariety of waste products, plus bacteria, purines, and uric acid.\n- Avoid dairy products, except yogurt. Do not eat chocolate or cocoa.\n- Drink 6-8 ounces of distilled water every hour.\n- Watermelon and pumpkin seeds seem to help the kidneys, although the reason is not\nknown.\n- Corn-silk tea is the best single herb for increasing urine flow and restoring the kidneys.\nWatermelon-seed tea and celery and parsley seeds are also diuretic in function.\n- Cranberries help acidify the urine, destroy bacteria, and restore the bladder.\n- Do not eat much potassium or phosphorous. For this reason, avoid beet greens, spinach,\nrhubarb, and Swiss chard.\n- Lead, other metals, the pain relieving drugs (Advil, Nuprin, etc.), and infectious diseases\n(scarlet fever, measles, etc.) can damage the kidneys. Spirulina is known to reduce kidney\npoisoning that is caused by mercury and drugs.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Only to those who receive Christ as their Saviour is given the power to\nbecome sons and daughters of God. The sinner cannot, by any power of his own, rid himself of sin. But\nChrist can give the needed strength to come off victor in the battle with Satan.\nKIDNEY STONES—1 (Nephrocalcinosis)\nSYMPTOMS—Intermittent, dull, dragging pain radiating from the upper back to the lower abdomen,\nusually increased by motion.\nThere is bleeding and renal colic (strong kidney pain) when the stone enters the ureters. These sharp\npains may last hours or days. There is increased urination with pus and blood, pallor, nausea, and\nvomiting. Sometimes there are fever and chills.\nWhen you have bloody urine and sharp pain in the bladder or kidneys, it is very likely kidney stones.\nCAUSES—Kidney stones (also called bladder stones or cystic calculi) are an abnormal accumulations\nof mineral salts. They form in the kidneys and, during passage down the ureters, may lodge in them or in\nthe bladder. The stones are primarily composed of calcium oxalate; but urates, phosphates, and cystine\nmay also be present.\nOddly enough, a key factor in the production of kidney stones is a calcium and/or magnesium\ndeficiency. The minerals in the stones come from your own bones!\nRefined carbohydrates, especially sugar, prompts kidney stone formation. The sugar increases in the\npancreas and excretes additional insulin, which in turn causes the kidneys to discharge more calcium in\nthe urine.\nCalcium is needed by the body. If not enough calcium is in the diet, the parathyroids will signal the body\nto extract calcium from the bones in order to keep the blood calcium level at normal levels.\nA vitamin B and magnesium deficiency may also cause stone formation. A Swedish research group\n6\nfound that taking both daily stopped stone formation in 90% of their patients. Magnesium, like calcium,\ncan bond with the oxalate. B (10 mg a day) lowers the amount of oxalate in the urine.\n6\nIn response to lowered blood calcium levels, the parathyroids trigger the body to draw it out of the\nbones.\nIt is vital that you obtain a balanced diet of vitamins and minerals every day.\nPartial causes of kidney stone formation can include dehydration (not drinking enough water),\ninfections, prolonged periods of rest in bed, and only rarely taking vitamin D and calcium.\nToo much food, including acid-forming foods—especially meat, along with white-flour products, sugar\nfoods, tea, coffee, spices, and vinegar—all help produce an excess of waste in the kidneys. Eventually it\naccumulates into gravel and stones.",

      "overview": "- It is vital that you increase the amount of water you drink! Kidney health is keyed to an\nadequate fluid level in the blood. Only use distilled water.\n- Used in conjunction with more fluid intake, corn-silk tea increases urine output, a very\nnecessary factor in purifying and detoxifying the kidneys.\n- Watermelon provides additional water. Eat it alone and often, but do not eat it with other\nfoods during meals.\n- A lack of vitamin A can lead to stone formation. It helps protect the lining of the urinary\ntract.\n- A more acid urine prevents and dissolves kidney stones. Drink cranberry juice\nfrequently. (One writer says that Ocean Spray brand is only 30% cranberry juice, plus\nsugar, etc.) All other fruit juices become alkaline in the system. Do not put vinegar into\nthe body.\n- Eat potassium broth. This is made from thick potato peelings. Cook it with carrots,\ngarlic, and celery. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, then strain and drink the liquid. Excess can\nbe stored in the refrigerator for no more than 2 days.\n- Oxalate, a key chemical in kidney stone formation, occurs naturally in various green\nvegetables; some more than others. Rhubarb has the highest oxalic acid content of\nanything eaten by man. Also do not eat spinach, chard, or beet tops. About 60% of all\nstones are calcium oxalate in nature.\n- Drink watermelon-seed tea; steep in hot water for 15 minutes, strain, add a little honey\nand drink.\n- There may be an excess of purines. Stop eating meat. Meat-based proteins are a causal\nfactor in producing kidney stones. Do not overeat on other proteins.\n- Do not use soft drinks, caffeine, chocolate, cocoa, pepper, nuts, poppy seeds, or black\ntea.\n- Reduce salt intake.\n- A strict macrobiotic diet (lots of grains and little fruits and vegetables) tends to\nconcentrate the urine and may cause stones. But this is not a primary cause of them.\n- Take licorice, to reduce swelling of the ureters, so the stone can pass. Calcium and\nmagnesium are crucial to stop the calcium loss from the bones. Eat less meat to get your\ncalcium/phosphorous ratio in order (meat is full of phosphorous).\n- The following herbs are helpful: dandelion, rupturewort, and madder.\n- To dissolve kidney stones, drink hot water and lemon juice.

Severe cases may include anemia and high blood pressure.\nCAUSES—This is inflammation of one or both kidneys. Thousands of tiny cells in the kidneys filter\nfluids out of the blood in order to purify it. But the filter can become plugged with toxins and mucous.\nWhen these tiny cells become swollen and inflamed, infection soon follows.\nThis infection can be acute or chronic, and may require hospitalization.\nConstipation causes a toxic matter to be reabsorbed by the blood. This clogs the kidneys.\nOveruse of aspirin and other pain killers weaken the kidneys; beer can cause their failure. Environmental\ntoxins, such as heavy metals, add to the damage. Anti-hypertensive drugs are used to reduce blood\ncirculation, and therefore injure the kidneys.\nKidney infection can also be caused by bacterial infection in the bladder (cystitis, which see) which has\ntraveled up the ureters to the kidneys.",

This is a jet or spray directed upward, in this case, against the\nperineum (p. 159). Abdominal Douche (a spray to the front of the abdomen only (p. 165).\nBladder inflammation: Copious water drinking. Revulsive Sitz Bath, twice a day; Hot Leg Packs,\nfollowed by dry heat (Radiant Heat Bath) to legs; Neutral Bath 20-40 minutes, 2-3 times a week;\nProlonged Neutral Sitz Bath; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub; Fomentation over bladder, Hot\nEnema; Hot Pelvic Pack; Aseptic Dietary (p. 180).\nIrritable bladder: When inflammation is not present, give a Very Hot Sitz Bath for 5 minutes, followed\nby Neutral Sitz Bath for 10-20 minutes. Hot pack to pelvis, Heating Compress over perineum and\ngenitals, Revulsive Sitz, and Hot Colonic (p. 180).\nBladder insufficiency: Spinal (Dorsal) Douche. This is a hand-held hosing of water to the dorsal (upper\nand central) part of the spine. The stream should be allowed to play rapidly up and down, extending 3-4\ninches on either side of the spine. Give tepid water for irritability of the bladder (when of spinal origin).\nGive a Cold Spinal Douche for motor insufficiency of the bladder, resulting in urinary incontinence or\nretention (p. 160).\nBladder paresis (paralysis): Daily colonic. Cold Plantar Douche, that is, to bottom of feet (p. 219).\nBladder retention: Lumbar Revulsive Douche.

Urine\noften has a strong, unpleasant odor and may appear cloudy (from pus). A desire to urinate even after the\nbladder has been emptied.\nChildren with this condition may experience a painful burning sensation when urinating.\nCAUSES—Cystitis is an infection of the urinary bladder. It is the most frequent bacterial infection in\nwomen. About 10-15% of them have recurrent bladder infections.\nThe cause is generally bacteria which have ascended up from the urinary opening, but, less frequently,\nfrom infected urine sent down from the kidneys.\nThe usual cause is ascended bacteria, and cystitis most often occurs in females. The urinary outlet of the\nurethra is close to the vagina. Ways to avoid cross infection between the two are given in the concluding\nparagraph of this article.\nFrequency, urgency, and burning urine are obvious symptoms of cystitis, but a home test can be also be\ndone: Purchase \"Dipstick\" at a pharmacy and follow directions. A positive nitrate test will reveal the\npresence of a large quantity of white blood cells, indicating infection in the urinary tract.\nWomen who frequently have bladder infections often have enlarged bladders from having tried to retain\ntheir urine. In order to maintain good urinary tract health, it is important to drink water and urinate\nfrequently.\nIn older men, the cause of the bladder problem might be kidney stones (which see).\nBlood in the urine could indicate a more serious problem. Consult a physician. (Also see \"Hematuria\").\nBladder infection in men may signal prostate trouble.\nCyclamate (an artificial sweetener found in synthetic sugar) causes bladder tumors.",

The next day, add 2 cloves\ncrushed garlic or garlic juice to the water of one of the two baths.\n- A hot water bottle placed in direct contact to the urethral and vaginal openings may be\nextremely helpful in reducing pain. A heat lamp can also be used.\n- Women should especially avoid bacterial infection ascending into the bladder: The\nurinary outlet of the urethra is close to the vagina. When sexual intercourse is not done\nwith clean hands or too frequently, germs are more likely to enter the urethra. Wipe from\nfront to back following bowel movements, urinate before and after intercourse, and wear\ncotton underclothing (it lets air through and absorbs moisture better). Avoid douches,\nhygiene sprays, bubble baths, soap in the bath water, and nylon clothing. Wash carefully\nduring the monthly, to avoid bacteria from going up the urethra. Do not use tampons if\nthere are frequent urinary tract infections. Rinse underwear well, to get all the soap out.\nBoil panties in plain water. Shower after bathing in a swimming pool. Dress to keep the\nextremities warm; cold extremities weaken the trunk organs, including the urinary tract.\nBirth control pills and spermaticides may cause cystitis.\n—See \"Cystitis—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ was lifted upon the cross of Calvary, to draw all men unto Himself.\nWhat shall we do then with Jesus? Shall we accept Him or reject Him? But more: How shall we treat\nHis purchased possessions, those around us? Will we do all we can to help them?\nCYSTITIS—2; and Irritable Bladder (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nINFLAMMATION—Copious water drinking; Revulsive Sitz Bath, twice a day; Hot Leg Packs\nfollowed by dry heat (Radiant Heat bath) to legs; Neutral Bath for 20-40 minutes, 2-3 times a week;\nprolonged Neutral Sitz Bath; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub; Fomentation over bladder; Hot\nEnema; Hot Pelvic Pack; Aseptic Dietary.\nIRRITABLE BLADDER—With inflammation not present: Very Hot Sitz Bath for 5 minutes, followed\nby Neutral Sitz Bath for 10-20 minutes. Hot Pack to pelvis, Heating Compress over perineum and\ngenitals, Revulsive Sitz, Hot Colonic.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—Do not apply Cold Sitz Bath, Cold Full Bath, Cold Douche, or Cold\nFootBath.\n—See \"Cystitis—1.\"\nEDEMA (Dropsy)\nSYMPTOMS—Swelling of the hands, ankles, feet, face, abdomen, or other areas of the body. Swelling\nis most often seen in the hands, in the feet, or around the eyes. The bloating or swelling causes muscle\naches and pains.\nCAUSES—Edema is a fluid accumulation in the body. It can be caused by poor kidney function,\nchronic kidney disease, congestive heart disease, varicose veins, phlebitis, protein or thiamine\ndeficiency, sodium retention, or cancer.\nOther causal factors include pregnancy, standing for long periods of time; premenstrual tension; the use\nof oral contraceptives; a confining injury, such as a sprain, allergic reactions, or a bee sting.\nWhen the skin indents, forming little pits, when the skin of the feet or ankles is pressed by a finger, the\nsituation is worsening. Contact a physician.\nFluid retention is sometimes caused by a food allergy. Hypothyroidism, anemia, adrenal malfunction,\nconstipation, and lack of exercise can be causal factors, along with deficiencies of potassium, vitamin B\ncomplex, or vitamins B , B , or B .\n1 3 6\nAs soon as edema is found to exist, it is well to obtain a clear diagnosis. Once congestive heart disease,\nkidney disease, or liver disease are ruled out, more subtle causes can be dealt with more easily.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Difficult breathing, coughing, wheezing, tight chest. Attacks of multiple symptoms can\noccur suddenly or gradually. Sometimes there is coughing with thick, persistent sputum that may be\nclear or yellow. There is a feeling of suffocation.\nCAUSES—Asthma is a lung disease that results in blockage of the airways. During an asthma attack,\nthe muscles around the bronchi (which are the small passageways of the lungs) tighten and narrow,\nmaking it difficult for air to leave the lungs.\nThe chronic inflammation and excessive sensitivity of the bronchi produce those constricting spasms.\nThe bronchial tubes swell and become plugged with mucous. An attack, often occurring at night, usually\nbegins as a nonproductive cough and wheezing, which is often followed by difficult breathing and a\ntight chest. After a few hours it subsides.\nBut what causes an attack to come on? Only certain people have asthma, and those that do may have an\nattack triggered by an allergen or other irritant, such as chemicals, drugs, dust mites, feathers, food\nadditives, pollutants, fumes, mold, animal dander, tobacco smoke, etc. But other things can also do it:\nanxiety, fear, laughing, stress, low blood sugar, adrenal disorders, temperature changes, extremes of\ndryness or humidity, or respiratory infections.\nAbout 80% have an allergic disorder, but the others do not. The experts warn that ever-increasing\namounts of pollutants will cause the number of asthmatics to increase. Many workers must continually\nlive with such things as sulfites, urethane, polyurethane, epoxy resins, dry cleaning chemicals, and many\nother chemicals common to industry. In the last decade alone, the number of asthmatics in America has\nincreased by one third! Children under 16 and adults over 65 suffer the most from it.\nAsthmatics are frequently very sensitive to foods containing sulfite additives: potassium metabisulfite,\nsulfur dioxide, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, etc. Restaurants use them, to prevent discoloration\nin salads and other foods. Sulfites are also added to many other foods by the food industry.\nNitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide, and cigarette\nsmoke are also known to precipitate asthma attacks.\nFumes and strong odors, such as turpentine, paints, gasoline, perfumes, etc., disturb many asthmatics.\nThere are two types of asthma: intrinsic and extrinsic.\nExtrinsic asthma usually begins in childhood, is seasonal, and is usually caused by a definite number of\nsubstances which can more easily be identified. Asthma is the leading cause of disease and disability in\nthe 2-17 age group.\nIntrinsic asthma is the more severe, and generally begins after 30 years of age. Attacks can occur at any\ntime, and the causes are much more difficult to identify.\nAbout half of asthmatics are diagnosed between 2 and 17, another third after 30. The other one sixth\ndoes not fit either the intrinsic or extrinsic category. For example, some may initiate the problem in their\n20s and others may, after their 30s, develop reactions to only one or two seasonal allergens.\nBut asthma can be difficult to diagnose, for its symptoms are similar to those of bronchitis, emphysema,\nand lung infections.\nOver a period of time, the attacks can become more frequent, so it is best for the person with asthma to\nlearn every possible way to lessen the problem.

Keep the head cool by sponging with cool water or use a fan.\n- Pouring cold water on the back of the neck is useful. As the person bends over, the water\nis poured on the back of the neck from a container holding about a gallon of water. From\nabout 24 inches above the neck, pour it for about 30-90 seconds. Do this 3 times a day\nduring the critical phase.\n- A vaporizer, which blows cold, moist air is helpful during an attack. Menthol or\neucalyptus oil may be added to the water.\n- After blending a clove of garlic in a cup of water, drink it. This may be vomited back\nout, loosening the phlegm. If vomited, give another cup. The garlic really helps.\n- Some take a cup of hot water, catnip tea, or mullein tea each hour.\n- At the first sign of an asthmatic attack, sit up straight in a chair for the first 10 minutes.\nInhale through your nose and exhale through pursed lips. This helps press open the\nbronchial tubes.\n- Then lie on your stomach, with your head and chest over the edge of the bed. Cough\ngently for 2-3 minutes, to bring up the sputum. (But, during an attack, some cannot\ntolerate this position; instead, they lie face down on the bed with 2-3 pillows under their\nhips and a towel under their face.)\n- A neutral bath (94o-98o F.) is quieting to the nerves and helps relax them.\n- Lobelia is an herb that, when sipped slowly, relaxes the nerves and tends to stop the\nspasm. (If one drinks more quickly, it has a different effect, and induces vomiting.)\n- Mullein oil is a worthwhile remedy for bronchial congestion. The oil stops coughs\nbecause it unclogs bronchial tubes. When taken with water or fruit juice, the effect is even\nmore rapid.\n- Other useful herb teas include juniper berries, echinacea, and, of course, that old\nstandby, slippery elm bark.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Coughing and mucous, pain in the chest (and possibly back), fever, sore throat, and\ndifficult breathing. Sudden chills and shaking may occur.\nCAUSES—The bronchial tubes are the airways which lead into the lungs. The bronchi are two main\nbranches of the trachea. They divide into many smaller bronchi, like tree roots. These, in turn, divide off\ninto the grape-like maze, called the lungs.\nBronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi, and is frequently complicated by mucous obstruction of those\npassageways. When the bronchi are badly infected, the cause is often viral rather than bacterial.\nIrritating substances (or invading bacteria or viruses) cause the bronchi to produce an excess of mucous,\nwhich clogs the airways.\nThere are two types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. The acute very often occurs as infection in throat\nmoves on down toward the lungs. A cold or the flu, if not immediately given careful treatment, can\nspread into other areas, such as the bronchi or the eustachian tubes. If bronchitis is not carefully dealt\nwith, the infection will move on into the lungs, resulting in pneumonia.\nChronic bronchitis is an ongoing problem, which results from repeated bouts of acute bronchitis or from\nsomething that is frequently irritating the lungs. This can be allergies, especially tobacco smoke. The\nonly ones who gain from tobacco are the manufacturers. Interestingly enough, only 9% of bronchitis\npatients in the U.S. are non-smokers. Infants exposed to cigarette smoke are far more likely to come\ndown with bronchitis.\nChronic bronchitis reduces the amount of oxygen to the lungs and the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled.\nThis eventually can lead to enlargement of the heart; pulmonary hypertension; and finally, heart failure.",

      "overview": "- Stop smoking and get tobacco out of the house. If you have chronic bronchitis, do not\nexpect much improvement as long as tobacco smoke is in the home.\n- Do not use milk; it produces a thick phlegm which complicates healing. White-flour\nproducts and sugar foods should not be used until bronchitis is past.\n- Drink plenty of fluids: pure water, soups, and herb teas. Vitamin C is important! Take it\nto bowel tolerance.\n- Anise tea and almond milk are helpful in bronchitis. Make the almond milk by blending\n6 tbsp. of almonds in a pint of water.\n- Cayenne and lobelia will help break up the congestion.\n- Add moisture to the air with a vaporizer or humidifier or heat a pan of water on the\nstove.\n- Remain in bed as long as fever is present. Bronchitis often hangs on because people\nthink it is about over and begin going about their everyday duties. Go to bed and get well.\n- Deep breathing exercises should be taken 3-4 times a day. Take a deep breath, hold it a\nfew seconds, and exhale. Do this 10-20 times. This will help air out of the infected area.\n- Breathe deep. Blow up a balloon several times every day. This helps open up and\nenlarge the airways.\n- Apply a heating compress at night.\n- A hot footbath will help pull the blood away from the chest and reduce congestion.\n- Hot drinks help you cough out the phlegm. Coughing is the only way the phlegm can\ncome out. Do not use cough suppressants while you have bronchitis.\n- Apply warm, moist heat or a hot water bottle over the chest and back before bedtime.\nThis will help relieve congestion and aid in sleep.\n- Avoid fatigue and chilling. Do not walk barefoot on cold floors while you are trying to\nget well.\n- If the coughing gets worse, there is a high fever, wheezing sounds, lethargy, and\nweakness. Chest pains develop and very difficult breathing. Contact a health professional;\nthe condition may be developing into pneumonia.\n- If the condition persists over too long a time, there is the possibility of tuberculosis or\nlung cancer.\n- A professional can use bronchoscopy instruments to examine the bronchial tubes and\nsuction out phlegm.\n- In recent years, a new type of bronchitis has arisen, which is contracted primarily by\nwomen. Difficult to treat, it often continues for 3 weeks to 5 months. Drinking goldenseal\ntea is helpful with this condition, as well as with other types of bronchitis.\n- Other helpful herbs include pau d'arco, chickweed, ginkgo biloba, burdock, lobelia,\nslippery elm bark, echinacea, and wild cherry bark.\n—Also see \"Bronchitis—2\" and \"Bronchiectasis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Christ determined, in council with His Father, to spare nothing, however\ncostly, that would rescue the poor sinner. He did all this for you. Kneel down and accept Him anew just\nnow. Give Him your life and, by His enabling grace, obey His Ten Commandment law.\nBRONCHITIS—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)",

Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nACTIVE CONGESTION—Fomentation to back; Cold Compress to chest with Hot Leg Pack, followed\nby Cold Mitten Friction and dry heat to legs; short cold applications to hands and arms, followed by Hot\nPacks to arms; Revulsive Douche to legs; Hot Leg Bath with very Cold Compress to the chest and to the\nback opposite the chest. Change compress as soon as it is warmed.\nPASSIVE CONGESTION OF CHEST—Apply Fomentation over chest for 10 minutes every hour;\nduring the interval between, apply a Cold Compress, renewing it every 15 minutes, rubbing surface well\nat each change. This condition most frequently occurs in fevers. Prevent it by frequent change of his\nposition. Apply same derivative measures as for active congestion (see just above).\nPULMONARY HEMORRHAGE—Ice Pack to chest; remove and rub the chest with dry warm\nflannel, 1-2 minutes every 15 minutes; Hot Leg Pack, very Hot Sponging of the upper half of the spine.\nPlace hands in ice water for 1-2 minutes; maintain skin circulation by dry rubbing. Keep him very quiet.\nAfter hemorrhage ceases, graduated cold treatment to increase resistance and combat the disease causing\nthe hemorrhage.

The viral form is more variable in seriousness,\nfrom the time it begins.\nCAUSES—Pneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs and bronchial tubes. It can be caused by\nbacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa. The tiny sacs in the lungs (which look somewhat like grapes\nhanging from their stems) are where the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange is made. These sacs\nbecome inflamed and filled with mucous and pus.\nGenerally an upper respiratory infection (in the throat and the bronchial tubes), such as a cold, the flu, or\nperhaps the measles, occurs. Those under one year or over 60 are the most susceptible.\nBacterial pneumonia is more dangerous and severe than the viral type. There is also a fungal pneumonia,\nbut those with HIV are most likely to contract it.\nIn children, the pain of pneumonia is frequently located in the abdomen, and cause others to think there\nis acute indigestion or appendicitis.",

The sharp chest pain one may feel might\nbe the pleurisy (which see)\nIt is spread by coughing. Tiny droplets are inhaled by others. The germ enters the lungs and remains\nthere. As long as the person maintains a healthy lifestyle, the body encapsulates the germs; that is, a tiny\ncalcium shell is placed around the TB germ, to render it harmless.\nIf the person continues to eat right, get enough calcium in his diet, obtain adequate rest, exercise out-ofdoors, and breathe vigorously to keep his lungs in good health—he will not develop TB, even though the\ngerms are in his lungs.",

    "fields": {
      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—It is only with great effort that the person can exhale air from his lungs. There is\ncontinual breathlessness. Most any exertion brings coughing. It is hard to breathe in, but worse to\nbreathe out. The neck veins often stand out from the effort, and he breathes through the mouth in order\nto try to get enough air in and out. Breathing is usually rapid and short. He may breathe 25-30 times a\nminute, and still not get enough air.\nEventually his chest becomes barrel-shaped, his face ruddy, and he speaks with short, broken phrases.\nCAUSES—The word, \"emphysema,\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"to puff up with air.\" The\nwalls of the lungs lose their elasticity, so air cannot be easily pushed in and out, as should normally\nhappen. So there is air in the lungs, but it is not moving in and out. As emphysema progresses and there\nis more obstruction to airflow, the lungs enlarge with trapped air.\nThe most frequent cause is smoking, but air pollution also receives some of the blame. Live in the\ncountry and do not have tobacco in your home, and you should be able to avoid this problem.\nEmphysema has become the most common modern lung infection in the Western world. Needing a\ncontinual exchange of air to survive, we use about a thousand cubic feet of air each day. It passes over\nlung surfaces which, if laid flat, would be as large as a tennis court. In emphysema, a large portion of the\nalveoli (the grape-like sacs where the air exchange occurs) are destroyed, and the blood is not properly\naerated.",

      "overview": "- The person absolutely must stop smoking. Tobacco smoke should be banished from the\nhome, car, and place of work. Also avoid hair spray and other sprays.\n- Avoid allergens that you know of.\n- Maintain a program of regular exercise. Walking out-of-doors is always the best. Try\nusing 1- or 2-pound hand weights and work the muscles in the neck, upper shoulders, and\nchest. Those with chronic emphysema need strong muscles there more than others do.\n- Eat less and a little more often. Prolonged digestion requires more oxygen and blood to\nthe stomach, and away from other parts of the body which also need them.\n- Avoid gas-forming foods, such as legumes and cabbage. These cause abdominal\ndistention which can interfere with breathing.\n- Sip warm, clear liquids in the morning (such as herb teas), to help clear mucous from the\nairways.\n- Excessively hot or cold foods may induce coughing.\n- Avoid hard-to-chew foods and maintain a low- salt diet.\n- Do not eat when emotionally upset or angry.\n- Drink enough water. The fluid intake is needed to keep the mucous, in the lungs, thin.\n- Maintain your ideal body weight. Some of those with this problem tend to put on weight\nand retain fluid. The closer you are to your ideal weight, the better for your lungs. Stay on\na low-calorie diet. The thinner you are, the less flesh your lungs have to supply oxygen to.\n- Obesity and constipation decrease the patient's resistance to respiratory infection.\n- Keep your clothing loose; this helps you breathe better.\n- Learn to breathe correctly. The tendency is to breathe short and fast. But make yourself\nbreathe steadily, from the diaphragm. Strengthen your respiration muscles by blowing out\nslowly through pursed lips for 30 minutes a day. Try to exhale twice as long as it took you\nto breathe in.\n- Learn to cough properly. Inhale slowly and deeply, exhale through pursed lips, and\ncough in short huffing bursts rather than vigorously.\n- Pace yourself in your work. Work steadily; it is not necessary to work fast.\n- When working, lift while you exhale through pursed lips; inhale while you rest. When\nclimbing steps, climb while exhaling; inhale when you stop to rest.\n- Go through the day relaxed, not with a sense of alarm over your air problems.\n- Avoid contact with anyone with a respiratory infection.\n- Avoid drugs which suppress coughs. They dry up secretions, which you do not want.\n- Use only essential and unscented soaps. Avoid perfumes, gas stoves, carpeting, curtains\nand draperies which cannot easily be cleaned. Avoid hot, humid climates. Avoid furry,\nfeathered animals in your home.\n- Get plenty of fresh air. Use a warm scarf or mask over the mouth and nose when\noutdoors in cold weather. Keep the body warm at all times.\n- Place 3, 4, or 5-inch blocks under the foot of the bed. This will help prevent mucous\nfrom accumulating in the lower part of the lungs during the night. (But not too steep, for\nthat would be hard on the heart.)",

It is difficult to find remedial\nsolutions, but here is one:\nSeveral years ago, a Christian mother visited her neighbors, and met a woman with emphysema. It was a\nsmall, stuffy house and the lady smoked. So the mother went back home and eventually found a\ntreatment; it was a wet heating pack from Kneipp's book, written nearly two centuries ago. She gave the\ntreatment to the woman, who got well within several weeks. This was the treatment:\n- Place a plastic sheet on the bed, both above the bottom sheet and beneath the top sheet\nand covers. Dip another sheet in very cold water, and wring it out somewhat—quickly, to\nkeep in the cold.\n- Work quickly: Wrap the sheet about the person, who is standing unclothed. The sheet\ncovers everything but the head and perhaps part of the neck. Than wrap a dry blanket\naround him. The person immediately gets into the bed, and is covered well with the top\nsheet and blankets. This is essentially something like a heating pack, but done only with a\nwet sheet. The effect is immediate freezing cold, which the body gradually warms. The\nperson can remain like this all night.\nIn the years that followed, the mother mentioned the incident to a number of medical people and doctors,\nwho were astounded; for everyone says there is no cure for emphysema.\nENCOURAGEMENT—By both creation and redemption we are the Lord's property. We are required\nto obey His laws, but we are never asked to do it in our own strength. Christ helps us in all that we do.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—The pleural membranes become swollen and inflamed, and at first rub together with\neach breath, causing severe pain and sound that can be heard by a physician using his stethoscope. The\npain becomes suddenly more severe if the person attempts to take a quick deep breath, to cough, or\nsneeze.\nFluid may form in the space between the lung and the chest wall. When that happens, the rubbing sound\ndisappears, as well as most, or all, of the pain. There may only be a little fluid or it may fill half the chest\ncavity, compressing the lung.\nPleurisy can also appear on the surface of the diaphragm. In this case, the pain is in the abdomen, at the\npit of the stomach, or can even be referred pain to the shoulder.\nIn children, pleurisy pain and the pain of pneumonia are frequently located in the abdomen, and cause\nothers to think there is acute indigestion or appendicitis.\nCAUSES—The lungs are enclosed within a sack-like covering. Since the lungs are constantly in\nmotion, they must be able to slip against this covering without harming themselves or the pleura.\nPleurisy occurs when this sack becomes inflamed. The cause is generally the tubercle bacillus (the cause\nof tuberculosis), pneumococcus, or streptococcus; the two later germs are present in pneumonia.\nSome pleurisy is always present in lobar pneumonia (see pneumonia); and, in adults, pleurisy is\nfrequently a complication of tuberculosis (which see).\nBut the underlying cause is not taking care of oneself: not eating right, not getting enough sleep, or not\navoiding stress and overwork.",

A powerful pain is\nproduced, which may last for several minutes, often extending to the shoulder, arm, neck, or jaw.\nBut it may be a small attack, producing relatively little discomfort. Sometimes it is mistaken as\nindigestion. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all. This is termed a \"silent heart attack.\"\nAn angina shows itself as recurrent pain beneath the sternum, and lasts 30-60 seconds.\nSYMPTOMS OF HEART FAILURE—Shortness of breath, poor color, fatigue, accumulation of\nfluids, especially around the ankles (edema).\nHEART ATTACK—What is a heart attack? What leads up to it? This article will provide you with an\noverview of the problem, along with several specific suggestions.\nThe cardiovascular system is the heart, a blood pump. The blood is sent through arteries and veins,\nthroughout the body.\nCardiovascular disease is the name given to several problems which can stop the heart and cause death.\n1 - A coronary is one type of cardiovascular disease. The arteries which nourish the heart\nmuscle itself are the coronary arteries. But if these arteries become narrowed, not enough\noxygen and nutrients are supplied to the heart, and not enough carbon dioxide and waste\nproducts are carried off. This oxygen deprivation causes a tight, heavy chest pain, usually\nfollowing some exertion or after a meal. There is a sharp, debilitating pain in the center of\nthe chest. It is called angina pectoris (or simply angina). The pain generally recedes when\nthe person rests. But it is a forewarning of events to come.\nAn angina may be precipitated by stress, exertion, a large meal, extreme cold, emotion, or\nother factors. Average life expectancy after the first onset of angina is 5-7 years.\n2 - If that blood flow through the coronaries becomes entirely blocked or limited enough,\nso that it does not reach part of the heart, then a heart attack or myocardial infarction\noccurs. This refers to the formation of infarcts (areas of local tissue decay or death) in the\nmyocardium (heart muscle). A heart attack does not always kill. But, whether it is mild or\nsevere, a heart attack always produces some irreparable damage to the heart.\n3 - The problem may not be in the heart, but in the arteries which nourish it. The arteries\nhave hardened (called arteriosclerosis), and when cholesterol and other materials flows\nthrough them, a clot (also called a thrombus) occurs. The hardened walls do not flex to let\nthe blob pass on through. Arteriosclerosis is responsible for most of the deaths due to\nheart attack.\n4 - Lack of oxygen and nutrients can also cause spasm of the coronary arteries, resulting\nin a heart attack.\n5 - Then there is high blood pressure (called hypertension). This is another form of\ncardiovascular disease, which also prepares the way for a heart attack. When the heart\npumps blood, the blood shoots through the body at a fairly rapid speed. The muscular\ncontractions of the heart produce a certain amount of pressure which produces this\npumping action throughout the body. But sometimes the pressure builds up too high. This\nalso is not the fault of the heart.\nHere are some of the things which produce high blood pressure:\n- Hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) is a primary cause. Earlier, the flexing of the\nwalls kept the pressure lower.\n- A second major cause of hypertension is a reduction in the size (interior dimension) of\nthe arteries. They come to look like old water pipes, with congealed stuff sticking to the\nwalls. For years, certain things had been eaten which caused this problem (meat fat,\ngrease, saturated fats, hydrogenated vegetables oils, margarine, butter, corn chips, etc.).\n- Too much sodium in the diet, for too long a time, is another cause of hypertension. The\nsolution should have been to cut out the sodium (salty) foods.\n- Other causes include stress, enzyme imbalances, certain drugs (including oral\ncontraceptives), and nutritional deficiencies.\n- There are still more factors which could be involved: hyperthyroidism, kidney disease,\nadrenal or pituitary disorders, and heredity.\nUnfortunately, there is no pain as the hardening and clogging of arteries (which produce hypertension)\nprogresses. So people keep living and eating the way they should not until one day the crisis comes.\nHEART FAILURE—So far, we have only discussed heart attack, which is an interruption in blood\nflow to the heart. But there is also heart failure, which is inadequate blood flow from the heart. It is not\nproviding enough blood to supply the needs of the body. Heart failure can be either acute (short-term) or\nchronic.\nHere are some of the problems which, over a period of time, can occur in the heart:\n1 - Arrhythmia. The heart does not beat right. The natural rhythms are more irregular. This\nis caused by problems in the cells in the heart which send out electrical signals to do the\npumping sequences.\n2 - Palpitations occur when the heart seems to pound, whether regular or irregular.\n3 - Tachycardia is when the heart beats too fast when it is resting.\n4 - Bradycardia is when the heart beats too slowly.\n5 - Ectopic beats (also called skipped beats) are beats which are premature, producing\nlonger rests between some beats than between others.\n6 - Fibrillation and flutter are a little different. An electrical error occurs, which sends\nsome beat signals to the heart muscle (causing it to twitch) instead of carrying out its\nnormal blood pumping action.\n7 - Valvular disease is the name for problems in the heart valves, so they do not open and/\nor shut properly. Sometimes this is congenital; other times it is caused by rheumatic fever\nor endocarditis (infection of the heart muscle).\nOTHER HEART PROBLEMS—There are a variety of problems which trace their cause to coronary\nproblems, artery problems, or heart muscle problems. Here are some of them:\n1 - Cardiomegaly (cardiac hypertrophy) occurs when the heart can no longer function\nnormally; it works so hard that it enlarges. But this only weakens it. Causes include too\nmuch resistance from blood flow through the arteries.\n2 - Congestive heart failure is a chronic condition that results in fluids accumulating in the\nheart and edema in the feet and ankles. There is labored breathing after mild exertion.\n3 - Cardiac arrest happens when the heart just stops beating. Because fresh blood is no\nlonger reaching the brain, the person falls unconscious. Coronary artery problems are\noften the cause.\nThere are other problems which can occur in the heart, which can also weaken it. But these do not trace\ntheir causes to coronary or artery problems.\n1 - Carditis is an infection in the heart muscle, sometimes caused by rheumatic fever. It\ncan lead to permanent heart damage.\n2 - Endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium. This is the sac-like membrane which\nsurrounds the heart. People with damaged immune systems (from HIV, etc.) can acquire\nit. It can also be caused by surgery to replace defective heart valves. Permanent heart\ndamage occurs.\n3 - Cardiomyopathy summarizes several heart problems, including enlargement of one or\nmore heart chambers, heart muscle rigidity, etc. Causes include inherited defects and\ncertain diseases.",

      "overview": "Here is a brief overview of some of the problems which require changes, if you would avoid a later\nbuild-up of conditions leading to a heart attack:\n- Too many saturated fats in the diet (animal fats or hydrogenated vegetable oils).\nExcessive use of overheated or oxidized vegetable oils.\n- Lack of natural fat emulsifiers (lecithin) in the diet.\n- An excess of salt and other sodium products. Drinking chemically softened water. Water\nsofteners have sodium in them.\n- Elevated cholesterol, triglyceride, and uric acid levels.\n- A low HDL-to-cholesterol ratio.\n- An excess of carbohydrates (especially refined ones) and sugar. Sugar increases\ntriglyceride levels, platelet adhesiveness, uric acid levels, and blood pressure.\n- An excess of vitamin D intake (from meat, milk, eggs, or sunlight). Over 3000 units a\nday add to the plaque development and hardening of atherosclerosis. Carotene (provitamin A) in the diet, from orange and yellow vegetables and fruits, will not cause this\nproblem.\n- A deficiency of vitamins and minerals.\n- The use of coffee, alcohol, and tobacco.\n- Lack of exercise.\n- Overweight.\n- High blood pressure.\n- Diabetes or gout.\n- Taking birth control pills.\n- Heavy metal poisoning.\n- A family history of heart trouble.\nChange everything in the above list that you can, and you will live a lot longer.\nHere is still more information:\nTo properly understand the information given in this article, be sure to read the other articles in this\nsection, especially those listed at the end of this one, and in the next (dealing with circulatory problems).\n- Check your heart beat every so often. The best way to begin the day is to check your\npulse when you wake up in the morning. If it is under 60 beats per minute, you are doing\nall right. But if your resting heart rate is above 80, that is not so good, and indicates that\nhypertension may be in progress of occurring. An estimated 25% of those who have heart\nattacks experienced no previous symptoms. So, right now, start eating right and living\nright.\n- High blood pressure, using tobacco, high cholesterol levels, stress, obesity, sedentary\nliving, diabetes, and type-A personality are causes of heart trouble. These are things you\ncan change.\nHere are a variety of factors which you should consider:\n- Do not use MSG (monosodium glutamate). Locate your food allergies and eliminate\nthem (see \"Pulse Test\"). Do not use caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, sugar, and processed\nfoods.\n- Caffeine blocks the breakdown of adrenaline, resulting in the same response as heavy\nstress. Heavy caffeine consumption doubles the risk of coronary heart disease.\n- The dangers of tobacco in producing heart attacks and other heart problems are welldocumented.\n- Do not eat any types of grease or oil (fatty foods, meat, margarine, butter, peanut butter,\nhydrogenated oil), except a small amount of cold-pressed vegetable oil. (See \"Cholesterol,\nReducing,\" for much more detail.)\n- Fat is in all meat. Do not eat meat and you will have a longer life. It is well-known that\nvegetarians live longer than others. They have less coronary disease, less heart attacks,\nand less heart failure.\n- If you are an adult, avoid vitamin D. More than 400 IU per day result in calcification of\nthe coronary arteries.\n- Research studies by the Chinese reveal that constipation is a significant factor in many\nheart attacks.\n- Eat smaller meals.\n- Be sure and drink enough water every day, and frequently throughout the day! This\ncannot be stressed enough. Sludged blood is a very real cause of heart and vessel\nproblems.\n- Eat a high fiber diet, using whole grains, brown rice, beans, and fresh fruit and\nvegetables. Through nourishing food and supplements, obtain all the vitamins and\nminerals. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium are important; so are the vitamins (A, B\ncomplex, C, and E). Eat Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp for trace minerals. Flaxseed\noil contains Omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce risk of coronary heart and cardiovascular\ndisease. L-carnitine helps dissolve fat deposits around the heart. CoQ10 and germanium\nstrengthen veins and provide oxygen to the blood and cells.\n- If you tend to experience angina attacks at night, place 3-4-inch blocks under the head of\nyour bed. This will reduce the attacks. More blood pools in the legs, and not so much tries\nto crowd in through the narrowed arteries into the heart.\nSodium is a problem which must be dealt with, since it can increase the likelihood of heart disease.\nHere are items to omit from the diet:\n- Table salt. Use a small amount of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp instead.

Prevention—living right and\neating right ahead of time—is the best key to success.\nHere are additional things to think about:\n- Heart disease: Eat no fried foods. Avoid vitamin D. Obtain essential fatty acids; the best\nis cold-pressed flaxseed oil or wheat germ oil; also take selenium, vitamin E, 5-10 alfalfa\ntablets daily. And, if needed, obtain HCl. Take a 30-minute walk outside every day. Keep\na 30-minute oxygen tank in your house, ready to use when you need it.\n- Palpitations: Do not eat MSG, caffeine, sugar, or processed foods. Avoid food allergens.\nObtain vitamins B1, B3, C, selenium, and potassium.\n- Cardiac arrhythmia: Avoid food allergens and MSG. Add selenium, chromium,\nmagnesium, potassium, and CoQ10 to your diet. Hypoglycemia can be a cause.\n- Nervous heart: Causes can include anemia and low stomach acid. Obtain B1 and iron.\n- Angina: If you survive, take calcium, magnesium, essential fatty acids, and extra\nvitamins and minerals. Reduce vitamin D intake from all sources (meat, fish, dairy\nproducts, and the sun). Avoid caffeine, sugar, and cigarette smoke. Exercise for 30\nminutes every day.\n- Congestive heart failure: Causes can include lung disease and high blood pressure.\nObtain vitamin B1 and selenium.\n- Myocardial infarction: Rebuilding afterward (if you are still alive) should include\nvitamin C to bowel tolerance, vitamin E, selenium, vitamin A in the form of beta carotene.\nObtain HCl and pancreatic enzymes.\nHere is information about fats and oils:\nAnimal flesh contains fat. Do not eat animals. It increases blood cholesterol. But some vegetable oils are\na problem also. These are refined, heat-treated, and partly (or wholly) hydrogenated oils.\nHeating the oil changes it from the cis form to the trans form (also called a trans-fat), which is abnormal\nand can cause heart diseases, just as animal fats do. Only use cold-pressed vegetable oils, and not too\nmuch of that.\nThen there is the LDL and HDL story. It is also important, if you want to live longer. (In order to\nunderstand more fully the following facts, also read the articles, \"Triglycerides, Lowering\" and\n\"Cholesterol, Reducing.\" Much more information will be found there.)\nAll kinds of fats (both the grease and oil form) are carried in the blood in a protein-fat molecule, called a\nlipoprotein. There are two primary kinds: the low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are large\ncholesterol-laden molecules and the high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), which are smaller molecules with\nmore protein and less cholesterol and triglycerides.\nWhen found at high levels in the blood, the LDLs increase the risk of coronary heart disease. But high\nlevels of HDLs actually reduce the risk of heart disease. For this reason, the cholesterol-to-HDL ratio is\nvery important. Physicians even use it to estimate how likely it is that you will have a heart attack. The\nHDLs get rid of excess cholesterol in your bloodstream! They carry cholesterol from the blood to the\nliver so it can be converted into bile and eliminated from the body. Here are nutritional facts which have\nbeen found since the importance of HDLs was discovered:\n- Bran fiber reduces blood cholesterol and triglycerides, increases HDL, and lowers LDL.\nVery important, it also helps prevent recycling of bile from the bowel back to the liver.\n- Vitamin C helps increase HDL levels and lowers LDL levels. It also activates conversion\nof cholesterol into bile salts. Taking 1-2 grams a day can produce a 30% reduction in\ncholesterol levels which are 400 or above. Vitamin C also lowers triglyceride levels.\n- Vitamin E helps dissolve blood clots, dilates blood vessels, and conserves oxygen so the\nheart does not have to work as hard. Because of its antioxidant function, it also prevents\nfatty acids from becoming toxic.\n- Vitamin B complex helps keep cholesterol from collecting plaque.\n- Flaxseed oil (and to a lesser extent, wheat germ oil) is rich in Omega 3EFA, and\ndecreases platelet adhesion, reduces blood cholesterol, and increases HDLs.\n- Lecithin is essential for utilizing fat and cholesterol in the body, and significantly lowers\nblood cholesterol levels.\n- Brewer's yeast and chromium 15 lower HDL levels, and cause atherosclerotic plaques to\nrecede.\n- Garlic lowers blood cholesterol and reduces platelet adhesiveness, as well as lowering\ntriglycerides and increasing HDLs. (It also helps normalize blood pressure.)\n- Alfalfa meal (from ground seeds) contains saponins which prevent bile-like substances\nfrom recirculating to the liver.\n- Soy protein lowers blood cholesterol.\n- It should be noted that coronary bypass surgery has failed to prevent second heart\nattacks or extend life. It is not the \"cure\" for coronary atherosclerosis and severe angina,\nas suggested. The disease is systemic, and heavily influenced by nutritional, and other,\nfactors. Bypass operations are not the solution. They are only emergency repair jobs\nwhich do not remove the cause—which, unless properly corrected, will only return.\n- Fortunately, even the most advanced cases of heart disease can be helped by the\ndiscoveries provided by nutritional research.\n—Also see \"Triglycerides, Lowering\"; \"Cholesterol, Reducing\"; Hypertension\"; \"Stroke\"; and\n\"Arteriosclerosis and Atherosclerosis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus is today in heaven preparing mansions for those who love Him; yes,\nmore than mansions, a kingdom which is to be ours. But all who shall inherit these blessings must be\npartakers of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ. Obey the Ten Commandments, and live to help\nand bless others.",

We will do all we can to help and encourage others.\nSection 8\nCardiovascular\nPart 2\nCirculatory\nARTERIOSCLEROSIS (Hardening of the Arteries)\nand\nATHEROSCLEROSIS (Plaque Development and Hardening)\nSYMPTOMS—Early warning symptoms are intermittent claudication (which see). These are pains in\nthe legs and possibly feet, which leave upon resting. High blood pressure (see \"Hypertension\"). The later\nresult is angina (chest pains) and heart attack.\nCAUSES—These are two separate, major diseases, yet we list them together because the problems,\neffects, and solutions are so similar.\nArteriosclerosis is hardening of the walls of the arteries; atherosclerosis is the hardening of plaque on the\nwalls, which causes the walls to harden. (The full explanation is somewhat more complicated.)\nHardened walls produce higher blood pressure, but plaque-hardened and narrow vessels does it also.\nThe end result of both is a heart attack.\nThe main difference between the two is that arteriosclerosis is primarily the hardened walls themselves\n(which the plaque especially produced). Whereas atherosclerosis is the thickening of that plaque in the\narteries, so that the space for the blood to flow through keeps narrowing. In arteriosclerosis, these\ndeposits are primarily composed of calcium; in atherosclerosis, the deposits consist of fatty substances,\nprimarily cholesterol (a blood protein). But, much of the time, an odd assortment of both, along with\nlipoproteins, fatty acids, fibrous scar tissue, and blood clump together.\nBoth conditions have essentially the same effect on circulation, both cause hardening of the artery walls,\nboth cause high blood pressure, and both eventually lead to one or more of the same things: angina\n(which is chest pain following exertion), heart attack (the heart muscle can no longer bear the lack of\nblood supply to it), and stroke (when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off). Death may or may\nnot follow. The problem is that a clot of this plaque breaks loose, flows through the arteries, and gets\nstuck in a narrower artery. If this occurs in the heart muscle, angina and a heart attack may result; if in\nthe brain, a stroke occurs.\nTo complicate the matter further, not only can arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis cause high blood\npressure, but high blood pressure intensifies them both.\nCauses include elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels, eating high cholesterol foods (such as meat,\neggs, whole milk, or milk products).\nOther causes include smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, diabetes, emotional stress,\nlack of exercise, or a family history of the disease. Advancing age increases the risk factor.\nPain in the legs (usually in the calf, but sometimes in the feet or elsewhere in the legs), which increase\nwhen walking but stops as soon as one rests, is intermittent claudication (which see). There may also be\nweakness, numbness, and a heavy feeling in the legs. This is a symptom of atherosclerosis in the limbs\n(peripheral atherosclerosis). There can also, but less often, be pain in the arms.\nThere is a home test you can do to help determine if this is beginning to occur: Test the pulse in your\nlegs and foot. There are three places where this can be done: Apply light pressure on the top of the foot,\nthe inner hollow of the ankle, and in the hollow behind the knee. If you feel no pulse, then the artery\nmay be narrowing.\nAtherosclerosis is the most common form of arterial disease in the U.S. and most frequently occurs in\nthe lower limbs. It is the primary cause of death over the age of 65. Over 50% of the people between 65\nand 70 will die of some form of this.",

Wheat bran, and other particulate,\nfibers are not as effective as those in fruits, vegetables, and legumes.\n- Eat foods rich in vitamin E. This includes nuts, seeds, and whole grains.\n- Only use cold-pressed vegetable oils (soy, corn, wheat germ, flaxseed). Never heat these\noils; place them on your food at the table.\n- Avoid refined sugar. It has been shown to increase serum cholesterol levels, leading to\natherosclerosis.\n- Do not eat animal protein; there is a definite connection between eating it and\ncardiovascular disease.\n- Do not eat processed, junk, dairy, white flour, spiced, or fried foods. Avoid pies, ice\ncream, salt, egg yolks, sugar, coffee, colas, nicotine, and alcohol.\n- Garlic eaten with cholesterol foods tends to reduce the likelihood that cholesterol will\nclog the arteries.\n- If you know you are moving toward artery problems, eat no free oils.\n- Eggplant tends to lower cholesterol levels.\n- Both peanut oil and coconut oil increase atherosclerosis.\n- Drink only distilled water.\n- Reduce stress and avoid situations causing it.\n- Get regular moderate exercise. Walking every day is the best. Build up slowly, but keep\nat it.\n- A strict vegetarian diet (without milk and eggs) is a good way to avoid artery problems.\n- Research at the University of Wisconsin disclosed that skim milk did not lower blood\ncholesterol.\n- Overweight people should reduce. Even 20% or more above ideal weight carries a\nsignificantly increased risk of atherosclerosis. What is your ideal weight? Assume 100\npounds for the first five feet; add to this five pounds for each inch over that, for women;\nadd seven pounds per inch over that, for men.\n- Do not smoke or use nicotine in any other form. Avoid second-hand smoke.\n- Do not take shark cartilage. It may inhibit production of new blood vessels needed to\nincrease blood circulation.\n- Eliminate all environmental sources of metal poisoning, such as aluminum or copper\ncooking utensils, copper or lead plumbing, lead-glazed ceramics, contaminated water, etc.\nToxic metals are known to be deposited, among other places, on artery walls.\n- X-rays make premature arteriosclerosis more likely.\n- Do not eat big evening meals. Best: Only eat plain fruit and plain bread for supper, and\ndo this several hours before bedtime.\n- Chromium (found in brewer's yeast, whole grains, and supplements) added to the diet\nlowers cholesterol.\n- Keep the extremities warm, to maintain good circulation in them.\n- Do not wear constrictive clothing (belts, garters, girdles, tight hosiery, etc.)\n- Glucose intolerance can produce a 100% increased risk of atherosclerosis. Keep your\nblood sugar levels normal. Do not binge on sweets, etc.\n- Avoid constipation, which weakens the liver and kidneys, which in turn sludges the\nblood. The Chinese treat stroke by treating constipation.\n- Drink enough water!\n- Periodically check your blood pressure.\n- Too much vitamin D can elevate blood cholesterol.\n—Also see \"Triglycerides, Lowering\"; \"Cholesterol, Reducing\"; Hypertension\"; \"Stroke\"; and \"Cardiac\nProblems.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—He whose life consists in ever receiving and never giving soon loses the\nblessings he has. We must constantly seek to help others. Only in this way can God bless us.\nHYPOTENSION (Low Blood Pressure)\nSYMPTOMS—There are generally few symptoms which will tend to alert you to the problem. There\nmay be headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, inability to concentrate, or digestive disturbances.\nThere can be low energy and dizzy feelings when you stand up fast from a lying down or sitting\nposition, fainting, blurred vision, palpitations, inability to solve simple problems, and slurring of speech.\nCAUSES—The pressure at which the blood travels through the arteries is lower than normal, which\nmeans the blood is not circulating through the body quite as efficiently.\nThis is the \"disease\" which many people are thankful to have. High blood pressure can be a killer; low\nblood pressure is generally just something to live with.\nA researcher who investigated the strange death of Pope John Paul I (who had low blood pressure and\nfew other physical problems) asked 30 physicians and specialists whether low blood pressure would\nshorten life. Each one said it would tend to lengthen, rather than shorten, life expectancy.\nFor this reason, you will find that medical guides say relatively little about hypotension.\nIn some instances, low blood pressure is due to an impoverished diet, the existence of some chronic\nwasting disease, or some other condition that needs treatment on its own account. So it can be a\nsymptom of some other problem (such as hypothyroidism, which see).\nHypotension can be caused by prescribed drugs, kidney disease, low blood sugar, food allergies,\ndehydration, adrenal exhaustion, or hypothyroidism.",

They will openly rejoice in all He has done and tell others how He can answer\ntheir needs also.\nHYPERTENSION (High Blood Pressure)\nSYMPTOMS—There may be no symptoms; but, if they occur, they may include headache, difficulty in\nbreathing, blurred vision, rapid pulse, or a feeling of dizziness.\nOverweight, a ruddy complexion, and apparently robust health may be the only outward manifestations\nin a man 50 or 60, who may have systolic pressure as high as 200 or more.\nHypertension is called the \"silent killer\" because it so often reveals few symptoms.\nCAUSES—High blood pressure is just that: The pressure of blood flow through the arteries is higher\nthan it should be, and that pressure consistently remains higher.\nA blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer) registers two readings: The first and higher one is the\nsystolic; the second and lower one is the diastolic. The diastolic pressure occurs just before the heart\nbeats, and is less important for determining blood pressure. But the systolic pressure reveals the pressure\nbuilt up as the heart pumps blood out of the heart into the aorta (and thence through the arteries). High\nsystolic pressure indicates that the cell walls are hardened and/or plaques are forming in the arteries,\nwhich are narrowing the passageways.\nAverage normal systolic blood pressure in an adult varies between 120 and 150 millimeters of mercury,\nand tends to increase with age. The arteries of older people tend to harden and thicken with age, and this\nproduces the higher readings in later life.\nThe age, in relation to the figures, tells a lot: Systolic readings of 140-150 at 55 to 70 years of age need\nnot be considered high; but, occurring in a man of 30, it points to a definite problem which needs\nattention.\nNormal blood pressure readings for adults vary from 110/70 to 140/90 while readings of 140/90 to\n160/90 or 160/95 indicate borderline hypertension. Any reading over 180/115 is far too elevated.\nThe hardening and clogging produces changes in the arteries, which produce hypertension, and are\ncaused by aging, emotional stress, food, overeating, and heredity. Tobacco is another cause of\nhypertension, as is the taking of oral contraceptives. Drinking coffee or tea, drug abuse, and high sodium\nintake are other causes.\nHypertension can result in coronary artery disease, enlargement of the heart, or strokes. The acute\ninfections (such as tonsillitis, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever), or focal infections from tonsils or teeth,\nsometimes lead to Bright's disease (a kidney disease), which is accompanied by high blood pressure.\nSudden attacks of convulsions in pregnant women (eclampsia), and other kidney diseases of pregnancy,\nusually cause high blood pressure.\nPrimary hypertension (about 90% of the cases) do not have a direct cause. The rest (secondary\nhypertension) occurs as a result of other diseases. At any one time, about 10% of the people in America\nhave primary hypertension. It affects over half of all people in the U.S. over 65. African-Americans have\nit more than a third more often than whites. Those who are 18-44 have it 18 times more often than\nwhites. Women have hypertension less often than men until menopause is over; then, soon after, they\nhave it as often.\nHeavy snorers are more likely to have high blood pressure than silent sleepers.",

This briefly cuts off blood flow to a portion of the brain.\nA thrombus is a clot inside the brain which blocks the flow of blood to the brain.\nAn aneurysm is a portion of an artery that balloons outward. Filled with blood, this weak spot bursts.\nA hemorrhage is a damaged artery within the brain which bursts.\nSometimes a tumor, not a clot, is blocking an artery supplying the brain.\nWhatever the cause, the result is local brain tissue death from lack of oxygen and food.\nIf the damaged area is small enough, the brain will reroute the affected brain functions to other areas of\nthe brain, as a period of relearning and compensation occurs.",

      "overview": "PROBLEMS—The two major sources of fat in your bloodstream are cholesterol and triglycerides. Both\nare necessary. Cholesterol helps build strong cells, and triglycerides provide energy.\nBut if either is too high, problems develop.\nHigh cholesterol levels clog arteries. High triglycerides cause vascular disease also, if they are\nassociated with low levels of HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). You then have fat particles in your\nblood which can ultimately be bad for your heart.\nYou can control your triglyceride level, and you want to keep it below 150.\nSOLUTIONS—Here are several ways to do it:\nCut down on the amount of fat in your diet. Reduce total fat intake to less than 30% of daily calories;\nbut, even better, reduce it to 20%. Reduce saturated fats to 10%.\nEat a lot of complex carbohydrates. Races doing this do not have a triglyceride problem. Cook rice,\nbeans, and other grains without including fat in the cooking or the serving.\nDo not eat candy, sweets, and sugar. Eating such simple carbohydrates in the diet are a significant factor\nin causing people to have high triglyceride levels.\nPut more fiber in the diet. A low fiber, high sweet, diet is even worse than high sweets alone.\nLose weight. Even losing 10 pounds can reduce triglycerides in those who are 20-30% overweight.\nUltimately, try to maintain a weight that is not over 5-10% above what is normal for your age-weight\nrange.\nDo not drink alcohol; it decidedly increases triglycerides.\nExercise is very helpful in lowering triglyceride levels. Studies reveal that it does this—even when\nweight is not lowered in the process.\nGo on a rice diet for a couple days. In 1944, Dr. Walter Kempner discovered that a rice diet would\ndramatically lower triglycerides.\nThis is a diet of rice and fruit alone, and no other food, for 2-3 days or as long as you can stand to\nremain on it. The diet is not appetizing, but it really works. One patient went down from 1,000 mg/dl to\n117 mg/dl in a couple months. In just 2-3 days, triglycerides will go down a fair amount. Then, later,\nyou can do it again for another couple days.\nBy the way, when you do this, you will lose a some weight also. The rice/fruit diet is practically fat-free.\nBut do not remain on a rice diet! It does not provide adequate nutriments.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Do not dwell on your difficulties, so they get bigger and bigger. Instead, think\non the love of Christ and plead with Him for the help you need. Be trustful and obedient, and He will\ngive you the best answers.",

      "overview": "PROBLEMS—Here are some facts about cholesterol, to help you understand the situation:\nDietary cholesterol is in the food you eat. Most of it is found in eggs and meat. One egg has 275 mg, and\nan apple has none.\nSerum cholesterol is in your bloodstream. This is what your physician measures. Ideally, it should be\nunder 200. There are two types of serum cholesterol:\nHDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol cleans the arteries and is good for you. The higher it is, the\nbetter.\nLDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol clogs the arteries and is bad for you. The lower it is, the\nbetter.\nSOLUTIONS—Here are several ways to lower the amount of LDL cholesterol in your blood:\nDo not eat saturated fat. This is the kind in meat, butter, cheese, and hydrogenated oil—which is the\nworst kind of oil or fat, since it raises blood cholesterol the most.\nOnly include polyunsaturated fat in your meals. It lowers blood cholesterol. This kind is only found in\ncertain vegetable oils, such as corn oil, soy oil, wheat germ oil, and flaxseed oil. Only buy cold-pressed\noil—never, never hydrogenated oil (even partially hydrogenated oil). Never put cottonseed oil into your\nbody.\nThe very best oils for your health are wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil. Prepare your meals without oil,\nfat, or grease. Then add a spoonful or two of wheat germ oil or flaxseed oil to the food after it has been\ndished onto your plate. In this way, you can carefully measure how much you get, and you ensure that\nthe oil was not cooked.\nIt is safe to use monounsaturated oils. These include olive oil and certain other foods, such as nuts,\navocados, canola oil, and peanut oil. It now known that this also lowers blood cholesterol.\nMonounsaturated oils lower cholesterol faster than low-fat diets do, and the type they selectively lower\nis the bad LDL.\nDo not eat fried food, fatty food, meat, or vegetable loafs, etc. Do not eat processed or junk food. Do not\neat regular peanut butter. The peanut oil has been taken out, and cheap, hydrogenated oils (sometimes\nlard) is put in its place. Only buy peanut butter from a health food store. You can open the lid and smell\nthe difference. Learn how to smell good food. Do not eat corn chips, crackers, and other snack foods.\nEggs contain a lot of cholesterol (275 mg per egg), yet studies reveal that, in most people, they do not\nappreciably raise cholesterol levels.\nEat more fruit and beans. Both have pectin, which surrounds cholesterol and takes it out of the body.\nPectin is in all kinds of beans and fruit. Carrots also help lower cholesterol, because of their pectin\ncontent. Cabbage, broccoli, and onions also have calcium pectate.\nOat bran lowers cholesterol in the same way that pectin does it. Make oat bran muffins, and eat one or\ntwo every day. Oatmeal is also effective.\nYou need 6 grams of soluble fiber every day. Corn and wheat bran are also useful.\nFresh garlic lowers cholesterol, but not cooked or deodorized garlic. It is said that Kyolic may also lower\ncholesterol.\nPsyllium seed also lowers cholesterol.\nExercise does it too. Vigorous exercise raise HDL and lowers LDL levels.\nDo not drink coffee, use tobacco, or drink. Avoid drugs of all kinds.\nHere are other things found to lower cholesterol: barley, spirulina, lemongrass oil, and activated\ncharcoal.\nVitamins C, E, and niacin also lower cholesterol, along with calcium.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We are to love God not only with mind and heart, but with the strength also.\nWe are to treat our bodies carefully, for we belong to God.",

    "title": "Phlebitis And Thrombophlebitis (Milk Leg)",
    "fields": {
      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Phlebitis: Reddening and cord-like swelling of the vein, increased pulse rate, slight\nfever, and pain accompanying movement of the afflicted area.\nSuperficial thrombophlebitis: The affected vein can be felt and feels harder than normal veins. It may\nappear as a reddish line under the skin, possibly accompanied by pain, localized swelling, and tender to\nthe touch.\nDeep thrombophlebitis: Pain, warmth, and swelling, with possible bluish discoloration of the skin of the\nlimb it is in. Sometimes there is fever and chills. The pain frequently feels like a deep soreness that\nintensifies when standing or walking, and lessens when sitting or, especially, when the legs are elevated.\nVery often the deep vein in the thigh is involved.\nCAUSES—Phlebitis is the inflammation of a vein wall, usually occurs in the legs, and occurs more\noften in women than men. It can be a complication of varicose veins (which see). It can be caused by\nchildbirth, infections resulting from injuries to the veins, and operations. Infections in the legs, feet, and\ntoes must be given immediate attention (especially if a fungal origin is involved).\nThere are two types of thrombophlebitis. The first is superficial thrombophlebitis, which affects a\nsubcutaneous vein near the surface of the skin. This is generally not serious and many experience it. But\nif there is widespread vein involvement, the lymphatic vessels may also become inflamed, and fluids\nmay collect.\nThe superficial type can result from infection, lack of exercise, standing for long periods, infection, and\nintravenous drug use.\nObesity, varicose veins, pregnancy, allergies, environmental chemicals, injury, and smoking can\nincrease the risk.\nDeep thrombophlebitis, also known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is more serious. It affects\nmuscular veins far below the surface, which are much larger, and can often come after confinement. The\nreduced blood flow can produce chronic venous insufficiency, evinced by pigmentation, skin rash, or\nulceration. But sometimes there are no symptoms. The risk of DVT rapidly increases after the age of 40,\nand triples with the passing of each decade after it.\nEven though the person remains in bed until the swelling subsides, it will return slightly when he gets\nout of bed. Very little standing or exercise should be permitted while any swelling persists.\nIf the opening in the vein, in the thigh, is narrowed too much by the phlebitis (and nearly always if it is\nentirely clogged), varicose veins will appear lower down on the leg.\nBlood Clots: Blood clots can be very dangerous. The origin of a clot is generally unknown. But it can\nform, following an injury to the inside lining of a blood vessel. This initiates clotting, which is part of\nthe repair process. Blood platelets clump together to protect the injured area. Fibrogen arrives and\nentraps blood cells, plasma, and more platelets, which make a blood clot to protect the weakened wall.\nIf a clot forms, it can break off and travel to a vital organ. Massage or rubbing may cause part of the clot\nto be dislodged and pass to other parts of the body, especially the lungs, causing serious damage or\ndeath. If there is any possibility that the person might have blood clots, he should not receive massage.",

      "overview": "- If a swollen, painful vein does not disappear within 2 weeks, consult a physician.\n- Include niacin in the diet. This B vitamin helps prevent clotting. Vitamin C helps\nstrengthen the walls of veins and arteries. Vitamin E dilates blood vessels, reducing the\nformation of varicose veins and phlebitis.\n- Eat a good nourishing diet of fruits, vegetables, raw nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole\ngrains.\n- Do not eat fried, salty, processed foods; dairy products; or hydrogenated vegetable oils.\nDo not eat meat.\n- A high-protein diet increases blood-clotting factors.\n- Use enough fiber in the diet, so you do not have to strain at the stool. Straining increases\nvenous pressure on the legs.\n- Maintain a low-fat diet and drink enough water.\n- It is now known that food allergies can be involved. Search them out and eliminate them.\n- Get regular moderate exercise. This is important. Walking is the best. Regular exercise\nincreases the body's ability to dissolve clots.\n- Avoid dangling the feet. Pressure against the popliteal vessels may cause obstruction of\nblood flow. Do not cross your legs.\n- Deep breathing or singing helps empty out the large veins, thus increasing venous\ncirculation.\n- Quit tobacco. If you smoke, and seem to keep having recurring phlebitis, you may have\nBuerger's disease (which see). Its symptoms are severe pain and blood clots, usually in the\nlegs. Smoking constricts the blood vessels.\n- Superficial phlebitis inflammation generally is reduced within 7-10 days, but it may be 36 weeks for the problem to be entirely gone. It can be treated by elevating the leg and\napplying warm, moist heat to the area. It is not necessary to rest in bed; but, every so\noften, rest with the leg 6-10 inches above the heart. This speeds the healing process.\n- Take alternating hot and cold sitz baths or apply alternating hot and cold compresses.\n- Lie on a slant board with your feet higher than your head for 15 minutes a day,\nespecially if you stand on your feet a lot.\n- Do not wear anything tight about the waist, or bands on the legs.\n- If you have to travel a distance by car, stop and walk around every so often. Do not let\nthe circulation become sluggish. When it enters a low-flow state, that can lead to a clot.\n- Beware of \"economy class syndrome.\" A remarkable number of people who fly in the\ncramped economy class seats of jets develop thromboplebitis. You are confined to your\nseat more on planes than in cars or boats. So request an aisle seat and get up every 30\nminutes and walk up and down the aisles.\n- Wherever you may be, do not sit more than an hour at a time, without getting up and\nwalking around.\n- Better yet, every hour exercise the legs for 2 minutes, as if you are riding a bike (lifting\nthe legs), and breathe deep, in and out, 15 times.\n- Walking barefoot improves venous blood flow.\n- If they help you feel better, use elastic stockings (antiembolism stockings).\n- Do not squat (sit back on your heels), except momentarily.\n- If you have a history of phlebitis or blood clots, do not take the birth control pill. It will\nincrease the likelihood of deep vein thrombophlebitis by 3-4 times.\n- Once you have had phlebitis, or clots of any type, you can have it again. Surgery or\nprolonged bed rests increase the likelihood that you will have another attack. Keep that in\nmind when you consider elective surgery.\n- Fasting decreases blood coagulation, and can be beneficial when needed.\n- If you have to lie in bed for a time, move your legs every so often, to increase\ncirculation. Elevate the foot of your bed several inches, to reduce venous pressure in your\nlegs. This also reduces edema and pain. Do not use pillows under the legs, for doing so\nelevates the knee above the digestive organs and reduces circulation.\n—Also see \"Varicose Veins.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God every day for the many blessings you have. Determine that you\nwill remain true to Him. By His enabling grace, resist temptations and obey His moral law.",

There is a sensitivity to cold, poor appetite, and cravings for clay, ice, or starch.\nCAUSES—There are several types of anemia (simple, pernicious, sickle cell, folic acid, copper, etc.)\nThis article will deal only with simple anemia.\nMillions of people are anemic. The cause is usually a reduction in the number of red blood cells, or the\namount of hemoglobin, in the blood. In either case, not enough oxygen is carried throughout the body.\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, and occurs when there is not enough iron in\nthe body.\nThis can occur when the body is not absorbing enough iron from the food, during chronic blood loss,\npregnancy, menstruation, hemorrhoids or ulcers, diverticular disease, liver damage, surgery, repeated\npregnancies, periods of rapid growth, and aging.\nInfections, hemorrhage, and nutritional deficiencies can also cause it.\nInfants and young children on a milk diet, without minerals and essential fatty acids, are prone to\nanemia.\nRed blood cells are called erythrocytes, and are tiny discs which are concave on both sides. These cells\ncontain hemoglobin, which is bright red because of the iron in it. About 60-70% of the iron in your body\nis in the hemoglobin in your blood. (About 30-35% of the iron is stored in the liver.) There are more red\nblood cells (RBCs) in the blood than elsewhere. The percentage of RBCs in the blood is called the\nhematocrit. The primary function of the RBCs is to carry oxygen to the cells.\nFollowing birth, the bone marrow of the infant, child, and adult makes the red blood cells. Aging causes\nRBC formation to lessen. An average RBC wears out in 120 days or less, so your body must keep\nmaking more.",

      "overview": "- Eat at least 1 tbsp. of blackstrap molasses each day (1 tsp. for a child). This is the richest\nsource of food iron.\n- Avoid milk and other dairy products, since these decrease iron absorption from other\nfoods.\n- Avoid these oxalic acid foods which include spinach, sorrel, Swiss chard, chocolate,\ncocoa, and soda. Almonds, cashews, and most nuts and beans also have some. Broccoli,\nlettuce, and tomatoes help iron regeneration.\n- Never eat rhubarb; it is extremely high in oxalic acid.\n- Avoid spicy foods, tea, or coffee. They decrease absorption. Do not smoke, and avoid\nsecond-hand smoke.\n- Bran tends to link with iron and carry it out in the stool. (However, you may need bran to\nprevent other physical problems far worse than a mild case of simple anemia.) Whole\nwheat flour and oatmeal are effective in increasing hemoglobin regeneration.\n- Orange juice increases iron absorption.\n- There should be sufficient stomach acid to absorb the minerals. If there is not, take some\nlemon juice.\n- Yeast and wheat germ are high in iron. Similar foods include beets, beet greens,\ncabbage, whole grains, celery, parsley, cherries, dates, figs, and pears.\n- Do not take calcium, vitamin E, or zinc at the same time as iron supplements. They\ninterfere with each other's absorption.\n- Use a diet high in fresh, raw fruits and vegetables, which are high in vitamin C (which is\nnecessary for iron absorption).\n- Omitting sugar increases iron absorption.\n- Bananas are moderately helpful in increasing iron absorption.\n- Many medicinal drugs destroy vitamin E and cause anemia. Some insecticides destroy\nbone marrow, so new blood cells cannot be made.\n- Do not use food additives or artificial sweeteners.\n- It is said that cooking food in iron pots increases the iron content of the food.\n- Water from deep wells has more iron than city water.\n- Exercise stimulates the production of blood.\n- Short, cold baths increase blood production and circulation.\n- A cold mitten friction is a useful way to increase metabolism and blood production.\n- Have a complete blood test taken, so you will be certain whether or not you have iron\nanemia. Too much iron can damage the heart, liver, pancreas, and immune cells' activity.\nIt has also been linked to cancer. If you do not need them, avoid iron supplements.\n- Ferrous sulfate and other iron compounds are often given to reduce anemia, but they\ndefinitely have toxic effects which you should be aware of:\nThey destroy carotene and vitamins A, C, and E. They increase the need of the body for\noxygen and damage unsaturated fatty acids. They also damage the liver, especially when\nthe person has a poor appetite and is not eating very much.\n- Iron salts taken during pregnancy are especially dangerous! They can increase the fetus'\nneed for oxygen, induce miscarriage or premature and postmature births. Some infants\nhave malformations or mental deficiencies because their mothers took iron supplements\nbefore birth.\n- Normal people do not need iron supplementation, for there is lots of iron in most real\n(real) food. The iron in unrefined food is never toxic. All iron supplements cause stomach\nor intestinal irritation.\n- Those who are anemic tend to have sore mouths or tongues, generally have poor blood\ncirculation, and are cold. They need special care in regard to these matters.\n—Also see \"Anemia—2,\" \"Chlorosis,\" and \"Pernicious Anemia.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—We are to have a spirit of pity and compassion toward those who have\ntrespassed against us.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—When a wound occurs, blood does not clot normally.\nEarly warning signs of internal bleeding include a bubbling or tingling sensation or a feeling of warmth,\ntightness, or stiffness in the hemorrhaging area.\nHeadache, confusion, drowsiness, or a blow to the head may indicate bleeding in the head.\nIf your hemophiliac child cries for no apparent reason, refuses to walk, use his arm or leg, or seems to\nhave a swelling or unusual bruising, go to an emergency room.\nCAUSES—Hemophilia is hereditary. It primarily affects males and is passed down through females\n(who are carriers). Children of carriers have a 50% chance of inheriting the defective gene. If they\ninherit it, the boys will be hemophiliacs, and the girls will be carriers. The sons of hemophiliacs will not\ngive the problem to their sons, but the daughters will always be carriers.\nAs many as two-thirds of all hemophiliacs, in America, have HIV. They contracted it from contaminated\nblood transfusion sources. About 450 babies are born with hemophilia each year.\nThe blood of hemophiliacs does not clot properly, but minor bleeding is not serious. It is internal\nbleeding that can be fatal, if not treated.\nBleeding frequently occurs in the knees, which causes painful swelling. Repeated swelling destroys the\nknee cartilage and results in a permanently stiff knee (called hemophiliac arthritis). Other joints can also\nbe affected. Other body parts, including the brain, can also be affected by internal bleeding.",

God alone can, at all\ntimes, hear our cry for help.\nBLOOD POISONING (Septicemia)\nSYMPTOMS—Swelling, severe localized pain, discoloration, red streaks from the wound up the veins\ntoward the heart, and sores that do not heal.\nCAUSES—Whenever a sore, cut, or abrasion becomes red and infected, it could produce blood\npoisoning.",

Or crush one or more of the herbs listed later in\nthis article.\n- Take a high enema.\n- Drink as many cups of echinacea tea a day as possible.\n- Keep the temperature evenly warm, have enough air, and give a little cayenne in water\nwhen he feels chilly.\n- Drink charcoal water.\n- Wash wound thoroughly with boric solution. If discharge from the wound is thin, apply\npowdered 50-50 myrrh and goldenseal directly to the wound.\n- Go on a cleansing program of juice fasting for a time, followed by rebuilding on a good,\nnourishing diet.\n- Drink tea of chickweed, plantain, goldenseal, and myrrh.\nENCOURAGEMENT—It is a solemn thought that the removal of one safeguard from the conscience,\nthe failure to fulfill one duty, the formation of one wrong habit, may result not only in our own ruin, but\nin the ruin of another.\nSection 9\nNervous-Mental\nPart 1\nMiscellaneous\nINSOMNIA—1 (Sleeplessness; Sleep Apnea)\nSYMPTOMS—Inability to get to sleep, night after night.\nCAUSES—If it only happens once in a while, it is sleeplessness; if it happens for weeks or months, it is\ninsomnia. (Sleep apnea will be discussed later in this article.) It is said that 100 million Americans have\ninsomnia, to one degree or another, and take 600 tons of sleeping pills each year to avoid it. About seven\ntimes as many women as men experience the problem. Sleeping pills are second only to aspirin sales in\nthe U.S.\nSide effects from sleeping pills includes anxiety, depression, skin rashes, irritability, loss of appetite,\npoor coordination, digestive disturbances, difficulty with vision, confusion, dizziness, high blood\npressure, circulatory and respiration disorders, breakdown of parts of the blood (such as the white blood\ncells which fight infection), damage to the central nervous system, memory problems, and liver and\nkidney damage.\nThe experts tell us that, if you go to bed on time, have a current of fresh air in the room, and lay there\nquietly—you will get enough rest even though you do not seem to fall asleep as quickly as you might\nwish. Many people who report not getting to sleep at night actually slept quite a bit without realizing it.\nMany people have a hard time getting to sleep at night because of restless leg syndrome (which see).\nThese people are awakened by legs which twitch or kick.\nThere are others who experience sleep apnea. This occurs when the person, while asleep, stops\nbreathing for as long as two minutes at a time. He then gasps for breath and may awaken. This can\nhappen as many as 200 times at night. Those with sleep apnea tend to have higher than normal blood\npressure, are more likely to have strokes, and are at greater risk of heart disease. These people also have\na higher incidence of emotional and psychotic problems.\nOvereating, eating too close to bedtime, and eating bad food can produce sleeplessness or insomnia.\nSystemic disorders in the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, lungs, digestive organs, endocrines, and brain\ncan all affect sleep.",

      "overview": "- A lack of calcium and magnesium can cause you to wake up after a few hours and be\nunable to return to sleep.\n- Eat nutritious food, and let breakfast and lunch be your main meals. Only eat lightly in\nthe evening, and several hours before bedtime.\n- Foods with the amino acid, tryptophane, promotes sleep. These include figs, dates, and\nwhole grain crackers.\n- Avoid cheese, bacon, chocolate, ham, sausage, and wine before bedtime. Better yet, keep\nthose junk foods entirely out of your diet. Do not eat eggplant, sauerkraut, potatoes, sugar,\nspinach, or tomatoes before retiring. All the foods in this paragraph contain tyramine,\nwhich increases the release of norepinephrine, a brain stimulant.\n- Other foods which keep people awake include fatty foods, sugar, white flour, salt,\nmonosodium glutamate (MSG), chemical preservatives, additives, and allergenic foods.\n- Obtain enough exercise during the day, with some of it being out-of-doors. Exercise\nregularly in the late afternoon or early evening, but not right before bedtime.\n- Before bedtime go outside and walk around quietly in the fresh air for 30 to 45 minutes.\n- Take a hot bath (not a shower) an hour or two before bedtime.\n- Some people need to have the bedroom quiet. Others need some sound to mask\nbackground noise. In such cases, have a fan turned on.\n- Trust in God. He promises to give His beloved rest.\n- Regularity in your habits is important. This is vital to good sleep. Always go to bed at\nthe same time, and get up at a definite time. The body has normal rhythmic cycles. People\nwith regular habits have faster reaction time and are happier than those with irregular\nsleeping times. Getting up each morning at the right time will help you go to sleep at the\nright time each night. Sleeping in, on weekends, disrupts the biological clock. If you want\nsleep problems, stay up late every so often.\n- For some people, daytime naps make it more difficult to sleep at night. But, for some\nolder people, a little rest before mealtime during the day helps them, so that any\nsleeplessness at night never fatigues them.\n- If you cannot sleep, you can just lay there, relax, and rest. This is nearly as good as\nsleep.\n- Or you can get up and do something quietly and calmly for a short time—and then go\nback to bed and to sleep. One excellent method is to go outside and breath the fresh air,\nlook up at the stars, breath some more fresh air—and then go back to bed and to sleep.\n- If you are wakeful one night, do not nap the next day, and you will be more likely to go\nright to sleep that night.\n- Go to bed early when you are sleepy.\n- Some take melatonin or calcium to help them go to sleep. These are both natural and\nsafe aids in promoting sleep.\n- The room temperature should be 60o-65o F. If the room is too warm, you are more likely\nto move about more and awaken more frequently. The problem is a lack of air.\n- If you want a restful night's sleep, make sure a little current of air is passing through\nyour room, even in the winter. But you cannot sleep well when it is stuffy.\n- Do not take sleeping pills. They have pain relievers, bromides, antihistamines, and/or\nscopolamine. These are ineffective and produce unpleasant side effects.\n- Alcohol, barbiturates, and hypnotics do not solve the sleep problem, but worsen it.\nAlcohol disrupts sleep later in the night. Nicotine appears to be calming, but it is actually\na neuro-stimulant.\n- Do not take caffeine substances after lunch.\n- Do not take nasal decongestants and other cold medications. They stimulate many\npeople and keep them from getting to sleep.\n- Restless leg syndrome (which see) can be a problem. Calcium, potassium, magnesium,\nand zinc supplements help eliminate that problem. In addition, make sure you are not\nanemic. (See anemia).\n- Studies reveal that, in countries where people regularly nap during the day, there are less\naccidents, and productivity is higher. The important factor here is consistency. Be regular\nin your hours for sleep at night. If you nap during the day, be regular in that. If you nap,\ngenerally keep your naps short—less than an hour at a time.\n- Herbal teas which help increase sleepiness include hop tea, catnip, and chamomile. But\ndo not rely on herb tea, to help get you to sleep every night.\n- Make sure you have a good mattress to sleep on.\n- Keep your thoughts heavenward, and you will find it much easier to go to sleep at night.\n—Also see \"Insomnia—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Every faculty with which the Creator has endowed us should be cultivated to\nthe highest degree of perfection, that we may be able to do the greatest amount of good of which we are\ncapable.\nINSOMNIA—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nTO RELIEVE BRAIN CONGESTION—Neutral Douche, 3-5 minutes at bedtime; Cold Douche; Hot\nLeg Bath; Footbath under running water; heating Wet Sheet Pack, followed by Wet Sheet Rub; Hot\nAbdominal Pack, warmly covered and protected with plastic; heating Leg Pack; dry heat to the legs and\nfeet; Hot Leg Pack followed by Cold Mitten Friction to the legs; Heating Compress to legs or Leg Pack\nat bedtime, to be prolonged during the night; Hot Abdominal Pack and Leg Pack through the night;\nRevulsive Douche to the legs at 102o F. for 2 minutes, then 60o F. for 15 seconds; Neutral Douche, 3-5\nminutes; downward stroking of head and neck [to eliminate phlegm and aid lymph flow].\nRELIEVE IRRITABILITY OF THE BRAIN CELLS—Prolonged Neutral Bath at bedtime; neutral\nWet Sheet Pack; Enema, if constipation or flatulence are present.\nIRRITABILITY OF SOLAR PLEXUS OR LOWER BACK NERVES—Abdominal Fomentation\nfollowed by abdominal Heating Compress, changing every 6 hours. Avoid eating anything but fruits\nafter 4 p.m. Copious water drinking. Colonic, especially if the bowels are inactive, as constipation is a\nfrequent cause of insomnia by producing irritation of the abdominal sympathetic nerves.\nEXCESSIVE CARDIAC ACTIVITY—Ice Bag over heart.\nFIDGETINESS OR RESTLESSNESS—Warm Pail Pour to spine, at 95o-98o F. Tepid Sponging;\nrubbing of limbs; rubbing of spine; massage of head.\nGENERAL IRRITABILITY—Neutral Wet Sheet Pack; Neutral Full Bath; Neutral fan Douche or\nShower, for 2-4 minutes.\nGENERAL METHOD—There may be said to be three forms of insomnia: Sleeplessness may be due to\n(1) congestion of the brain, (2) irritability of the brain cells, or (3) a combination of these two conditions.\nHere is how to go to sleep: (1) Come to God, and in peace of heart, trust in Him. (2) Relax and let your\nmind rest; do not try to problem-solve, you just gave them all to Jesus. (3) Check the temperature and\nair; it is more difficult to go to sleep in a room that is too hot, too cold, too drafty, or one lacking fresh\nair. (4) With your nerves and muscles relaxed and cheerful in the thought of Jesus' love, concentrate on\nbreathing slightly deeper, and go to sleep.\n—Also see \"Insomnia—1.\"\nVERTIGO (Dizziness)\nSYMPTOMS—Dizziness, faintness, or light-headedness. The person may feel that he is falling or\nsinking or that the room is moving around him, sometimes even spinning. This sensation is usually\naccompanied by nausea, vomiting, perspiration, headache, or hearing loss.\nCAUSES—Vertigo is caused by an impaired sense of balance and equilibrium, and is generally due to\nan inner ear problem. Older people have it more often than those younger.\nIf the original cause is concussion, skull fracture, or injuring the inner ear, the dizziness may occur long\nafter the injury supposedly healed.\nOther causes are anemia, brain tumors, high or low blood pressure, psychological stress, lack of oxygen\nor glucose in the blood, nutritional deficiencies, viral infection, fever, changes in atmospheric pressure,\nthe use of certain drugs, middle ear infections, excess wax in the ear, or blockage of the ear canal or\neustachian tube.\nLower oxygen levels at higher altitudes can also cause it. Another cause is vitamin B and niacin\n6\ndeficiency.\nYou can expect that you may temporarily experience it if you engage in certain activities, such as\namusement park rides, sailing, or virtual reality games.\nBe aware that dizziness can be a warning sign of a coming heart attack or stroke. It can also be an\nindication that a concussion has just occurred.\nDizziness is not the same as vertigo. From time to time, anyone can experience some dizziness or\nfaintness. Those with low-blood pressure will frequently experience this when standing up suddenly.",

Vitamin C is also important.\n- Do not take over 2,000 mg of total sodium per day.

      "overview": "Find out what your ongoing problems are and solve them. Problems are like a wall; you can go through\nthem, go over them, or go around them. You go through a problem when you eliminate it. You surmount\nan immediate problem when you figure out a way to sidestep it and still do what is needed. You go\naround it when you learn to live with an ongoing situation you cannot solve. You stop worrying about it\nor letting it bother you, and turn your attention to other things.\nHere are several basic suggestions:\n- Think positive in every situation. See a good side to it, and learn to make the best of it.\nSee it as an interesting challenge to solve difficulties. Trust in God to help you weather\nevery crisis and carry on through to the end.\nThink about something else for a time. That will help your brain to rest and your emotions\nto calm down. Gradually answers will come to mind.\n- Counsel with a good friend. If it is a problem with your husband, counsel with a woman,\nnot with a man. The same holds true for a man.\n- The primary problems in a person's life are employment, spouse, money, children,\ndeadlines, and guilt.\n- Sometimes you need to temporarily leave a threatening situation and get away and calm\ndown, take time to pray and rest your mind.\n- Stretching your muscles can help move a circulation made sluggish by the situation, so\nyou can think better. Massage muscles which have tensed up. Drop your jaw and move it\nleft to right. This helps relax the jaw muscle.\n- Take a hot bath; that really relaxes you, so you can start thinking constructively again.\n- Go outside and walk in the open air. Hold your head up, breath deeply, and relax.\n- Many times, the underlying need is to go to God and ask forgiveness, obey His Ten\nCommandment law, and start living a new, clean life. Make things right with those you\nhave wronged.\n- Believe that, with God's help, the situation can be dealt with. Keep trusting Him as a\nlittle child trusts his parent to lead him by the hand across a busy street.\n- A change in diet is needed to help restore a sickly immune system. Fresh fruit and\nvegetables, especially raw vegetables. Kelp or dulse, and raw seeds or nuts. Be sure and\ntake enough vitamin C, as well as a full range of supplementary vitamins and minerals.\n- The following herbs are helpful: ginkgo, echinacea, dong quai, gotu kola, bilberry, milk\nthistle, catnip, chamomile, hops, skullcap, and valerian. Take them separately or mix 2-3\ntogether, and take as a tea.\nENCOURAGEMENT—If you would find happiness and peace in all you do, you must do everything\nin reference to the glory of God. Seek earnestly to imitate the life of Christ, so others will be helped\ntoward the pathway to heaven.\nHEADACHE—1 (Nervous Headaches; Cluster Headaches)\nSYMPTOMS—A pain or ache in any portion of the head.\nCluster headaches: Often occurs as a one-sided headache which comes on suddenly, causes debilitating\npain, and comes and goes in severity.\nCAUSES—Over 45 million Americans repeatedly have headaches. About 18 million have migraines.\nCommon causes of headaches include eyestrain, tension, poor ventilation (lack of fresh air), sinus\npressure, constipation, allergies (food, pollens, chemicals, etc.), stress, anxiety, muscle tension,\ninfection, anemia, hunger, fever, hormonal imbalances, trauma to the head, nutritional deficiencies,\nsinusitis, alcohol, drugs, tobacco, spinal misalignment, temporomandibular joint syndrome, or airborne\npollutants and chemicals (perfume, industrial fumes, etc.). Diseases of the eyes, nose, or throat can also\nproduce them. Niacin or pantothenic acid deficiency, an overdose of vitamin A, a vitamin B deficiency,\nor disturbances of the digestive or circulatory system can bring them on. Birth control pills can also\ncause headaches (by causing a vitamin B deficiency).\n6\nThe headache may be caused by a reaction to a certain food, such as chocolate, wheat, sugar,\nmonosodium glutamate (MSG), dairy products, hot dogs, luncheon meats, citric acid, vinegar, or\nmarinated foods. Sulfites, found in certain foods, can do it. Fermented foods, such as sour cream, yogurt,\nand cheeses can do it also.\nThere are three important subtypes of headaches. Emotional stress is an important cause in all of them:\nNervous headaches. These are muscle contraction headaches. The experts tell us that 90% of all\nheadaches are caused by tension, worry about problems, conflicts with others, etc. Nervousness causes\nthe muscles to tighten up.\nCluster headaches. These are severe, recurring headaches. These are also called histamine headaches,\nand are related to allergic reactions. Inhalant allergens may be a cause (including perfume, house dust,\ncigarette smoke, etc.). They may occur by themselves or be associated with other problems and diseases,\nincluding chronic fatigue syndrome (which see). Keep a diet diary. Ninety percent of those with cluster\nheadaches are men.",

      "overview": "- When a headache comes, apply cold compresses to the place where the pain seems to be\noriginating. This reduces muscle spasms and constricts blood vessels. Leave a damp\nwashcloth in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or dip the cloth in water with ice cubes, wring\nit out, and apply. Also take an enema.\n- Place a heating pad, hot towel, or hot water bottle on the shoulder muscles, and possibly\non the neck. Do that which helps you best.\n- Get enough sleep.\n- Do not overeat. Include enough fiber in your meals and take an enema weekly.\n- The treatment for headache depends on the underlying cause. Headaches caused by a\ncertain problem frequently return. So identify what is causing them and many future\nheadaches will never occur.\n- Sometimes repeated headaches are a symptom of a serious disorder.\n- Make sure you are taking enough B vitamins, especially niacin and pantothenic acid.\nVitamin A and iron are also important (but be sure and get your iron from food, such as\nblackstrap molasses, not from chemical supplements).\n- Consider the lists, given above under \"causes.\"\n- Regular exercise can help prevent tension headaches. Exercise when it occurs, but do not\nexercise if it is severe.\n- Get enough sleep, but do not oversleep.\n- Eat on time, and do not eat problem foods.\n- Stand tall; sit tall.\n- Breathe deeply.\n- Bright light can cause squinting, eyestrain, and headaches.\n- Do not chew gum. The repetitive chewing can bring on a tension headache.\n- Do not use much salt.\n- Do not overdo. Learn to live within your limits.\n- When you have to face high altitudes, take additional vitamin C, to avoid a high-altitude\nheadache.\nWhat are sometimes thought to be sinus headaches are actually tension headaches, migraines, or cluster\nheadaches. When the headache is recurring, it is probably not sinus trouble.\n- Keep a diary, to help you determine the cause of the headaches. Note date, time of day,\nwhere the pain is felt, and any comments about what you think might be possible causes.\n- If any of the following symptoms occur with the headache, the situation may be more\nserious and you may want to consult a professional: fever and stiffness in the neck,\nsensitivity to light, loss of speech or confusion, throbbing of the head and temples,\npounding heartbeat, pressure in the facial sinus area, visual color changes, or a feeling that\nyour head may explode.\n- If you think that something you just ate might bring on a terrible headache, take 5\ncharcoal tablets within an hour; and, as soon as you can, take an enema. (But do not take\ncharcoal tablets daily.)\n- Helpful herbs include valerian, feverfew, balm, fleabane, cowslip, lavender, and white\nwillow.\nThere are many types of headaches. Here are a few of them:\n- Nervous tension headaches: Continual pain in one area or many, with sore muscles in\nneck and upper back, plus lightheadedness and dizziness. Treatment of this most common\nof headaches includes application of ice packs on neck and upper back. Take extra vitamin\nC and P (bioflavonoids). Avoid sugar, caffeine, food allergens, stress. Get enough\nexercise.\n- Cluster headaches: Strong, throbbing pain on one side of head, tearing of eyes, flushing\nof face, congestion of nose. May occur 1-3 times a day for weeks or months. Take enough\nprotein, avoid inhalant allergens, and keep a diet diary.\n- Hangover headache: This headache has throbbing pain, and is caused by drinking liquor.\nPut ice on the neck and drink lots of water and fruit juices. Stop drinking alcohol.\n- Exertion headache: This headache is caused by physical exertion or sexual excess.\nApply ice packs to the point of pain, improve the diet, and stop the excesses.\n- Caffeine headache: It is a throbbing pain, and happens when you try to quit your coffee\naddiction too fast. Drink a small amount of coffee, to stop the headache and then gradually\nkeep getting away from this addiction.\n- Sinus headache: A nagging pain to the right and left of the nose and over it. Apply moist\nheat, to reduce sinus trouble (see \"Sinus Trouble\"), and take more vitamin C.\n- Bilious headache: The temples throb, and there is a dull headache in the forehead. It is\ncaused by overeating, wrong eating, and inactivity. Take an enema; then change your diet\nand get more exercise.\n- Menstrual headache: A headache which feels like a migraine (which see), and occurs at\nmenstruation or during ovulation. Take potassium, magnesium, and vitamin B .\n6\n- Hunger headache: A general headache which occurs just before mealtime, and is caused\nby skipping meals or excessive dieting. Eat better meals, which include complex\ncarbohydrates and protein, to help carry you to the next meal.\n- Eyestrain headache: Pain in the frontal lobes, just behind the eyes. Many think this is\ncaused by uncorrected vision problems, but it can also be caused by too much brain work\nat late hours. Change your way of life; perhaps you need a change in eyeglasses.\n- Arthritis headache: Pain at the back of the head or neck, which increases with\nmovement. Feverfew herb teas are recommended, but not during pregnancy.\n- Hypertension headache: A dull pain over much of the head, increased by movement.\nLower your blood pressure.\n—Also see \"Headache—2\" and \"Migraine\" for more suggestions.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Holiness is an entire surrender of the will to God; it is living by every word\nthat proceeds from the mouth of God; it is doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in\ntrial, in darkness as well as in light; it is relying on God with unquestioning confidence; it is resting in\nHis love.\nHEADACHE—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nNOTE—The following grouping of headaches is made for practical convenience.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Generalized or one-sided head pain and possibly nausea, vomiting, and visual\ndisturbances (light sensitivity, bright spots and patterns before the eyes). It might last for days. The first\nsign is frequent flashes of light or tingling. There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cyanosis\n(blueness) of the fingers from lack of circulation and oxygen. The pain is most common in the temple,\nbut may occur anywhere on the head, face, or neck. The pain is frequently on one side, but it may\nchange to the opposite side, alternate sides, or be on both sides.\nCAUSES—These are caused by a disturbance in the blood circulation. There is alternating constriction\nand dilation of the blood vessels in the brain, and occurs between the ages of 10-30, more often in\nwomen (70%) than men. Food allergies are frequently the cause. Search them out. Here are six of the\nmost common causes: food allergy, low blood sugar, tension, depression, water retention, and\nmenstruation. There often are no migraines during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, or after\nmenopause is past.\nMigraines can disappear for years and then reappear. They usually decrease after middle age.\nOver 50% of those with migraines report that one or both parents also had the problem.",

      "overview": "- Resting in a darkened room with an ice cap to the head is helpful. There may first be an\nincrease of pain, but within three minutes, the symptoms may disappear, except for a mild\nheadache.\n- As soon as one begins, if possible, take an enema. This will help stop the attack.\n- When an attack begins, try wrapping something tight about the head.\n- When it is a throbbing pain, place light pressure on the arteries of the neck for a few\nseconds at a time.\n- Vigorous daily out-of-door exercise helps decrease attacks.\n- Maintain a regular schedule. Too much sleep, too little sleep, missed meals, etc., may\ntrigger an attack. Do not sleep in late. Some people must avoid naps during the day.\n- It is thought that 25% of migraines trace their cause to food allergies (see \"Allergies\").\nVarious studies have identified the following causes: cola drinks, chocolate, pork, corn,\nonion, garlic, eggs, tea, citrus, wheat, coffee, cane sugar, yeast, beef, alcohol, cheese, fried\nfoods, seafood, mushrooms, and peas.\n- Eliminate any suspected food from your diet for five days, and see if that helped solve\nthe problem.\n- Chills can induce migraines. Tiredness, anxiety, or eating late also can. Other causes\ninclude antibiotics, high-salt diet, odors and inhalants, tobacco smoke, caffeine, refined\ncarbohydrates, fatty fried foods, emotional stress and resentment, and allergy shots.\n- Exposure to sunlight triggers migraines in some people. They cannot take the bright light\nin their eyes. Staying in the shade on bright days does not cause this problem.\n- The amino acid, tyrosine, produces a breakdown product, called tyramine. Tyramine is a\nsignificant cause of migraine headaches. It does this by releasing norepinephrine from\nbrain tissue, which causes constriction of scalp and brain blood vessels.\n- Any substance which has undergone bacterial decomposition (such as cheese) has high\nlevels of tyramine. Other foods with it include plums, oranges, bananas, raspberries, and\navocados.\n—See \"Migraine—2.\" Also see \"Headache\" and \"Headache—2\" for many more suggestions.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We must take hold of divine power, and with determination resist the\ntemptations of Satan. Through the enabling strength which Christ provides, we can be more than\nconquerors in the battle with evil.\nMIGRAINE—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nPREVENT FORMATION OF URIC ACID—Avoid use of meats, also tea and coffee, etc.; aseptic\ndietary; out-of-door life.\nELIMINATE URIC ACID—Hot Baths, especially moderately prolonged sweating baths, followed by\nshort Cold Baths; Radiant Heat Bath; Wet Sheet Pack; Steam Bath; prolonged Neutral Bath; water\ndrinking.\nLOWER ARTERIAL TENSION—Hot Full Bath at 1020 F., 5-10 minutes; Hot Leg Bath or Hot Leg\nPack; Hot Enema; rest in bed in a darkened room.\nPAIN—Hot Footbath; Alternate Compress to spine or sponging of spine; Revulsive Compress to seat of\npain; local application of Ice Bag in some cases; Hot Leg Pack; protect the eyes from light.\nNAUSEA AND VOMITING—Ice pills, ice to stomach and the spine opposite the stomach.\nCONSTIPATION—Colonic.\nTO PREVENT ATTACK—Fruit diet; large colonic; water drinking.\nTO RELIEVE HYPERESTHESIA OF LOWER BACK NERVES—Fomentation over abdomen,\ntwice daily; continuous Heating Compress during the interval between; abdominal supporter.\nGENERAL METHOD—Every case is curable by sufficiently prolonged treatment, carefully managed.\nThe general nervous system must be built up by measures essentially the same as those indicated for\nneurasthenia and other conditions requiring tonic treatment. The causes must be removed, especially\nautointoxication and morbid reflex influences arising from dilation of the stomach, enteroptosis, and\nindigestion.\n—Also see \"Migraine—1.\"",

This can be a heating pad or a hot shower.\nHere are several longer-range solutions:\n- Do neck exercises each day, to stretch your neck muscles and strengthen them.\n- To stretch those muscles, slowly tilt your head forward and back and turn from side to\nside.\n- To strengthen them, put your hand on the side of your head and push. Then do the other\nside, and then the back and front. Hold light weights (3-5 pounds) in your hands, keeping\nyour arms straight while shrugging your shoulders.\n- Sit in chairs which give you good back support.\n- Sit up, not forward.

Arrange your work so\nyou can look forward, and not downward, most of the time.\n- Stop every so often and take a break.\n- Always lift heavy things carefully with the legs and not the back.\n- Sleep on a firm mattress.\n- Do not sleep on your stomach, but, better, on your side or on your back.\n- Keep your neck warm when you are outside in the cold.\n- You may do better with a smaller pillow or no pillow at all.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God that there is hope for each one of us! In Christ we can have the\nvictory over every temptation, and come off more than conquerors. Trust in Him and He will carefully\nguide you step by step.\nNEURALGIA—1 (Neuropathy)\nSYMPTOMS—Pain which comes on suddenly, followed by intervals of freedom from pain. The pains\nare severe and seem to shoot along the course of the affected nerves. The nerve trunks become tender to\npressure. In severe cases, there is twitching of the muscles of the affected part, with burning and tingling\nsensations in the skin. The attacks are rarely on both sides of the body at the same time. They generally\ncontinue from a few minutes to a few days, and may occur frequently for months. As time passes, the\nattacks tend to become more severe.\nCAUSES—Neuralgia is nerve pain; neuritis (which see) is nerve inflammation.\nNeuralgia is an irritation of a nerve which can be caused by many factors, including trauma, nutritional\ndeficiencies, herpes, shingles, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or alcoholism.\nChilling an area of the skin is a frequent underlying cause, as well as nutritional deficiencies including\nthe B complex (especially B , B , folic acid, pantothenic acid, and B ).\n1 6 12\nOther causes include decayed teeth, wrong diet, constipation, tension, insomnia, fatigue, exposure, lack\nof exercise, sinus infections, and eye strain.\nA frequent cause of the problem in the various forms of neuralgia is chilling of part of the body over a\nperiod of time, when the rest of the body is relatively warm. This is most likely to occur in the winter\nmonths, when you are in bed sleeping. A current of cold air is passing across your face, and the rest of\nyour body is tucked under the covers.\nThe result is tic douloureux (which see) or Bell's palsy (which see) on the face or neck or, if the\nshoulders are uncovered, neuralgia of the shoulder or some other area.\nThe cause can also occur as a result of regular commute driving. A window is kept open slightly to\nprovide fresh air but a slight chilling breeze blows on the face for perhaps a total of an hour each day.\nThe formula for trouble is (1) chilling draft to part of the body while the rest is warm (2) over a period of\nseveral hours, (3) day after day.\nNow that you are aware of the cause, watch closely the situations you place your body in each day—and\nyou will probably find the cause.",

One side of the face can droop.\nCAUSES—Bell's palsy is a type of paralysis characterized by distortion of the face, due to a lesion of\nthe facial nerve.\nIt may be caused by injury, irritation of a sensory nerve, or nerve root. A decayed tooth may be the\ncause. Chilling of the face at night while one is sleeping can also produce it; the blood has been chilled\nback from the area. Sometimes Bell's palsy follows a respiratory infection.\nBell's palsy is often mistaken for a stroke, because it comes on suddenly and results in numbness and\npartial, or total, loss of muscular control on the affected side. But it is not a stroke.\nTreated properly, there can be as much as 80% chance of significant recovery—all those with partial\npalsy and three fourths of those with complete palsy recover with no treatment of any kind. Because\nmost of those with this problem recover spontaneously, they should not be given drugs or surgery.\nBut severe taste impairment and/or reduced tearing of the eyes are bad signs, especially in older people.\nBell's palsy can occur in anyone at any age, but most frequently occurs between 20 and 40, often in the\nsummer months (especially August). The younger the person is the more likely he will have a full\nrecovery.",

When this happens, the chilled part does not receive adequate rest. A\nnerve in the face or neck can become chilled and cause problems.\n- Apply warm, wet washcloths twice a day, for 20 minutes at a time, to relieve pain and\ntenseness. Follow with gentle massage both backward and upward.\n- Apply pure water to the affected eye 4 times a day, to keep it moist and free from dust.\nWearing sunglasses will reduce evaporation from that eye.

    "fields": {
      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Pain is noted down the back of the thigh, the outer side of the calf and along the outer\nside of the foot, or on the top of the foot to the big toe. The person compensates by placing more weight\non the other leg and foot. The pain is often worse at night and coughing, walking, heavy labor, or\nsneezing increases both the pain in the back and in the sciatic nerve.\nStill later, numbness may be felt when the hand is rubbed over the area where the pain is felt.\nLater still, a wasting of the muscles of the calf and a weakness in running and even walking may be\nnoticed.\nCAUSES—The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve comes out of the spine and a\nbranch runs down each leg, along the back of the thigh, down the inside of the leg, to the ankle.\nThere are two primary causes of sciatica:\nThe first is chilling the thigh over a lengthy period of time. The experts tell us that sciatica usually\nbegins as a neuralgia of the sciatic nerve. If you sit on cold surfaces a lot (steel folding chairs in cool\nrooms, or steel tree chairs while hunting, or steel boat seats while fishing, etc.) for lengthy periods of\ntime, you can irritate the sciatic nerve and produce sciatica.\nFortunately, this form of sciatica is quite easy to solve: Apply neuralgia-type treatments, and only sit on\nwarm surfaces or surfaces your body can heat relatively easily. Do not overlook chairs with foam that\nare too deep to easily warm up within a short time (say, 8 inches).\nOn your favorite chairs, place a folded, wool blanket or a piled thinner blanket. That is something you\ncan warm up. Experiment, and see what works best for you. If your body does not begin warming it up\nin a few minutes, lay something down that will.\nUnfortunately, there is a second, and much more serious, cause:\nThe second cause of sciatica is damage to the lower spine. There may be a history of an accident, a fall,\nthe lifting of a heavy weight, or a twist under some tension. Pain was first felt in the lower back. Later\n(weeks or even years later) pain begins to be felt at one or more places along the entire course of the\nsciatic nerve—back of the thigh, outer side of the calf, or in the top of the foot to the big toe.\nOne of the cartilaginous plates (disks, also spelled discs) in the lumbar region of the lower back has been\ndamaged. The cartilage bulges and later breaks, creating pressure backward against a nerve root. (It is\nalso possible for a tumor to develop and press against the sciatic nerve, but this is far less likely.)\nOther important facts are these: (1) The person probably was not maintaining a nourishing diet, with\nsupplemental calcium, and other bone-building factors. (2) He may have been overworking his body in\nrunning, weight-lifting, etc. (3) He was not lifting objects properly. (4) He was working at an\noccupation, such as lifting heavy patients in a nursing home, which is hazardous.\nIn older people who do not obtain enough bone-building materials in their diet, degenerative problems\ncan occur in newly formed spicules, or ridges, of bone. These may press on a nerve root.\nSome people derange their lower back by the simple method of always carrying a thick wallet in one\npants back pocket.",

Do each exercise 3 times, 2-3 times a day, increasing the number as\nimprovement occurs:\n- Pull the knees up as close to the chin as possible. You will feel a pulling sensation in the\nlower back.\n- Sitting in a chair, reach under it as far as possible, and bend from the hip only.\n- While laying on the back, the leg is raised with the knee straight. Someone else raises the\nleg, bending it from the hip only. This stretches the sciatic nerve and the hamstring\nmuscles.\n- If the attack of pain lasts so long that the leg muscles have lost considerable strength,\nmassage and a daily hot and cold leg bath (cold after the painful period is over) will help\nto restore circulation and strength.\n- There are times when a back adjustment helps. If the back is out of adjustment, this pain\ncan occur. You will want to weigh this possibility carefully.\n- Fast one day a week, and eat only raw food for a month.\n- Have a good foot massage every 3 days and especially around the Achilles tendons, up\nthe back of the ankles.\n- Add 2 cups of salt to a boiling quart of water. When quite warm, apply with a cloth to\nthe area until relief comes.\n- Get fresh air, sunlight, and, if possible, moderate exercise.\nAlso apply the preventative measures, below.\n- If no improvement results from home treatments, you may wish to consult a specialist.\nHe is likely to tell you that an operation is necessary. Should you have an operation on\nyour spine? Carefully read the article, \"Backache,\" for additional information on the entire\nsubject.\nPreventative measures: If you identify the problem early on, there may be greater likelihood of\ncontaining or eliminating it.\n- Taking vitamin B complex is very important for healthy nerves. Taking supplemental\ncalcium, magnesium, silica, and vitamin D for the bones is also important. Read the article\non \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\n- Be careful of your back when you work!\n—Read \"Bones, Strengthening\" for much information. Also read \"Backache\" for detailed information on\nback trouble. Also read \"Neuralgia,\" since sciatica is a form of it.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The Saviour overcame to show man how he may overcome. Christ met all the\ntemptations of Satan with the Word of God. By trusting in God's promises, He received power to obey\nGod's commandments, and the tempter could gain no advantage. So it is to be with us.\nBRACHIAL NEURALGIA (Thoracic Outlet Syndrome)\nSYMPTOMS—One to three hours after falling asleep, there is a sense of pins, needles, numbness, and\npain in one or both hands. The discomfort generally wakes the person. There may be wasting in the\nsmall muscles in the hands, as well as coldness or swelling. It generally occurs among adults, not\nchildren.\nThe symptoms can eventually include the lower arm, upper arm, and even the shoulder, and are\ngenerally worse after a day of heavy lifting.\nDuring the day few symptoms are present, unless heavy lifting occurs.\nCAUSES—This is to the shoulder, what sciatica is to the leg. A nerve, leading to the shoulder, is\npinched in the spine.\nBut it can also be caused by overworking of the arms, carrying excessively heavy weights, poor posture,\nand letting the arms and hands get cold at night. More rarely, there may be an abnormality in the seventh\ncervical rib.\nThe lower branch of the brachial plexus of nerves exits from the lower cervical vertebrae, then passes\nunderneath the clavicle and on into the arm. If this somehow experiences compression, the nerves to the\narm and hand will be affected.\nIt is best to solve this problem, since it is likely otherwise to gradually keep getting worse.\nA similar affliction is called the cervical rib syndrome. But it occurs more often in younger people, and\nproduces pain or numbness soon after heavy lifting, wearing a heavy coat, etc. The symptoms occur in\nthe day, not at night.",

      "overview": "BUILDING UP THE NERVES—Good blood, healthy nerves, and strong bones and joints are needed\nfor good health. Here are several suggestions, to help you strengthen your nerves. This is a building\nprogram:\nThe vitamin B complex (100 mg per day; best taken as 50 mg twice a day) is especially important in\nmaintaining good nerve action and response. Deficiencies of the B complex are common among people\neating modern, devitalized, processed, and assorted junk foods. Take a good vitamin/mineral supplement\nat least twice a day. It should include all the B vitamins.\nVitamin B , also called thiamine (100 mg, twice a day) is especially needed for neuritis.\n1\nVitamin B (niacin, 50 mg twice a day). Do not take more than 100 mg of niacin a day. Niacinamide is\n3\nequivalent to niacin, and does not produce the flushed face which niacin does.\nVitamin B (2,000 mcg, twice a day).\n12\nVitamin B (250-500 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for carpal tunnel syndrome.\n6\nFolic acid (400-800 mcg, daily).\nInositol (1000 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for diabetic neuropathy.\nIn addition to the above B vitamins, also take Vitamin C with bioflavonoids (3,000-6,000 mg daily,\nwhen you have a nerve crisis).\nVitamin E (400 IU, 2-3 times a day), especially with post-herpes syndrome.\nVitamin A (5,000 IU, a day), but not over 10,000 IU a day if you are pregnant. It is best to take vitamin\nA supplementation in the form of beta-carotene.\nMinerals include calcium (400 mg, 2-3 times daily), magnesium (200 mg, 2-3 times a day), zinc (50-80\nmg daily, not to exceed 100 mg daily from all supplements), and iodine.\nEssential fatty acids, obtained from 1-2 tbsp. of cold pressed oils daily. Never put it into your cooking;\ninstead, put it on your food after the plate is served.\nFresh and steamed vegetables are rich in minerals which are needed for the nervous system and brain.\nBrewer's yeast, kelp or dulse, lecithin, and wheat germ oil are very helpful.

It helps the neuron membranes.\nIncrease your fluid intake.\nObtain enough rest at night and avoid sexual enervation. Medical professionals know that such\nenervation is one of the quickest ways to produce weakened, degenerate, and diseased nerve tissue.\nA good balance between exercise and rest has a powerful effect in building the body, if a nutritious diet\nis maintained.\nAvoid stimulants and all processed, refined, and junk foods.\nCool and cold water treatments will help tone and strengthen the nerves.\nThe nervine herbs include skullcap, hop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, passion flower,\nlady's slipper, mistletoe, and small amounts of lobelia.\nReviewing some of the nutrients needed, as they apply to the brain, we learn this:\nThere is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is clogged, mental\nillness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in others.\nEliminate the \"glue foods\"; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous and toxins in it,\nand lead to mental problems. Such foods include White flour, sugar, eggs, meat, peanuts, and dairy\nproducts.\nA high carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the brain, and produces\na calming, peaceful feeling.\nBrain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients.\nDeficiencies of the B complex and vitamin C decrease the metabolic rate of the brain. Lack of niacin can\nproduce deep depression, often seen in psychosis. Symptoms of a severe vitamin B deficiency are\n6\nheadache, irritability, dizziness, extreme nervousness, and inability to concentrate. Pantothenic acid\n(another B vitamin) is needed to handle stressful situations. A thiamine deficiency results in a lack of\nenergy, constant fatigue, loss of appetite, and irritability; if this continues too long, there are emotional\nupsets and overreaction to normal stress. Lack of vitamin C leads to irritability.\nAdequate calcium in the diet is vital. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for ways to maintain enough calcium\nin the body. Inadequate calcium results in insomnia, tenseness, and fatigue.\nCalcium and magnesium protect the nerves from damage.\nToo much copper in the body occurs in schizophrenia, and can be reduced by dietary intake of zinc and\nmanganese. Vitamin C deficiency can cause copper retention which accumulates in the brain and liver.\nVitamin B complex (especially B , B , B and folic acid) reduces excess estrogen from the liver and\n3 6 12,\nprevents it from causing mental troubles.\nMany of the schizophrenias, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning disorders are caused\nby too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes. Plastic water pipes are the safest.\nA person with a magnesium deficiency tends to be uncooperative, withdraw, apathetic, or belligerent.\nIt is vital to obtain enough oxygen, if you want a clear mind which functions properly. Vitamin E helps\nthe brain obtain enough oxygen from the amount supplied to the lungs.\nA lack of thyroxine, the hormone from the thyroid, results in a slowing of physical and mental functions.\nHyperthyroidism is related to emotional disturbance, forgetfulness, slow thought processes, and\nirritability.\nWhen the adrenals do not function properly, depression and other forms of mental illness may result.\nExercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps rejuvenate the body\nand mind.\nGinkgo biloba improves brain function and cerebral circulation, and enhances memory.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We have been bought with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without\nblemish.

The\ntendons need to be strengthened. Purchase a hand gripper at a sporting goods store, and\nslowly increase your usage of it until you are using it 5-10 minutes, 4 times a day. When\nyou use it, the elbow should be straight and the wrist bent. This will stretch the extensor\ntendons and help strengthen the fibrous tendons.\n- Other exercises are also helpful. Place your forearm on a table, palm down, and grip a 3pound dumbbell. Flex the wrist upward slightly; hold for 5 seconds, lower and rest for 3\nseconds. When you can easily do this 15 times, increase the weight by 1 pound. Over a\nperiod of 4-6 weeks of doing this every day, you may be able to move up to 8-10 pounds\nlifted without pain. Medical Tribune (January 12, 1977) reported that 14 of 18 patients, on\na four-week program with this exercise, obtained complete pain relief.\n- Athletes sometimes place a band several inches wide around the forearm near the elbow,\nand another just above the wrist.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Mild numbness and faint tingling to excruciating pain, but generally only burning,\ntingling, or numbness in the thumb and first three fingers. Crippling atrophy of the thumb can result.\nSymptoms are often worse at night or in the morning. The pain may eventually spread to the arm and\nshoulder. Symptoms normally affect only one hand, but may be present in both.\nCAUSES—Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a cumulative trauma disorder that develops over time, due\nto repeated stressful movements of the hands and wrist. It affects 23,000 workers a year. The median\nnerve in the wrist is compressed or damaged. This nerve controls the thumb muscles and sensation in the\nthumb, palm, and first three fingers. The median nerve passes through a very small opening, about a\nquarter inch below the top of the wrist.\nEither compression or injury to this nerve can cause problems: Pressure from the bone spurs\ninflammatory arthritis or tendonitis, swelling due to pregnancy or water retention.\nOther causes include repeated stressful motions, such as writing, typing, or hammering. Bookkeepers\nand checkout clerks can develop it; so can hairstylists, musicians, writers, drivers, athletes, restaurant\nservers, and jack hammer and chain-saw operators. The occurrence of CTS has greatly increased since\nthe 1980s, when personal computers came into use. The tendons swell and compress the median nerve\nthat runs to your hand, causing great pain. A common pattern is rapid and continuous use of the fingers,\nproducing a repetitive wrist motion injury. Women between 29 and 62 experience CTS more often than\nanyone else.\nRaynaud's disease, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and menopause increase the risk of developing\nCTS.\nOther disorders, especially arthritis in the neck, have similar symptoms. But, if the first three fingers in\none or both hands are affected by the pain, then it is probably CTS.",

      "overview": "- As soon as the tingling begins, begin doing some gentle hand exercises. Rotate the wrist\nin a circle for 2 minutes. This exercises all the muscles of the wrist, restores circulation,\nand gets your wrist out of the position that usually causes the trouble.\n- Raise your hands above your head and rotate your arms while rotating your wrists at the\nsame time. Also do some neck turns; look over your right, then left, shoulder. Learn to\nexercise and relax as you work.\n- Vitamin B helps eliminate the problem.\n6\n- Eat half a fresh pineapple daily, for 1-3 weeks. The bromelain in it will reduce swelling\nand pain.\n- Eat only moderate amounts of oxalic acid foods (beets, beet greens, sorrel, Swiss chard,\ncabbage family, eggs, parsley, asparagus.). Avoid spinach, and especially rhubarb. Fish\nhave oxalic acid also.\n- Avoid salt and all sodium foods, for they promote water retention.\n- Try to reduce the impact of repetitive mechanical tasks on your wrists and hands. If\npossible, stop all such movements for several days and see if improvement occurs. If so,\ntry to do these functions less frequently. If possible, rotate your duties, so you do not do\nthose repetitive tasks every day.\n- Keep your weight down. Extra weight puts more pressure on the carpal tunnel.\n- Keep your arms close to your body and your wrists straight while sleeping. For example,\nif you let your hand drop over the side of the bed while you are sleeping, the pressure on\nthe median nerve is increased.\n- You might wish to temporarily wear a wrist splint at night. This helps keep the wrist\nstraight.\n- Do not wrap your wrist in an Ace bandage. This could cut off the circulation.\n- If you have to carry something, make the sure the handle is the right size. If it is too\nsmall or large, it could hurt your wrist.\n- Aloe vera, yarrow, and yucca help restore flexibility and reduce inflammation. Skullcap\nrelieves muscle spasms and pain. Wintergreen oil reduces pain and aids circulation to the\nmuscles.\nPREVENTION—Carpal tunnel syndrome is a problem which many can develop in our time. Here are\nseveral suggestions for avoiding its occurrence:\n- Use a tool instead of flexing your wrists forcibly.\n- Use your whole hand and all your fingers when you grip an object.\n- In doing a task, use your whole arm, not just your wrist. For example, when hammering,\nswing your arm rather than just your wrist.\n- Maintain good posture and keep your elbows bent when typing, writing, etc. What is the\nideal position? Cock your wrist back slightly, so that your thumb is parallel to your\nforearm. Your hand should be in approximately the same position as if it were holding a\npen. This position keeps the carpal tunnel as open as possible. Place a wrist pad on the\ntable, just in front of the keyboard.\n- Before starting handwork, exercise the fingers and wrists for a couple minutes, to warm\nthem up. Take a break from handwork every hour. Shake out your hands every so often\nthroughout the day.\n—Also see \"Tennis Elbow.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The wrath of God will not fall upon one soul that seeks refuge in Him. God\ncares for His children who trust in Him. They may have trials in this life, but their life is secure and they\nwill live with their Maker in heaven.\nSection 9\nNervous-Mental\nPart 3\nConvulsions\nCONVULSIONS (Spasms, Seizures, Fits)\nSYMPTOMS—Paroxysms of involuntary muscular contractions and relaxations, which occur most\nfrequently in children.\nCAUSES—Convulsions are uncontrolled body movements set off by an electrical malfunction of the\nbrain.\nConvulsions can be caused by epilepsy, meningitis, tetanus, uremia, hysteria, or eclampsia. They can\nalso be induced by poisoning from camphor, cyanide, strychnine, santonin, brucine, or aspidium.\nIn children the cause is often wrong diet, rickets, syphilis, malaria, toxemias, or acute infectious\ndiseases.\nIn adults, the cause is often epilepsy, heat cramps, strychnine, or food poisoning.\nConvulsions, due to tetanus and hydrophobia, are easily distinguished and, for the most part, involve a\nsmall portion of the voluntary muscles. Strychnine poisoning causes spasms which involve the whole\nbody.\nHigh fevers of 104o-105o F. are often a cause of convulsions in children.",

Other important\ncauses are constipation and wrong diet. He puts them on a cleansing and building\nprogram, discarding all meat eating, and requiring that they never return to it (so they will\nnot again become infested with worms).\n- If parasites are the cause, use garlic enemas, plus eat garlic (see \"Worms\" for more\ninformation).\n- There is a definite possibility, especially in children, that a food allergy is involved, very\npossibly accompanied by malnutrition (maybe partially caused by being fed too much\njunk food and soft drinks).

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—There are several types of, what are called, seizures:\nAbsence (petit mal): A blank stare lasting about half a minute, and the person is unaware of his\nsurroundings. Most often in children.\nComplex partial (temporal lobe): A blank stare, random activity, and a chewing motion. No memory of\nthis seizure afterward. An aura, or warning indication, may occur before. It may be a certain odor,\nsound, thought, etc. No after memory of the seizure.\nMyoclonuc: Brief but massive muscle jerks.\nSimple partial (Jacksonian): Jerking begins in the fingers and toes, and progresses throughout the body.\nThe person remains conscious.\nSimple partial (sensory): Things that do not exist are seen, heard, or sensed. A general seizure may\nfollow.\nCAUSES—Epilepsy is defined as an episodic disturbance of consciousness, during which generalized\nconvulsions may occur. There are recurring seizures, generally one of seven patterns (listed above). This\nis caused by electrical disturbances, in the nerve cells, in a portion of the brain.\nElectroencephalographic studies reveal a direct relationship between changes in electrical brain\npotentials and the occurrence of seizures.\nEpilepsy is the most common form of seizures, also called convulsions or fits. Epilepsy can be caused by\ninjury to the head, neck, or spinal cord, especially before or during birth. High fevers during early\nchildhood or infectious diseases can also cause it. Heredity can be involved. Oxygen deprivation at birth\nor a later head injury may be causal factors.\nA variety of factors may trigger the onset of a seizure. Oddly enough, an important one is constipation in\nthe transverse colon. Eating bread, especially soft bread, is known to lead to seizures.\nAn improperly functioning ileocecal valve is a possible cause. This permits powerful toxins to enter the\nblood stream and affect the delicate nervous system and brain.\nDuring a seizure, the person may fall during the attack, often injuring himself; he may bite his tongue,\npass urine, and awake to realize something has happened because of muscular soreness.\nThere is a tendency to sleep following the attack. Sometimes attacks occur only during sleep.\nSome seizures take the form of antisocial or unnatural conduct.\nOn recovery, amnesia is generally complete, so no effort is made to hide what happened. The epileptic\nmay gradually deteriorate.\nIMMEDIATE TREATMENT—During the attack, arrange the head to facilitate breathing. Prevent the\ntongue from being bitten or from obstructing the windpipe. Place a pad between the teeth during the\nattack. Afterward allow him to sleep.\nComments from a reader: I am writing in regards to your section on Epilepsy, under which you have\nstated: \"During the attack, arrange the head to facilitate breathing. Prevent the tongue from being bitten\nor from obstructing the windpipe. Place a pad between the teeth during the attack. Afterward allow him\nto sleep.\"\nAlthough a common belief is that a person can swallow his/her tongue during a seizure, or that the\ntongue can obstruct the windpipe, this is not true. During a seizure, the afflicted person's body will\nstiffen and convulse - resulting in biting of the tongue. It is therefore not advised that anything be placed\nin the person's mouth, as that may cause further damage, but instead to place the person on his/her side.\nAdditionally, if by \"arrange the head\" you were referring to turning the person onto his/her side, I would\nask that you please clarify as it is currently vague and unclear. First Aid instructions from the Epilepsy\nFoundation are listed below. I do hope you can update this information so viewers will not be\nmisinformed. -Keep calm and reassure other people who may be nearby. -Don't hold the person down or\ntry to stop his movements. -Time the seizure with your watch. -Clear the area around the person of\nanything hard or sharp. -Loosen ties or anything around the neck that may make breathing difficult. -Put\nsomething flat and soft, like a folded jacket, under the head. -Turn him or her gently onto one side. This\nwill help keep the airway clear. Do not try to force the mouth open with any hard implement or with\nfingers. It is not true that a person having a seizure can swallow his tongue. Efforts to hold the tongue\ndown can injure teeth or jaw. -Don't attempt artificial respiration except in the unlikely event that a\nperson does not start breathing again after the seizure has stopped. -Stay with the person until the seizure\nends naturally. -Be friendly and reassuring as consciousness returns. -Offer to call a taxi, friend or\nrelative to help the person get home if he seems confused or unable to get home by himself. Thank you\nfor your time and cooperation. Sincerely, Debbie Fiore\nSee \"Convulsions\" for more information on dealing with them.\nPREVENTING SEIZURES—Do not eat soft bread; better yet, do not eat any bread. You may find that\nyou should not eat mush either.\nKeep the colon clean. Take enemas or colonics weekly if necessary. Pressure from a clogged colon can\npress against the ileocecal valve and release toxins which are absorbed by the bloodstream.\nIf the bowels do not move each day, take a lemon enema (juice of 2 lemons in 2 quarts water) before\ngoing to bed that night.\nDrink fresh fruit and vegetable juices.\nInclude raw vegetables in your diet.\nCheck your diet with pulse and other tests, to see which foods are a problem. Use rotation diets to this\nobjective. (See \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\")\nAvoid white sugar and white-flour products. Avoid fried foods, animal protein, and artificial sweeteners.\nMaintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Do not overeat! Do not take in excess amounts of food or fluid\nat one time.\nTake manganese supplementation. A lack of it can produce epilepsy. Women who lack it can give birth\nto epileptic children.\nVitamin B deficiency has been linked as a factor in some cases of epilepsy. When given to some\n6\nbabies, in their formula, the epilepsy ceased.\nDeficiencies of vitamins A, D, folic acid, zinc, and aurine (an amino acid) are also involved.\nMagnesium deficiency may cause muscle tremors and convulsive seizures. Epileptics have a lower than\nnormal amount of this mineral. Infants with excess calcium intake had a magnesium loss. Yet other\nstudies revealed that calcium was also important.\nAvoid alcohol, caffeine, pesticides, and aluminum cookware. High levels of aluminum have been found\nin the brains of those with epilepsy. Aluminum is a conductor of electricity, and trace amounts in the\nbrain may trigger seizures.\nToxic metals (lead, copper, mercury, and aluminum) are known to cause seizure. Hypoglycemia is\nlinked to convulsions. Serum glucose levels fall just before a seizure.\nThe artificial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) has been linked to seizures. Beware of lead poisoning\nalso.\nAllergies cause seizures in some. This includes chemicals, pesticides, food additives, or common foods\nsuch as peanuts.\nDoses of folic acid, in excess of 400 mcg per day, can trigger seizures.\nHave a hair analysis done, to see if a metal toxicity could be involved as a causal factor.\nIn some instances, a ketogentic diet is prescribed; but, if used, it should be under the guidance of\nsomeone who understands how to apply it: This diet is keyed to restricting protein and carbohydrate\nintake, increasing fat intake, and producing acid levels in the bloodstream which act to inhibit brain\nstimulation of seizures.\nAvoid the herb, sage. This herb should not be used by anyone with a tendency to seizures.\n—Also see \"Epilepsy—2,\" \"Convulsions,\" and \"Antispasmodic Tincture.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Unless we depend on a power outside of ourselves, Satan will succeed in\naccomplishing our ruin. In looking to Jesus and obeying His Word you will be safe.\nEPILEPSY—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC FACTORS—Abstemious, dry, aseptic dietary, chiefly fruits and grains; vigorous out-of-door\nexercise to the extent of fatigue daily. Prolonged Neutral Bath daily; sweating process 2-3 times a week;\ngraduated cold procedures (Tonic Frictions), avoiding prolonged and intense applications. [Avoid\nconstipation in the transverse colon: this is a key factor in avoiding attacks. Avoid doughy foods that\ntend to constipation.]\nWHEN ATTACK IS THREATENED—Colonic twice daily; copious water drinking; Neutral Pack;\nice to head; rest in bed. Seizure may sometimes be averted by placing the part in cold water.\nAFTER ATTACK—Rest; cold to head; Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub; Half Bath; Revulsive\nDouche to legs; and percussion Douche to spine.\nGENERAL METHOD—Train him to a vigorous regimen; a simple abstemious dietary, abundance of\noutdoor exercise; the daily employment of the Prolonged Neutral Bath, followed by short, moderate cold\napplications; copious water drinking; regulation of all the vital functions, avoiding all sources of nervous\nirritation and exhaustion.\n—Also see \"Epilepsy—1.\"",

(Only grain\nalcohol should be used for internal use; wood alcohol, such as rubbing alcohol, will cause blindness.)\nThe resultant mixture does not spoil.\nThen when a spasm occurs, only a very small amount is given to the person, and he generally pulls out\nof the crisis quickly.\nAntispasmodic tincture is used for all spasms or attacks such as those of the heart, asthma, cough,\nepilepsy, or shock.\nHOW TO PREPARE IT—This formula has been used, for decades by veteran naturopaths, with great\nsuccess. Here is the formula:\nOne-half ounce cayenne pepper and 1 ounce of each of the following herbs: skullcap, skunk cabbage\nroot or seed, gum myrrh, lobelia seed (or the plant if the seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root.\nMix each of the above together while dry and put into a large-mouth jar. Add 1 pint pure grain alcohol\nof 70-100 proof. Eighty proof Vodka works fine because it is tasteless.\n(An alternative to alcohol is to, instead, use 1 pint of apple cider vinegar. Store in the same manner.)\nLet this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shake well, daily.\nAt the end of that time, strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all you can. Store it in a tightly\ncapped bottle. Also put some into a small dropper bottle.\nIn a crisis, it is given in 8-10 drop doses. It can be squirted into the mouth or taken in a tbsp. of water. (If\nstored in vinegar, give in teaspoonful doses, not drops. Its effects are not quite as rapid.)\nAs a cough syrup for children, prepare it in this way: Pour 1 quart water over the herbs. Let it stand for 1\nhour, then strain. Add 1 pint honey. Place it over low heat and let it evaporate to the equivalent of 3\ncupfuls. Pour this hot syrup into hot baby-food jars and seal for future use. Give it in teaspoonful doses\nfor cough, asthma, convulsions, or insomnia.\nJethro Kloss mentions a man who was released from clenched lockjaw by a small application of\nantispasmodic tincture.\nWhen the case is severe, especially with an infant, the tincture can be rubbed onto the chest, neck, and\nbetween the shoulders. Place 2-3 drops in the mouth, and wash down with teaspoon doses of warm water\nwhile the person is kept in bed. If necessary, repeat every 1-2 hours.\nThere are six herbs in the formula. The lobelia is the active agent in relaxing the muscles and\nnormalizing breathing. The cayenne pepper warms, stimulates, and reduces inflammation. The skullcap\nand valerian soothe the nerves and keep small vessels from rupturing. The skunk cabbage and gum\nmyrrh aids in reducing infection.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Our Lord is pleading for us in the presence of the Father at the throne of grace\nin heaven. He is our only hope. Our faith looks up to Him, grasps Him as the One able to save to the\nuttermost, and we are accepted by the Father.\nSection 9\nNervous-Mental\nPart 4\nParalysis\nLOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE—1 (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)\nSYMPTOMS—Progressive muscular weakness and atrophy, weakened respiratory muscles (which can\nresult in pneumonia), difficulty chewing and swallowing, stiffness, cramping, and involuntary quivering\nof small muscles.\nCAUSES—Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease, resulting in\nmuscular atrophy.\nCauses include heredity (10% of the cases) or strenuous physical work in one's occupation, combined\nwith nutritional deficiencies (especially vitamins B complex, E, F, and C). Other factors include viral\ninfections, physical exhaustion, and trauma.\nHeavy metals, ingested or inhaled, can induce damage to the nervous system.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Symptoms vary considerably, but usually include a sore throat, fever, headache, stiff\nneck, and vomiting. Children and adults can become critically ill in 6-24 hours after the first appearance\nof the symptoms. This condition requires rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Take him to the\nemergency room immediately! Demand immediate help!\nSymptoms include sore throat, red or purple skin rash, fever, chills, malaise, headaches, vomiting,\nsensitivity to light, nausea, delirium, stiff neck, and convulsions.\nIn infants: vomiting, fever, difficult feeding, irritability, a high-pitched cry, a bulging fontanel (soft spot\non top of the head). Changes in temperament and extreme sleepiness indicate dangerous changes in\ncerebrospinal fluid.\nWarning: A child can be hurt when he is picked up.\nCAUSES—Meningitis is an inflammation of the two membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.\nThey are called the meninges. In addition, the thin membranes that cover the spinal cord may also be\ninfected. It is a contagious disease.\nCauses include several different viruses (including those causing polio, measles, rubella, fungi, yeast\ninfection) and several types of bacteria.\nInfection can spread from the nose and throat to the meninges. A depleted immune system (along with\nnose and throat trouble) can cause it to enter the blood stream and go to the brain.\nIf not treated properly, a case of flu or ear, nose, and throat infections can develop into meningitis.\nEating heavy meals or taking drugs while sick can cause an infection to drive deeper into the system and\nenter the brain area.\nOther factors aiding in the development of meningitis are alcoholism, brain surgery, brain cancer,\nexposure to chemical agents, head injury, pneumonia, Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, or anything\nthat weakens the immune system (chemotherapy, radiation treatment, steroid therapy, HIV infection,\nand certain types of cancer).\nOf the three main types of meningitis, viral infection is more common and produces milder symptoms,\nsuch as malaise and headache, which generally clears up on its own in a week or two.\nBut the bacterial type requires prompt, aggressive treatment—or brain damage or death can result. (Any\ntime a bacterial infection occurs [such as strep throat or an ear infection], eliminate it; do not ignore the\nproblem.)\nFungal meningitis progresses more slowly, but also requires medical care.\nDo not guess!

Drink plenty of clean liquids. Take cool sponge baths, if\nthere is fever.\n- If untreated, permanent brain damage and possible paralysis can result.\n- Drink citrus juices, from lemons, oranges, and limes.\n- For fever, use catnip tea enemas. The tea can also be sipped.\n- Goldenseal is a natural antibiotic. Echinacea boosts the immune system.\n- It is best not to eat food during the acute phase. Eating food stops the elimination of\ntoxins from the tissues, so that digestion can begin. This causes the toxins to be thrown\nstill deeper into the system.\n- When the acute phase is ended and recovery is beginning, eat a nourishing diet of fruits\nand vegetables. Fresh pineapple helps reduce the infection.\n- Avoid meat, dairy products, caffeine, and salt. Avoid processed, sugared, and whiteflour foods.\n- If there are no complications, recovery usually takes three weeks under a physician's\ncare.\n- Remember: Meningitis is contagious.

Difficulty in\nbreathing, swallowing, and speaking.\nThe onset is gradual, and the symptoms are worse in the evening. The person complains of difficulty in\nchewing, swallowing, and talking.\nCAUSES—Myasthenia gravis is a disease characterized by great muscular weakness (without atrophy)\nand progressive fatigability. The name means \"muscle weakness.\"\nAdolescents and young adults, especially women, are the most likely to have this problem. But it\nsometimes occurs in newborn infants and adults over 40. In the latter case, a tumor in the thymus is\ninvolved. It rarely occurs past 50.\nThe muscles of the face and neck are primarily involved, but those in the trunk and extremities may also\nbe involved.\nSome cases are mild; others are rapidly fatal. When the respiratory system is involved, death is much\nmore likely to result from this disease. Progress of the disorder is variable, and prolonged remission may\noccur.\nIt is thought to be an autoimmune disease that causes malfunctioning of the enzyme, acetylcholine,\nwhich is responsible for inducing muscles to contract. (It is conjectured that there may also be an excess\nof cholinesterase at the myoneural junction in which the nerve impulses fail to induce normal muscle\ncontractions, but this is less likely.)\nThere is a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. Either the\nacetylcholine release is not adequate or the muscle response to the acetylcholine is not sufficient. An\nautoimmune factor may be involved (i.e., there are so many toxins in the body, that the system interferes\nwith normal functions.)\nAutointoxication may thus be a primary cause. Toxins accumulate in the bloodstream from chemicals,\nchronic constipation, etc. Either they destroy the muscular system or they trigger other body systems to\ndo so.\nChronic constipation can cause the cecum to press against the ileocecal valve, releasing poisons of the\ncolon back into the small intestine. This is a dangerous situation, since toxins in the small intestine are\nabsorbed into the blood far more quickly than when they are in the colon.",

These foods include tomatoes, white potatoes, green and\nred peppers, egg plants, and tobacco.\n- Avoid the glue foods, such as white flour and dairy products. Stay away from fried\nfoods, meat, all animal fats, cheese, and eggs.\n- Do not overwork. Learn to relax; learn to work at a more moderate pace, and stop more\nfrequently to rest.\n- Walk a little outdoors, and gradually build up. But do not overdo. A little walking is\ngood; too much of any exercise might not be.\n- Helpful herbs include slippery elm, comfrey, oatstraw, and the nervine herbs: skullcap,\nhop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, and small amounts of lobelia.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The world that Satan has claimed and has ruled over with cruel tyranny, the\nson of God has, by one vast achievement, encircled in His love and connected again with the throne of\nGod. Thank your heavenly Father for what He offers you! And accept it now, right now.\nPARKINSON'S DISEASE (Shaking Palsy, Paralysis agitans,\nParkinsonianism)\nSYMPTOMS—Initially: mild to moderate tremor of the hand or hands while at rest, a feeling of being\nslow and heavy, tendency to tire more easily, muscular stiffness, loss of skill in the fingers and thumb\n(writing, buttoning and unbuttoning, playing the piano, etc.)\nLater: depression, loss of appetite, muscular rigidity, permanent rigid stoop, shuffling gait, drooling,\ntremors, fixed facial expression, and impaired speech. Ability to maintain balance may be affected.\nThe body gradually becomes rigid as limbs stiffen. Dementia may occur.\nPrinciple signs are tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, and slow or retarded movement. Tremors and\nslowness generally begin in one limb, then progress to the other limb on the same side; later still to the\nother side. Usually the hands are affected before the feet.\nCAUSES—Parkinson's disease is a gradual degeneration of the nervous system. The nerve cells in the\nbasal ganglion of the brain are gradually destroyed.\nParkinson's disease is one of the most common debilitating diseases in the United States. But actual\ndisability usually does not occur for 10-15 years after onset of symptoms.\nAlthough the underlying cause is not known, symptoms appear when there is a lack of dopamine in the\nbrain. Dopamine is made by the body, and carries messages from one nerve cell to another. Normally,\nanother neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is made, to keep dopamine in balance. When there is not enough\nacetylcholine, myasthenia gravis occurs; when there is not enough dopamine, the result is Parkinson's\ndisease.\nIn Parkinson's, the problem generally is destruction of the cells which make dopamine. But sometimes\nthe cause is blockage of the dopamine receptors in the brain.\nOne possible cause of this disorder is that too many toxins have been released in the body for the blood\nto filter out through the liver. An excess of chemicals, drugs, toxins in meat eating, etc., are thought to\nbe involved. It is known that one of the chemicals in heroine directly destroys the key brain cells\npreventing Parkinson's. A chronic poor diet, over many years, is also considered to be a significant\nfactor.",

      "overview": "- It is very important that the person afflicted with Parkinson's disease keep active.\nMuscles which are not used atrophy more quickly. The person's own determination and\nfaithfulness in an exercise program will forestall the progress of the disease better than\nalmost anything else. Every exercise keeps the muscles more useful. Use a wide variety of\nsimple exercises! Buy a book on weight lifting; but, of course, use much smaller weights.\nSwing the arms forcefully when walking. Exercises involving joint movements (including\nthe neck) are very important.\n- Keep the feet a distance apart, when walking, and take short steps, when turning.\n- Typing, writing, working with clay, etc., helps the fingers.\n- Breathe deeply in and out.\n- Take frequent rest periods.\n- Read aloud, to keep the mouth muscles in good condition.\n- Any act difficult to perform should be done daily.\n- A nutritious diet, adequate rest, exercise in the open air, enough fluids, and sunlight help\nslow the effects of Parkinson's disease.\n- Octocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.\n- Eat foods and take supplements containing antioxidants. The most important of these is\nvitamin E (3,200 IU daily!) and vitamin C (3,000 mg daily!). This can slow the\nprogression of Parkinson's disease by 2-3 years! Theoretically, a person who takes\nsignificant dosage levels will never contract Parkinson's disease in the first place. It\nappears that free-radical damage may be a major cause of damage of dopamine-producing\nbrain cells.\n- Iron supplementation seems to help in some cases. The production of tyrosine, an\nenzyme involved in dopa production (the precursor of dopamine), is stimulated by iron\nsupplementation in the diet.\n- Here are some additional helps and dosages of worthwhile natural substances:\noctocosanol (300 mcg, three times a day), Neuro-Gen leucine (10 gm/day), l-methionine\n(5 gm/day), essential fatty acids (1tbsp., twice a day), ltyrosine (100 mg/day), dlphenoalanine (100 mg, three times a day), B (200 mg, three times a day), B (100 mg,\n1 6\nthree times a day), betaine HCl (75-200 mg three times a day before meals).\n- Overweight is a problem; take the extra weight off.\n- Ingestion of aluminum is a factor in Alzheimer's disease, and it may also be involved in\nParkinson's disease. Do not use aluminum cookware or use deodorants containing it (alum\nis aluminum). Also avoid lead. Some people with Parkinson's disease have high levels of\nlead in their brains.\n- L-dopa (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine), in form of the drug brand, Levodopa, is a synthetic\ndopamine which is given to patients, to supply the missing dopamine. Intriguingly\nenough, actual dopamine (from animal sources) cannot be given, because there is a bloodbrain barrier rejecting it. So levodopa is given, which is accepted (through conversion to\ndopamine in the basal ganglion).\n- But two facts should be noted: (1) Vitamin B reverses the effects of levodopa, so efforts\n6\nmust be made to eliminate B from the diet. (Eat in moderation bananas, oatmeal, peanuts,\n6\nwhole grains, potatoes, meat, and fish and only eat protein foods in the evening.) (2)\nLevodopa usually produces side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, insomnia, mental\nconfusion, and agitation, as well as liver and kidney damage.\n- L-dopa and carbidopa can aggravate and speed up the progress of Parkinson's disease in\nmany cases, and is said to have little beneficial effect in over half the cases.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Man's happiness must always be guarded by the law of God. That law is the\nhedge which God has placed about His vineyard. By it those who obey are protected from evil. But only\nthrough Christ's enabling merits can you be empowered to obey the Ten Commandments.\nPOLIO (Poliomyelitis, Infantile Paralysis)\nSYMPTOMS—Fever, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and irritability.\nIncubation is generally 2-7 days, and onset is often abrupt. There may be digestive disturbance, plus a\nslight elevation of temperature, usually for not more than 3 days. Then paralysis may, or may not,\ndevelop.\nBend the person's neck forward. If it aches, polio may be coming on.\nCAUSES—Poliomyelitis means \"gray marrow,\" and is inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal\ncord. The condition is not confined to infancy, nor is paralysis always involved. Polio is a virus infection\nof the spinal cord which destroys the nerves controlling muscular movement, often resulting in paralysis\nof certain muscles.\nThe first of two stages of polio is the infectious stage, when the virus is active. The second is the\nnoninfectious stage, when recovery may occur.\nParalysis may be confined to a small part of the body or much, or nearly all, of it. But muscle atrophy\nmay also occur. Death usually only occurs in bulbar and respiratory cases. Aside from\nbronchopneumonia, other complications are relatively few.\nEpidemics, when they occur, usually reach their peak during the warmest months (July and August).",

      "overview": "- In the late 1940s, Benjamin Sandler, M.D., was interviewed on the radio in the spring,\njust before the summer polio season. He declared that, if sugar foods and especially Cokes\nand soft drinks were avoided, polio would not be contracted. This went into the\nnewspapers and the East Coast area covered by the announcement had very little polio\nthat summer. Later, Sandler wrote a book detailing his concept.\nSugar injures the nerves; calcium is needed by the nerves; highly acid substances remove\ncalcium; phosphorous locks with calcium and carries it off, making it unavailable. Coca\nCola-type drinks combine all these special qualities! The liquid in Coke is more acid than\nvinegar, yet is not noticed because of the very high sugar content. Coke is phosphoric\nacid. So the sugar and acid eat away the calcium, and the phosphorus immediately locks\ninto it. A tooth, dropped in a glass of Coke, will melt away in a matter of hours.\n- Another factor is being cold. People drink Cokes and other soft drinks at swimming\npools, then jump and in and vigorously swim in the cold water. So many people contract\npolio at swimming pools in the summer that it is suspected that there must be something\nin the pool water. But the problem is the soft drinks, not contaminated pool water.\n- The body is adapted to the intense heat of mid-summer; but poor diet plus soft drinks\nweaken it, then the cold plunge intensifies the effects.\n- Because it was so dangerous to the health, Coca Cola was banned from interstate\ncommerce by the original Food and Drug Administration early in the 20th century. That is\nwhy, to this day, Cokes and Pepsi's are made in local bottling plants. The syrup is shipped\ninterstate, and then, with water, is poured into bottles.\n- Franklin D. Roosevelt was very athletic. He fought a forest fire near his home, ate some\njunk food, and jumped in an ice-cold river to cool off. He then came down with polio.\n- Another factor is keeping the body warm.\n- As soon as a person comes down with polio, he is placed in bed and observed. —But,\nwhat should be done is to place him immediately in a warm, full bathtub or, better, give\nhim the \"Kenny packs.\"\n- Nurse Kenny (called Sister Kenny, because nurses in Australia are called \"sister\")\napplied hot packs to the patients (on parts, or all, of their bodies), and eliminated polio\nwith few or no after effects. But this water therapy method was not permitted in America.\nIt was too effective.\nOther factors:\n- During the infectious stage, keep the diet high in protein and potassium, to replace that\nwhich is lost because of tissue destruction.\n- Fluid, caloric, and sodium intake should also be increased because of the fever.\nAdditional B vitamins are also needed, along with vitamins A and C.\n- Give antispasmodic tincture (which see). Give doses (according to age) of 8-15 drops in\n1/4th glass of hot water.\n- Helpful herbs include prickly ash berries, wild cherry bark, valerian root, skullcap,\ngoldenseal, black cohosh, red clover, catnip, and yellow dock.\n- Dr. Salk, himself (developer of injectable polio vaccine), warned against the serious\ndangers in taking oral polio vaccine! Beware of oral polio vaccine! In the latter part of the\n20th century, oral polio vaccine has produced more cases of polio than any other agency.\n- In addition, there is extreme danger in handling the bowel movement of an infant who\nhas received the oral polio vaccine! You can get crippling polio from doing so.\n- Medical history reveals that people who were vegetarians, did not eat junk foods, or\ndrink soft drinks, but lived a clean life—and avoided polio vaccines; and those recently\nreceiving them—have rarely contracted polio.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The way of salvation has been opened to the fallen race on Planet Earth. That\nsalvation is offered to you, right now. It is yours to claim, as you accept Christ and let Him strengthen\nyou, to obey the precepts in the Bible.",

      "overview": "IMPROVING YOUR MEMORY—Here are several suggestions to try to remember:\nThe attitude toward remembering is important. As we get older, it is easier to become lazy about trying\nto learn.\nPay attention to what you want to remember. Sometimes we are too busy or indolent to really give our\nattention to what we need to remember.\nAn outstanding way to remember something is to say it out aloud to yourself. When you do this, you\nboth speak it and hear it. If it is written down and you do this—you see it, speak it, and hear it.\nAn equally outstanding way to memorize something (or teach it to children) is to say it over several\ntimes. Saying it, speaking it, hearing it, and repetition, are powerful ways to learn math tables and other\nthings.\nHere are more suggestions:\nCategorize the items you want to remember. List what you need to remember under their logical\ncategories, and you will be more likely to remember the main points and the subsidiary ones.\nWhen you set your glasses down on a table where you do not usually place them, take a good look at\nthem and think about what you have done.\nAs you walk away from your car in a mall parking lot, say out loud, to yourself, aspects of the location,\nso you can return to it.\nWhen trying to remember someone's name, take a good look at their face as you think of, or speak, their\nname.\nWhen trying to remember numbers, put them into units or chunks. It is harder to remember 6-8-7-2-5-09 than it is to recall 687-2509.\nIf you are trying to memorize a new word or how to spell it, learn the meaning of the word and make it\npart of your everyday vocabulary. Or write it down several times.\nAssociate a new word or name with a similar word or an object.\nSelect the most important things to remember, and skip the rest.\nQuiz yourself on what you are supposed to remember before you come to the time when you have to use\nthat knowledge.\nAvoid stress. When you are under tension or in a time schedule, it is harder to remember things.\nOf course, you can also jot down lists on paper. Some people quickly write notes on the palm of their\nhand.\nAnd, of course, make sure you are eating a good diet, skipping the junk food, getting fresh air, exercise\nevery day, and getting enough rest at night.\nIn addition, there are also nutrition and lifestyle factors which will affect your memory. See \"Nerves,\nStrengthening.\"\n—Also see \"Memory Problems.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—How much should those rejoice who are the objects of such amazing love!\nChrist loved you, or He would not have died to forgive your sins and enable you to obey His Father's\nlaw. Accept the great salvation, and rejoice that your name is written in heaven.\nMEMORY PROBLEMS (Forgetfulness)\nSYMPTOMS—You find you are forgetting too many things.\nCAUSES—People fear memory problems, because it might indicate the onset of Alzheimer's disease\n(which see). Alzheimer's generally begins gradually in the mid-40s, and is fairly common among many\nolder people; so folk have reason to be concerned.\nBut two facts stand out: Some memory loss does not have to mean Alzheimer's; it is possible to keep the\nmind in good shape, even into advanced age.\nAlcoholism, aging, candidiasis, stress, allergies, thyroid problems, hypoglycemia, diabetes, and poor\ncirculation are factors in memory loss.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Disoriented perceptions of space and time, inability to concentrate or communicate, and\nmemory loss.\nThis produces depression, agitation, withdrawal, insomnia, irritability, memory loss, personality\nchanges, severe mood swings, and senility.\nAn intriguing early warning sign has been discovered at the San Diego Medical Center: As much as 2\nyears before mental decline, those with Alzheimer's begin to lose their sense of smell. The rate at which\nthe ability to distinguish strong odors diminishes is an indicator of how rapidly an individual will lose\nmental functioning. (But smokers have already lost part of this sense, so the diagnostic test does not\nwork as well when applied to them.)\nCAUSES—Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration. Memory and thought processes\nare weakened and disoriented.\nNerve fibers, leading into, and out of, the hippocampus in the brain become tangled and short circuited.\nAs a result, information is no longer carried to, and from, the brain. New memories cannot be gained,\nand old memories cannot be retrieved.\nIn addition, plaques of a certain protein (beta-amyloid) build up in the brain, damaging nerve cells.\nOne form of Alzheimer's occurs between 36 and 45, and is quite rapid. The more gradual form develops\nin those who are 65 or 70.\nSimple forgetfulness is not Alzheimer's. If you do not remember your wife's name, that is forgetfulness;\nif you forget you have a wife, that is dementia (of which Alzheimer's is a form).\nThere are other disorders which produce similar symptoms: Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries),\nwhich slowly reduces blood flow to the brain; a series of minor strokes; hypothyroidism; advanced\nsyphilis.\nMany elderly people are taking 8 or 10 medicinal drugs. This drugging will surely affect the brain. You\ncan see the effects in nursing homes across the continent. Add to this a devitalized diet of fried,\nprocessed, and junk food.\nOther causes include heavy metals in the body. One in particular stands out: When you hear the words,\n\"Alzheimer's disease,\" think of it as \"aluminum disease,\" for this is what it often is.\nAutopsies on persons who died with Alzheimer's reveal accumulations of up to 4 times the normal\namount of aluminum in the nerve cells of the brain. Significantly, especially high concentrations are in,\nand around, the hippocampus.\n(See \"Aluminum Poisoning\" for much more information.)\nBut those with Alzheimer's also have high levels of mercury in their brain. Beware of amalgam dental\nfillings. Mercury from the fillings gradually passes into the body and, over a period of time, accumulates\nin the brain.\nObtaining an adequate supply of minerals in the diet helps keep heavy metals from accumulating in the\nbody.\nWomen with Alzheimer's have lower estrogen levels than normal.\nFree radicals are another factor. Avoid foods which contain them.\nThose with Alzheimer's have low levels of vitamin B and zinc in their bodies. All the B complex\n12\nvitamins are important.\nVitamins A and E, important antioxidant vitamins, are also important.\nLevels of choline and ethanolamine are lower in those with Alzheimer's.\nUndergo a trial of intensive nutritional therapy, especially B injections. This may ward off the\n12\ndeveloping problem.\nThose with Alzheimer's tend to have a strong craving for sweets. But such a craving is frequently an\nindication of a food hunger for vitamins and minerals.\nSome people with Down's syndrome (which see) live to be in their 30s or 40s; they usually develop\nAlzheimer's.",

Most older people do\nnot have this problem. Many people in advanced age are quite clear in their thought processes.\n(But there are actually two types of dementia: Primary dementia comes on gradually, without apparent\ncause. Secondary dementia comes on suddenly from brain injury, operation, drugs, or diabetic coma; is\nusually reversible. Senility and Alzheimer's are examples of primary dementia.)\nCommon causes of senility include poor blood circulation to, and in, the brain, cerebral arteriosclerosis,\nheavy metal toxicity, prolonged nutritional deficiency, prolonged use of medicinal drugs, and lack of\nexercise and fresh air.\nCalcification and fatty cholesterol deposits in the middle cerebral artery reduces the main blood supply\nto the brain, resulting in a poor oxygen supply to the brain. This produces a loss of memory and typical\n\"senile\" changes.\nThe experts tell us that, over a matter of years, wearing uncomfortable collars and neckties tend to cause\neddies in the carotid arteries, contributing to the deposition of cholesterol.\nMany of those diagnosed as senile are actually suffering from the effects of medicinal drugs. Avoid\ndrugs throughout your life, if you want a happy old age. But hearing, thyroid, liver, or kidney problems\ncan also produce apparent memory loss. There is the possibility of brain tumors, as well as stroke, and\nvarious problems with the nervous system.\nA combination of nutritional deficiencies is often the underlying cause.",

The B complex vitamins are important for the nervous system and brain.\n- A New England hospital successfully treated senility by giving niacin and a highpotency vitamin supplement. This opened up the narrowed blood vessels. Niacin has a\nvasodilatory effect on the body. That is why, when taken, it temporarily causes the face to\nflush.\n- Stop using alcohol, tobacco, and nicotine.\n- Eat lightly of nutritious food. Mainly eat raw or slowly cooked foods. Raw seeds and\nnuts help the brain, but eat in moderation. Millet and buckwheat are good.\n- Ginkgo, an herb, may help prevent further deterioration of mental capacities.\n- Daily exercising, to the point of breathlessness, is vital to good circulation.

Hyperactive\nchildren often control the situation in the home more than the parents. Because parents are too yielding,\nchildren find they can scream their way to dominance, and become uncontrollable.\nWhen spoiled children enter school, they sometimes try to use overactivity to control their new\nenvironment.\nHyperactive children often have learning disabilities.\nCertain types of fluorescent lights are overstimulating.\nOverstimulation from television, competitive games, violent TV programs and, nutritional deficiencies\nare major factors.\nMothers who smoke are more likely to give birth to brain-damaged or hyperactive children.\nChildren from broken homes are more likely to have this problem.\nA strong link has been established between learning disabilities and juvenile crime.

Thank God, there is power in the blood, to cleanse from sin and\ndefilement. There is strength in the atonement, to enable man to fulfill the will of God in his life.\nPHOBIAS and PANIC ATTACKS (Irrational Fears; Anxiety Disorder;\nAgoraphobia; Claustrophobia, etc.)\nSYMPTOMS—An irrational fear of something, which ordinary people are not bothered by. The experts\ncall it an irrational, involuntary, inappropriate fear reaction that generally leads to an avoidance of\ncommon everyday places, objects, or situations.\nSymptoms include attacks of tension, panic, dizziness, tightening of the throat, inability to swallow,\nmuscle twitching, sweating, depression, nausea, and obsessions. Feeling of being outside the body.\nThe heart starts beating faster; the person feels nauseous, shaky, as if about to faint.\nCAUSES—There are three types of phobias: simple phobias, social phobias, and agoraphobia.\nThose with simple phobias dread a certain situation, place, or object.\nSocial phobics are those who do not like to be in public situations, such as a party. They fear doing\nsomething which may embarrass themselves.\nAgoraphobics fear being alone, being in public places, or being in strange places. It is a fear of being\naway from a safe person or place. This is the phobia that people most frequently talk to professional\ncounselors about. Most agoraphobics are women, who develop it between 15 and 35.\nPanic attacks are closely related to phobias and strongly held anxieties.\nThe body has a natural fight-or-flight mechanism, when more adrenaline is produced, causing the body\nto increase metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, so the body will have more immediate\nenergy. Muscles become tense, and heartbeat and breathing become more rapid.\nBut when this mechanism occurs, without a reasonable reason, the result is a panic attack.\nThe problem often develops suddenly after a major problem, such as a severe illness, accident, or mental\ndepression.\nThe attack may occur suddenly, perhaps while standing in line at the checkout counter. The worst thing\nsuch people can do is to go home and stay there, in order to avoid facing the problematic situation. This\nprevents the formation of coping skills and only worsens the problem.\nSome can only go outdoors if they have a certain friend or trusted dog with them. Some can move freely\nabout in a feared area if it is dark. Wearing sunglasses when they go out in the daytime may ease the\nproblem while they are overcoming it.\nHot weather, fatigue, or illness often makes the symptoms worse.\nPost-menstrual syndrome is another cause.",

Only eat whole grains.\n- Avoid caffeine in every form (including chocolate) if you have panic attacks. Do not\ndrink alcohol. Medicinal drugs can be a cause.\n- Rebound anxiety and panic attacks can occur when Valium, Xanix, or Prozac is taken, to\nward them off. Xanix can be addictive!\n- Food allergies can be the cause (cow's milk, corn, etc.). Keep a food diary and gradually,\nover a period of time, determine what foods are bothering you. Do pulse tests (which see).\n- Panic attacks and calcium deficiencies go hand in hand. Calcium protects the nerves and\nprevents toxins from irritating them.\n- Valuable minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium are depleted by stress.\nThe B vitamins are also important in resisting stress.\n- Selenium elevates mood and decreases anxiety.\n- Take chromium (200-300 mcg/day), B (100 mg/3 times day), B (450 mg/3 times day),\n6 3\nB , B , B (50 mg/3 times day), tryptophane (10 gr/3 times day), calcium (2000 mg/day),\n1 2 5\nand magnesium (800 mg/day).\n- Eat a rounded balance of amino acids; but, of course, do not consume too much protein.\n- Chemical fumes, such as formaldehyde from newly purchased clothes or carpets, can\ninduce panic attack feelings.\n- A severe hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) reaction. Professionals call this a \"crash and\nburn\" curve because the down slope on the glucose curve is almost vertical. Diabetes can\nbe involved here. (See \"Hypoglycemia\" and \"Diabetes.\")\n- Do a six-hour glucose tolerance test.\n- Get regular exercise out-of-doors. Adequate rest is important.\n- When you have a problem, have a friend you can talk it over with.\n- Avoiding your fear keeps you from overcoming it. Face your fear and, slowly, reason\nwith yourself that it is nothing to be worried about. One individual feared allowing a small\nbird on, or near, her. She overcame it by slowly placing her finger near a tame canary in a\ncage, which hopped on and sat quietly. After doing this for several days, the fear was\novercome.\n- Think to yourself, \"That person (object, place) cannot hurt me.\" It is the truth, and keep\ntelling it to yourself. Shift from negative thoughts toward it, to positive thoughts.\n- Recognize the attack for what it is. You have had them before, so you know you are not\ngoing to die. You have left the house before, and you know you can do it again. You can\ndo it.\n- Be easy on yourself, but keep pushing forward. Even if an attack comes on, tell yourself\nhow you succeeded, and keep at it. Do not give up.\n- Start out slowly, but expose yourself to the unpleasant environment a little every week.\nSet goals for yourself: one-week goals, 8-week goals, etc. Push forward and accomplish\nthem.\n- You will notice that sometimes the fear is stronger than at other times. Determine what\ncauses it to increase: a dietary problem, not enough rest, etc.\n- When an attack comes on, you have an excess of adrenaline. So do not sit still. Instead\nmove about and do something; this will help use it up. Walk around or exercise during the\nattack. If the situation is such that you cannot move about (you are standing in line, etc.),\nthen play a game at alternatively tightening and loosening various muscles in your body.\nTighten the large muscles in your upper legs, then release them.\n- It is now known that people with inner ear problems (where the sense of balance is\nlocated) tend to have phobias and panic attacks.\n- When an attack seems to be coming on, breathe deeply. Take repeated deep breaths. This\nrelaxes the mind and helps the whole system brace against the intruding fear. (When an\nattack begins, phobics tend to take short, rapid breaths. The body is not receiving enough\noxygen and is losing too much carbon dioxide, the heart begins beating faster, and there is\na sense of air hunger.) Instead, breathe slowly and deeply.\n- Women who wear tight-fitting clothes tend to become chest breathers, and are more\nlikely to have panic attacks. Men should wear suspenders.\n- Maintain good posture. Practice deep breathing every so often.\n- When an attack begins to occur, or if even the thought of the feared item begins to come\nto mind, tell yourself \"stop!\" If necessary, say \"Stop!\" out loud. Then consciously change\nyour thoughts to something else, something pleasant. Keep doing this. By doing thoughtstopping, you will see excellent progress in as little as 4 weeks.\n- When you are completely relaxed and in a pleasant environment, think casually about\nthe feared item. Candidly tell yourself that it does not amount to anything. Then change\nthe thought to something else.\n- \"Flooding\" occurs when the person goes into the feared situation (such as a shopping\nmall) and stays there until the fears leave. This generally takes 8 to 12 hours.\n- Reinforcement takes place when you write the shopping list until it no longer bothers\nyou. Then you put on your coat and go to the door. Then you go outside to the car. Then,\nwhen this no longer bothers you; you go to the store and walk up to the door. Later, you\ngo on in and buy the groceries.\n- Pray to God for help. He can give you the strength you need to meet your needs.\nThousands have come to Him and obtained the help needed to win great victories in their\nlives. It is a sweet experience to have peace with God.\n- Herbs to help strengthen the body include dong quai, gotu kola, kelp, ginkgo, passion\nflower, slippery elm, suma, valerian, and lady's slipper.\n—Also see \"Hyperventilation\" and \"Nerves, Strengthening.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God is the lifegiver. From the beginning, all His laws were ordained to life.\nBut sin broke in upon the order that God had established, and discord followed. It is only because the\nRedeemer died on our behalf, that we can be enabled to return obedience to the King of the universe.",

In this article, we will assume that heart trouble is not\nthe problem. But you may want to check our various sections under Cardiovascular:\nHeart.\n- People who know they might experience hyperventilation attacks, from time to time,\nsometimes carry a paper sack with them.\n- Exercise also helps. It not only reduces anxiety, but exercise requires more oxygen—so\nfaster breathing is just fine.\n- Do not smoke. This only adds to the problem, for nicotine is a stimulant and can aid in\ntriggering attacks. Caffeine is another stimulant to avoid.\n- Practice calm, relaxed breathing. The average you should strive for is one moderate\nbreath every 6 seconds or 10 every minute. Ordinary people need never concern\nthemselves with how often they breath; but, if you have this special problem, you may\nwant to practice doing it the right way every so often.\n- The more tense you are, the faster you will breath; so be calm, and think about breathing\nslower.\n- Think about someone else beside yourself.

Being kind to others helps you feel better yourself.\n- Beware of eating or shopping binges, to help you feel better. Neither accomplish the\nintended purpose.\n—Also see \"Manic Depression\" and \"Nerves, Strengthening.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—If you would have broad views, noble thoughts and aspirations, choose\nassociations that will strengthen right principles. Let every thought and the purpose of every action bend\nto the securing of the future life, with the eternal happiness it will bring you.\nMANIC DEPRESSION (Bipolar Disorder; Mania)\nSYMPTOMS—Extreme pessimism, withdrawal from society, changes in sleep patterns. A sudden loss\nof interest in, and failure to, complete projects started with enthusiasm. There is chronic irritability,\nsudden attacks of rage when crossed, and loss of inhibition. More symptoms given below.\nCAUSES—Mania is a mental state characterized by excessive excitement. Depression is a mental state\ncharacterized by dejection, lack of hope, and absence of cheerfulness.\nBoth of these qualities are strikingly observed in manic depression. Manic depression is cyclic, or\ncircular affective psychosis, in which there are alternating moods of depression and mania. Ordinarily\nthere is a series of periods of psychotic depression or excessive well-being, appearing in any sequence\nand alternating with longer periods of relative normalcy.\nThough intensity may vary greatly, the manic shows an elevated though unstable mood, a flight of ideas,\nand great physical activity. The case of primary depression finds one thinking that all exertion is\nexhausting. There is difficulty in thinking or acting and the person is very unhappy.\nManic-depressive disorder is also called bipolar disorder. It typically begins as depression and then\ndevelops into alternating periods of depression and mania.\nBoth mania and depression can vary in intensity and length of the cycles (a few days to many months).\nDuring the depression phase, some do nothing while others go through the motions of everyday work\nwhile always feeling depressed.\nHypomania is a burst of energy and activity, but full-blown manic psychosis includes delusions of\ngrandeur, invincibility, or persecution, and may result in day and night activity without sleep.\nFactors inducing manic depression include an overgrowth of yeast in the intestinal tract, food allergies,\nenvironmental sensitivities, and certain diseases: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes,\nAlzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.",

      "overview": "- A good nourishing diet is very important, omitting all junk food.\n- Avoid processed, sugar, and fried foods.\n- Locate allergy foods and eliminate them. (See \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\")\n- Food allergies, environmental sensitivities, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia (both of\nwhich see) are major causes. Take a 6-hour glucose tolerance test. During the test,\nsomeone must stay with the person and record his emotions and events (is he on an up,\ndown, or both).\n- Foods which are common offenders include cow's milk, corn, wheat, rye, soy, and sugar.\n- But also consider house dust, perfume, formaldehyde, and cosmetics as allergenic factors\nto be avoided.\n- Solving the manic depressive problem can require some weeks of careful diet and\nelimination of offending factors.\n- High doses of the B-complex vitamins are important. They normalize and strengthen\nnerve function. The minerals found in nourishing food are also needed.\n- Chromium and vanadium (500 mcg, 4 times a day), essential fatty acids (5 gm, 3 times a\nday), niacin (450 mg, 4 times a day), B , B , B (each at 5 gm, twice a day).\n1 5 6\n- Avoid the amino acids, ornithine and arginine. Some say these and choline may make\nsymptoms worse. Others say that choline is needed. Still others say that choline should\nonly be taken in normal amounts with other B vitamin supplements.

There may be easy laughing and crying; episodes of emotionalism, possibly without\nany apparent explanation, and even occurring in sleep. The problem may, or may not, be psychotic in\nnature.\nIn some cases, fugues occur.

      "overview": "- There may be heredity factors, but the environmental factors and lifestyle are very\nimportant! Nutritional deficiencies have a strong effect on mental health.\n- Autointoxication and constipation are contributing factors in mental illness. Symptoms\nwhich are alleviated range from mental sluggishness to hallucinations. Even schizophrenia\n(which see) can be greatly lessened.\n- There is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is\nclogged, mental illness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in\nothers.\n- Eliminate the \"glue foods\"; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous\nand toxins in it, and lead to mental problems. Such foods include white flour, sugar, eggs,\nmeat, peanuts, and dairy products.\n- Brain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients (see \"Nerves,\nStrengthening\").\n- It is known that many cases of mental illness are solved when a simple, nourishing, diet,\nincluding sufficient fiber and adequate vitamins and minerals, are given and the colon is\ncleaned out with enemas or colonics.\n- A high-carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the\nbrain, and produces a calming, peaceful, feeling.\n- Exercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps\nrejuvenate the body and mind.\n- Allergy specialists successfully treat individuals with mental illness by isolating foods\nand chemicals in the environment which induce the mental problems. Allergic reactions\nmay be a factor in criminal behavior. In some cases, the offending food does not cause\nmental reactions until hours after being eaten. This is called \"masked food allergy.\" Do\nnot under-rate the allergy factor! (See \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\")\n- Many persons with schizophrenia, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning\ndisorders are caused by too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes.\nPlastic water pipes are the safest.\n- Herbs which calm the brain and nerves include hops, chamomile, skullcap, valerian,\nwood betony, and schizandra.\n—Also see \"Schizophrenia\" and \"Nerves, Strengthening.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—There is a God in Israel, who can bring deliverance to all that are oppressed.\nHe will draw near to you, right where you are, and minister to your needs. All you need to do is ask\nHim—just now.\nINSANITIES (Post-Febrile; Post-Operative; Toxic; Puerperal Confusional)\n(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nMALNUTRITION—Rest, careful Tonic Frictions.\nAUTOINTOXICATION—Aseptic dietary; fruit diet for 3-4 days: Warm Baths, Radiant Heat Bath,\nSweating Wet Sheet Pack, followed by short cold applications; Wet Sheet Rub; or brief Cold Douche;\ncopious water drinking; Colonic daily for a week or two.\nPUERPERAL LESIONS OR COMPLICATIONS—Hot vaginal irrigation, Neutral or tonic Sitz\nBath.\nFEVER—Absolute rest in bed; prolonged Tepid Bath at 880-920 F., 30-60 minutes; Cooling Enemas;\nCold Compress to head; copious water drinking.\nALCOHOLISM—Withdraw alcohol at once; withhold food for 3 days; nutritive enemas; copious water\ndrinking; Neutral Colonic daily for a week.\nUREMIA—See under \"Nephritis, Acute.\"\n- For additional information, see under \"Mania.\"\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—The same as those of Mania, when conditions coincide. Especially avoid\nall intensely exciting procedures.\nGENERAL METHOD—In most cases essentially the same as for Mania, giving special attention to the\nparticular causal element which may be a prominent factor in the case. In certain cases, the symptoms\nare those of Melancholia, and the treatment must be modified accordingly.\nSCHIZOPHRENIA (Paranoic, Catatonic, Hebephrenic; Dementia Praecox)\nSYMPTOMS—Principle signs are moodiness, solitary habits, stupor and excitement, delusions and\nhallucinations.\nHallucinations common, especially of hearing. Loss of emotion or, if shown, it is out of place. Actions\nare absent or inappropriate. There may be impulsive destructive acts and negativism. Extremities tend to\nbe cold, blue, and edematous (puffy with fluids). Conscious, but takes little cognizance of what is going\non about him. Delusions frequent but absurd, often of grandeur and persecution. May have attacks of\ntears or laughter. There may be excited activity. May remain in a stupor. Grimaces and mannerisms are\nfrequent. Symptoms sometimes change form.\nSchizophrenia affects about 3% of the population at some time in their lives.\nCAUSES—This is the most important of the psychoses, and is characterized by a loss of contact with\nthe environment and by a disintegration of personality. The earlier name for it was dementia praecox.\nThere are four primary types. A vague sense of being two personalities and \"changed\" occurs in all\ntypes:\n1 - Simple schizophrenia: The person becomes dull emotionally, loses ambition, and tends to withdraw.\nYet there is no serious intellectual impairment.\n2 - Paranoid schizophrenia: The person develops extensive delusions of persecution. He believes people\nare plotting against him.\n3 - Catatonic schizophrenia: The person may show stereotyped excitement or simulate a stupor. But he\nwill clearly remember it, if he later recovers.\n4 - Hebephrenic schizophrenia: There are mannerisms, speech anomalies, hysteroid symptoms,\ndelusions, hallucinations, and often a dreamy, ineffectual reaction.\nSome believe schizophrenia is hereditary; others think that only attitudinal, dietetic, and external factors\nlead to it (head injuries, complications during birth, reaction to a virus or medicinal drug, environmental\npoisons).\nA wide range of medicinal drugs can produce schizoid symptoms. It is known that many schizophrenics\nhad birth complications or a head injury in childhood.\nSchizophrenia is also linked to an excess of copper in the body. High copper levels cause vitamin C and\nzinc levels to drop. It is believed that a zinc deficiency may be a key factor inducing schizophrenia. A\nfull 80% of those with this disorder have a deficiency of zinc and an excess of copper and iron in their\nbody tissues. Supplementation of zinc and manganese are needed to correct this.\nZinc deficiencies occur more frequently in the winter, and this is when this disorder frequently begins.\nIt is now known that some individuals who, later in life are schizophrenic, had a prenatal zinc\ndeficiency, from their mother's diet and way of life.\nThe pineal gland in the brain normally has high levels of zinc, and weakening of this endocrine gland\nmay be a factor.\nMagnesium deficiency may also be involved, since schizophrenics have lower magnesium levels in their\nblood; and, when they recover from it, their magnesium levels are higher.\nHypoglycemia appears to be frequently involved in schizophrenia. A fair level supply of blood sugar is\nvital, if oxygen is going to be regularly provided to the brain. Yet it is believed that an undersupply of\noxygen is a key factor inducing the disorder. (See \"Hypoglycemia.\")\nHigh-quality food, with emphasis on slow-to-digest whole grain products, should be eaten.\nMineral and trace mineral imbalances exist in schizophrenics. A nourishing diet, along with vitamin/\nmineral supplementation is needed.\nSevere vitamin B (niacin) deficiency (pellagra), with its characteristics such as nervousness, loss of\n3\nmemory, confusion, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and hallucinations—resembles schizophrenia so\nclosely, that the two disorders probably are the same.\nHere is an interesting fact: When experiments were made on prisoners, and they were given no niacin\nfor extended periods of time before they were again given normal diets, it required 60 times as much\nniacin to return them to normal, in order to prevent pellagra.\nSevere deficiencies of other B complex vitamins can also produce schizoid symptoms. Severe B\n12\ndeficiency caused difficulty in concentration, poor memory, agitation, hallucinations, and manic or\nparanoid behavior. Biotin deficiency causes depression, lassitude, panic, and hallucinations.\nFaulty essential fatty acid metabolism or deficiency is another factor leading to schizophrenia. The\nremedy was 2-6 tbsp. of linseed oil, in divided doses, given daily. Flaxseed oil, wheat germ oil, or\nsunflower seed oil work just as effectively.\nAnother factor is heavy metal poisoning. This would include lead, copper, mercury,",

      "overview": "- Using orthodox psychiatric treatment, complete recovery is rare. The orthodox methods\nuse various tranquilizers, all with severe side effects—electroconvulsive shock therapy\nand psychotherapy. Orthodox remedial substances deplete many essential vitamins, are\nhighly toxic, damage brain tissue, and should be avoided.\n- Using natural remedies, which are far broader in scope, solutions are much more likely.\n- The primary areas of treatment are discussed above.\n- Go on a fruit and vegetable juice diet for a time. This will provide vitamins and minerals\nwhile keeping the blood sugar normal during the fast. Repeat short juice fasts or one\nlonger one for 4-6 weeks. Overly sweet fruit juices should be avoided or diluted 50-50\nwith water.\n- During this time, give massive doses of niacin, in the form of niacinamide (1,000-3,000\nmg with each meal; often as much as 25,000-30,000 mg per day). An equal amount of\nvitamin C should be given, B vitamins, especially pantothenic acid, and 3-5 tbsp. of\nbrewer's yeast.\n- After recovery, a large daily dose of niacinamide will have to be continued indefinitely.\n- Repeat: Do not give massive doses of niacin, but rather in the form of niacinamide.\n- Avoid all processed, junk, and fried foods. Do not use white flour or sugar foods. Stop\neating meat. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.\n- Eat a high-fiber diet, including plenty of fresh raw vegetables and quality protein.\nComplex carbohydrates in the diet are important to keep the blood sugar level.\n—Also see \"Mental Illness\" and \"Nerves, Strengthening\" for much additional information.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Serving Christ will place upon you no restriction that will not increase your\nhappiness.

      "overview": "- Dr. Bernard Rimland, a research psychologist in San Diego, found that 50% of his\npatients improved when placed on a megavitamin therapy.\n- The vitamins which especially helped were niacin (use as niacinamide), pantothenic\nacid, B and C. When improvement did not occur, additional B was given, along with\n6 6\nmagnesium, to offset the B , and then improvement was seen.\n6\n- As soon as the vitamin therapy ceased, the symptoms returned.\n- As a result of vitamin therapy, there was a reduction in tantrums, improved speech,\nbetter sleep patterns, increased alertness, and greater sociability.\n- Allan Cott, M.D., a New York psychiatrist, gave 200 mg of pangamic acid to autistic\nchildren, and decided improvement frequently occurred.\n- Give a nourishing diet high in vitamins and minerals.\n- The diet should be high fiber, of 50-75% raw fruits and vegetables.\n- No junk, processed, sugar, dairy, wheat, or white-flour foods of any kind should be\ngiven. Avoid fried and fatty foods and most meats.\n- Regular, moderate, exercise is important.\n- Use an elimination diet, to test for food allergies (see \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test\").\nENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord has not changed. He is true, merciful, compassionate, and faithful to\ndo what He says. Trust your life to Him! You will not be sorry. The future He offers you is a marvelous\none.\nSection 10\nMuscular-Skeletal\nPart 1\nBones\nFRACTURE (Broken Bone)\nSYMPTOMS—There may be extreme pain and tenderness in the injured area, a protruding bone, blood\nunder the skin, or swelling. There may be tingling, numbness, weakness, or paralysis below the fracture.\nA digit, or limb, may be at an abnormal angle or there may be pain at a specific place on a bone.\nA major fracture can cause a loss of pulse below the fracture, weakness, and inability to bear weight.\nCAUSES—A fracture is a crack or break in a bone. If the skin over the bone remains intact, it is a\nclosed or simple fracture; if the bone breaks the skin, it is a compound fracture.\nAccidents are not a common cause of broken bones, but the bone can also be weakened from\nosteoporosis, bone tumors, or metabolic disease. A weakened bone can break much more easily—even\nfrom a slip of the foot, a slight fall, or knocking against something.\nMalnutrition can also be involved. There can be a deficiency of calcium and/or magnesium, or there may\nbe an improper calcium/phosphorous ratio.\nA vibrating tuning fork can be placed against the area; if it causes pain, there is a fracture. X rays will\nconfirm whether it is a fracture or strain or sprain.\nIt is important that the bone be properly set, so it will not thenceforth be deformed, and not function as\nwell.\nOlder people do not absorb calcium and other minerals as well. This begins at 40, increases at 50, and\nvery much so beyond 60. It is believed that 200,000 hip fractures occur in people over 65 every year.\nVery often, this results from osteoporosis. The bone has somewhat hollowed out and the break more\neasily occurred.\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures than other people their age.\nWhen a break occurs, protein fibers form a bridgework between the two parts. Then calcium,\nphosphorous, and silica are deposited between the protein fibers.\n(Oddly enough, although phosphorous is needed for good bone formation, you will find, below, that it is\nimportant that you avoid phosphorous foods if you want strong bones. This is due to the fact that\nphosphorous is the one mineral which is abundantly found in food. Yet too much of it in a meal locks\ninto the calcium and removes it from the body.)\nFirst aid includes covering any wound and immobilizing, or splinting, the broken part in the position it\nwas found (so the problem will not worsen during transport). Take the person to a physician or the\nhospital, depending on the seriousness of the problem. Medical treatment involves placing the bones in\ntheir proper position and keeping them there while healing occurs.",

      "overview": "PREVENTIVE MEASURES—You cannot succeed in life without good bones. The bones most likely\nto be damaged by lack of care includes the jawbone, teeth, spine, hip, legs, and joints—all very\nimportant.\nThe objective is to achieve the highest possible bone mass before old age, and then to maintain it as long\nas possible. The following recommendations will help you fulfill these objectives:\nThe body requires calcium for many things, although bones are the most obvious need. For example,\nthere has to be a certain amount of calcium in the blood all the time. But when, for one reason or\nanother, the intake of certain minerals is not adequate, calcium is reabsorbed out of the bones in order to\nsupply other needs elsewhere. (One of these needs is providing calcium to a growing fetus during\npregnancy.) The bones become porous and \"honeycombed,\" and so fragile that breaks can more easily\noccur.\nA major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb\ncalcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of\ncertain hormones.\nObtaining enough nutrients, through diet and supplements, is important to maintaining strong bones.\nCalcium at 2,000 mg a day, magnesium at 1,000 mg per day, along with plant-derived colloidal minerals\nis needed.\nDigestive aids may be needed to help absorb this and other minerals. Especially important is sufficient\nacid in the stomach. Either betaine HCl (hydrochloric acid supplement) or lemon juice can be taken.\nCalcium and minerals are found abundantly in natural foods such as green leafy vegetables, carrot juice,\nand broccoli. The green leafy vegetables are generally the best sources. Along with them ranks sesame\nseeds. They are the best ratio of high calcium and low phosphorous of any food.\nA dietary calcium/phosphorous ratio of 2:1 is ideal, yet can only be attained by taking calcium\nsupplements. Here are some samples of this ratio of calcium to phosphorous in several foods: grain 1:8; red meat - 1:12; organ meat (liver, kidney) - 1:44; fish - 1:12; carbonated drinks - 1:8.\nPeople who eat meat and/or drink various colas and sodas obtain an immense amount of phosphorous.\nMillet is rich in calcium and magnesium. Almonds are high in calcium. The grains, amaranth and\nquinoa, are rich in minerals.\nFruitarians (people who only eat fruit) do not get enough calcium or the magnesium needed to help the\ncalcium be utilized.\nEat plenty of vegetables, raw and steamed.\nOther foods high in calcium include brown rice, kale, turnip greens, pinto beans, spirulina, collard\ngreens, and sesame seeds.\nThose with dentures tend to find vegetables difficult to eat. This results in a magnesium and calcium\ndeficiency. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw vegetable juices daily.\nLack of hydrochloric acid can be a cause of poor calcium (and other mineral) absorption.\nVitamin D is necessary (400-1,000 IU daily) for calcium absorption and repair. You need a basic 400 IU\ndaily. Sunlight will help you get part of what you need. (It is estimated that, on the average, only 10% of\nour daily requirement comes from sunlight; so other sources are also needed.) People over 65 may need\n800 units daily.\nIn one study, the more sunlight that was obtained by the test group, the less likelihood of osteoporosis\ndeveloping.\nBut excess doses of vitamin D, taken repeatedly, caused bone deterioration.\nPotassium is needed for cell formation, and vitamin C is necessary for the maintenance and development\nof bones. Vitamin C is called \"cell cement\"; it not only fights infection, but also holds your body\ntogether!\nGarlic, onions, and eggs contain sulfur, which is needed for healthy bones.\nManganese helps prevent osteoporosis (loss of bone mass). Rats on a low manganese diet developed\nporous bones.\nVitamin A helps increase the rate of bone growth. It is needed for proper digestion and assimilation of\nnutrients.\nVitamin B complex helps bone mass formation. B increases connective tissue strength in bones.\n6\nVitamin K (found in alfalfa, greens, and other chlorophyll foods) is needed to help the body synthesize\nosteocalcin, a special protein matrix which attracts calcium to the bones.\nFolic acid works to prevent the formation of toxic homocysteine from the essential amino acid,\nmethionine. The presence of homocysteine is involved in producing osteoporosis. (Alcohol, tobacco,\nand oral contraceptives increase folic acid deficiency.)\nTrace amounts of fluorides are also needed for bone development, but get it out of food—not from\nadditives, fluoridated water, toothpaste, etc.\nThe use of sodium fluoride, once thought to help treat osteoporosis, is now known to do the opposite.\nWhile it does increase bone mass in the spine, the bone is inferior in quality. Woman receiving the\ncompound were three times more likely to fracture an arm, leg, or hip than if they took a placebo. As\nlittle as 16 mg of sodium fluoride a day produces abnormal bone marrow cells. Adequate natural\nfluoride is in all food and water sources.\nCalcium supplements include calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium citrate, and calcium\ngluconate. All of these dissolve well, so they are absorbed adequately.\nThe mineral, calcium, has to be combined with another substance in order that it might be maintained in\na stable compound (calcium lactate is calcium plus lactic acid). Calcium carbonate includes a somewhat\nhigher percentage of elemental calcium than do the other forms, but all are beneficial. (Calcium\ncarbonate not only has the highest amount of calcium per tablet, it is the least expensive form.) As with\nmost other supplements, calcium in powder form is more economical than in tablets.\nIt is important that there be sufficient acid in the stomach, in order to absorb the calcium and other\nminerals from the food. An increasing lack of this acid, with age, is part of the reason why older people\ndo not absorb minerals as well and have poor bone structure. If necessary, take supplemental\nhydrochloric acid (betaine HCl) or lemon juice before each meal.\nHorsetail extract is a good source of silica, a vital mineral in the formation of bones. Horsetail, along\nwith oat straw, are consistently recommended as the best supplemental sources for absorbable silica.\nBoron and silica, both needed for good bone formation, are found in horsetail and oat straw. When your\nfriends come over to visit, invite them to have some savory oat straw tea with you!\nAlfalfa, comfrey, and slippery elm also help build strong bones.\nSeaweed (Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp) is an good source of many major minerals, and an\noutstanding source of the trace minerals.\nKelp, dulse, blue-green algae, hijiki, and kombu are rich in minerals. Wheat grass juice, green drink, and\nliquid chlorophyll are also.\nA summary of minerals which are needed includes silicon, boron, zinc, manganese, and copper, along\nwith calcium. (The body also needs phosphorous and magnesium, but too much of either one inhibits the\nbody from absorbing calcium. These minerals tend to compete with calcium for absorption in the blood\nand bone marrow. In the case of magnesium, though, normal supplementation should not be a problem.)\nThe following substances remove calcium and other minerals from the food before it is digested or leach\nit from the bones: white-sugar products, chocolate, caffeine products, and alcohol. Each of these are\nharmful to the bones.\nVinegar and meat acids also diminish bone mass. This is because other dietetic acids are later changed to\nalkaline forms after they leave the stomach, but not vinegar or meat acid (purines, uric acid, etc.)\nIt is well-known among medical professionals that sugar, coffee, caffeine, a high-meat diet, and smoking\nproduce osteoporosis and similar bone problems.\nOne study of middle-aged men and women with symptomatic osteoporosis were almost exclusively\nheavy smokers.\nA high-sugar diet causes calcium to be excreted in the urine. Excess sodium does this also.\nChocolate contains oxalic acid and prevents the absorption of calcium.\nWomen who drink coffee and soft drinks are more likely to have osteoporosis.\nCertain foods contain oxalic acid in moderate amounts (the cabbage family, which includes kale,\ncollards, almonds, and asparagus), and some contain it in still larger amounts (chard and, especially,\nspinach), and some in extremely large amounts (rhubarb, poke). Avoid oxalic acid foods, if you want\nstrong bones in your old age.\nSome foods contain the calcium inhibitor, solanine. These include tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell\npeppers, and tobacco.\nWhole grains contain phytin, a substance which tends to bind with calcium and prevent its absorption\nand use by the system. Some suggest that you take calcium supplements at different times than grains, to\ninsure its absorption. Those who are in desperate need for additional calcium will want to take this\nadvice. They can take calcium powder near bedtime, when it is best absorbed. Calcium also aids in\nsleeping, for it tends to relax the muscles.\nHigh phosphorous foods tend to compete with calcium and also combine with it, locking it out. Such\nfoods include soft drinks, high-protein animal foods, and yeast products.\nCola drinks are especially harmful in this respect. Cola drinks, frankly, are a terrible concoction: (1)\nThey contain an acid which is stronger than vinegar. (2) The acidity is masked by an excessive amount\nof sugar, which itself leaches calcium from bones. (3) Cola drinks are basically phosphoric acid, or a\nstrong acid in a phosphorous medium. Phosphorous locks directly onto calcium, and carries it out of the\nbody, making it unavailable to the body. A tooth placed in a glass of cola drink will melt away entirely\nwithin a few hours.\nWhite-flour products contain chlorine, which is harmful to the bones.\nDo not use foods with preservatives, because of their phosphorous content.\nDrugs, such as diuretics, inhibit calcium assimilation.\nDo not eat meat or vinegar if you want strong, healthy, joints. A diet high in animal protein tends to\ncauses the body to excrete increased amounts of protein. Beef, for example, contains 25 times as much\nphosphorous as calcium! A high-meat diet will invariably lead to calcium deficiencies.\nA study conducted by The Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that vegetarian women had\nsignificantly less bone loss than women who eat meat.\nAvoid large meals and overeating. Chew your food well, so it will be properly absorbed.\nThe amount of protein a man eats may influence the level of calcium in his body. Tests at Wisconsin\nUniversity, confirmed by other studies, revealed that a high-protein diet causes calcium loss. Eskimos,\non their high-protein diets, had lower bone mineral levels than Americans. In the 60-90 age bracket,\nbone loss in meat eaters was 35%; in vegetarians it was 18%.\nExcessive fat intake reduces bone mass. On test animals, the daily loss of calcium on the high-fat diet\nwas more than four times as much as on the low-fat diet.\nThe harder the fat was, before eating, the more calcium loss it caused.\nExercise strengthens the bones. It causes the body to strengthen the insides of the bones, by increasing\nthe webbing connections within them. Exercise definitely increases bone density. The body must have\nregular weight-bearing exercise, such as walking. When this occurs, more minerals are laid down in the\nbones, to strengthen them—especially where you need it the most: the bones of the legs, hips, and spine.\nConversely, a lack of exercise accelerates the loss of bone mass. It is believed that lack of activity in old\nage is a factor in the increased levels of bone loss in those years.\nDaily exercise outdoors provides vitamin D and stimulates osteoblastic cells. Exercise increases muscle\ntone, strengthens muscles, prevents disuse atrophy and further demineralization of the bones.\nNASA research experts say the best activity for maintaining bone mass is gravitational: walking or\njogging. When you are not pushing against gravity very much (because you are sitting in a chair or lying\nin bed), you are tending to lose bony material. Try to walk at least 20 minutes a day out-of-doors.\n\"Strain changes\" are important in building and maintaining bone mass. How often you do it is more\nimportant than the intensity when it is done. Try to maintain the bounce of earlier years: keep that spring\nin your step; put a little strain on your body and muscles every so often. Do this more moderately as you\nage, but keep it up.\nBed rest tends to cause a negative calcium balance. Bones placed in plaster casts develop localized\nosteoporosis, regardless of the diet, hormonal balance, etc. It is called \"disuse osteoporosis.\" Exercise is\nvital to healthy bones.\nToo much calcium supplementation, during bone healing (when in bed or confined to a chair while\nrecovering from a fracture, etc.), can induce kidney stone formation during the immobile period while\nthe cast is on. The problem is that the person is not active enough at that time.\nAcidophilus in the large bowel is needed for the digestion of food. It is also needed to produce vitamins\nB , B , and folic acid, all of which are needed to make bone mass. Lactic acid foods, such as\n6 12\nsauerkraut, are very helpful.\nSupplementing your diet with two herbs, suma and dong quai, will help regulate hormonal imbalances.\nSuma contains sitosterol. This increases natural estrogen production without stimulating an oversupply.\nFlaxseed oil also helps the body produce needed hormones.\nAvoid chilling. Rats exposed to cold stress developed bone mass which was less dense.\nDistilled water is an excellent way to obtain pure water. But keep in mind that you must also be\nincluding proper minerals in your diet, including some kelp or dulse, to replace the minerals lost by\ndrinking distilled water. (Distilled water is chemically hungry, and locks onto some minerals in your\nbody when you drink it.)\nDo not take estrogen drugs because, although it increases bone mass somewhat, it also places the user at\nhigh risk for cancer. Estrogen therapy initially increases bone formation, but eventually leads to\ndecreased bone mass and lack of response to the parathyroid hormone. Taking estrogen also increases\nthe risk of breast cancer, stroke, and myocardial infarction (heart attack).\nIf you take the thyroid hormone or an anticoagulant drug, increase the amount of calcium you take by 2550%.\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures.\n—Also see \"Fractures\" and \"Osteoporosis\" for additional information on factors affecting bone\nformation and loss.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God's faithful ones are in the majority. They have all heaven on their side, in\nthe battle to fulfill God's will for their lives and resist temptation to sin. Go to Jesus and surrender to\nHim, and He can give you all the help you need.",

Cling to God and obey His Written Word, and you will have the help that He sees is best for you.\nOSTEOPOROSIS (Brittle Bones)\nSYMPTOMS—There is skeletal pain (especially in the hip and back), deformities (such as a hump in\nthe upper back), a stooping and rounding of the shoulders, increased susceptibility to fractures, and a\nreduction in height. Do you find that your clothes are getting bigger?\nUnfortunately, symptoms are frequently not very obvious until the bones are quite weak.\nCAUSES—Osteoporosis is a reduction in the total mass of bone, so that the remaining bone is fragile or\n\"brittle.\" This weakening continues to increase. The bones actually become thinner. Bone formation is\nslowed; bone reabsorption increases, causing this loss of bone mass.\nAbout 25-30% of all white females in the U.S. reveal symptoms of this condition, especially after\nmenopause. Older men, above 50, also have it, but to a lesser degree than women. Osteoporosis is rare in\nblack men, but somewhat more common in black women.\nWhite women in America tend to lose 30-40% of their bone mass between 55-70.\nBut younger women should be watchful; research indicates that osteoporosis often begins early in life\nrather than just after menopause. (However, bone loss definitely accelerates after that time, due to a drop\nin estrogen levels.)\nPeople with larger and denser bones tend to have less trouble with osteoporosis later in life. They started\nout with more bony structure.\nA major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb\ncalcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of\ncertain hormones.\nStill other factors include late puberty, early menopause (natural or artificially induced), chronic liver or\nkidney disease, and the long-term use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and antiseizure medications.\nSmoking is an excellent way to damage your bones.\nCompression fractures in the vertebrae occur as bone loss advances. This causes a loss in height and\ncrowds the nerves, resulting in pain. Nerve damage is possible. Older women often have a hump in the\nupper back as a result.\nOsteoporosis can also result in loose teeth which fall out, because the jawbone has weakened.\nThere are two types of this disease:\nOsteoporosis, Type I, is thought to be caused by hormonal changes, especially a loss of estrogen.\nOsteoporosis, Type II, traces its cause to dietary factors (lack of calcium, vitamin D, etc.), poor\nabsorption, and intake of foods which block absorption.",

There may be delayed walking, tetany, bony beads along the ribs, and\ndecaying teeth.\nIn adults, in addition to the above symptoms, aching joints and generalized weakness may also occur.\nCAUSES—Rickets is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D in children. When it occurs in adults, it is\ncalled osteomalacia.\nIt can result either from not obtaining enough vitamin D in the food or from not getting enough sunlight.\nWhen sunlight strikes the skin, oils there are irradiated, reabsorbed into the blood stream and carried to\nthe liver, where it is stored and sent throughout the body to strengthen the bones. Without this vitamin,\nthe body cannot absorb calcium and phosphorous.\nThe bones cannot retain calcium, so they become soft. This results in deformities when the bones are\nrequired to support weight. Yet weight gain and growth will usually be normal.\nThe adult form, osteomalacia, generally occurs during pregnancy or breast-feeding. But it may also be\ncaused by a kidney disease or defect, calcium deficiency, a lack of vitamin D, or inability to utilize it. It\ncan also occur in those who do not obtain enough sunshine or whose bodies are so low in fat that they\ncannot produce the bile needed to absorb the vitamin D in the food.\nA deficiency of vitamin C can make the bones less able to retain bone-building minerals.\nOsteomalacia is often misdiagnosed as osteoporosis (which see).",

There may be a sharp burning or grinding pain or it may feel like a toothache.\nThere may be stiffness and/or pain when moving a joint.\nCAUSES—Arthritis is the inflammation of one or more joints. The word, \"arthritis,\" covers a number of\ndisorders, some of which are covered in this present article, which deals the most completely with the\nproblem.\nThe most common forms are osteoarthritis (this article), rheumatoid arthritis (which see), gout (which\nsee), and ankylosing spondylitis (which see). Other diseases which also infect the joints include lupus,\nLyme disease (which see), psoriatic arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome (which see), and Reiter's syndrome.\nThe various types of arthritis affect the synovial (movable) joints, which are the fingers, toes, wrists,\nelbows, hips, and knees. There are also joints between the bones of the spine. Each joint has cartilage\ncovering over the end of the bone and is bathed continually in synovial fluid, in a capsule.\nOsteoarthritis: Cartilage is a smooth, soft, pearly tissue. Among other places, it is found on the ends of\nthe long bones, and provides a smooth surface for the bones in the joints to slide against.\nAs a result of years of wear and improper diet, this cartilage becomes pitted, thin, and may even\ndisappear. There is pain and stiffness. Older people experience this most often, and it generally occurs in\nthe weight-bearing joints (hips and knees).\nThe connecting ligaments and muscles, which hold the joint together, become weaker. The joint may\nbecome deformed. There may be pain, but usually no swelling. Later, bony outgrowths may develop.\nOsteoarthritis rarely occurs before 40, but affects most people after 60. Sometimes it is so mild as to be\nunnoticed. Women have it three times as often as men.\nFor information on rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, and gout, see their respective articles.\nHere is a brief comparative overview:\nIn osteoarthritis, the cartilage at the end of bones wears down and produces rough, hard, edges of bone\nwhich cause trouble. This generally begins after 40, and 16 million in the U.S. have it.\nIn rheumatoid arthritis (which see), the cartilage at the end of bones is destroyed, and is replaced with\nscar tissue. Then swelling occurs, and the joints may eventually fuse together. While osteoarthritis only\naffects individual joints, rheumatoid arthritis ultimately affects all synovial joints in a person's body.\nThis problem usually begins between 25 and 50, and 3 million in the U.S. are afflicted with it.\nGout (which see) produces extreme pain, usually starting in a big toe (or other smaller toe or finger\njoint). This generally does not begin until 40 or after, and 1.5 million experience it. Over 90% are men.\nThe spondyloarthropathies affect the spine, causing pain, stiffness, joint fusion, and changes in posture.\nThe most common is ankylosing spondylitis (which see). These difficulties generally start between 20\nand 40, and afflict a total of 2.5 million. Men have it over twice often.\nInfectious arthritis is the result of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within a joint (most frequently\nbacteria or fungi, especially from candida [which see]). The infection can come from injury, surgery, or\ndisease. There are body aches, chills, and fever, along with throbbing pain in the affected joint. The pain\nand infection may spread to other joints. It may strike at any age, and 100,000 in the U.S. have it.\nThe following suggestions will help one deal with a variety of arthritic conditions:",

      "overview": "- Arthritis is the result of a complex of nutritional deficiencies.\n- A dietary calcium/phosphorous ratio of 2:1 is ideal, yet can only be attained by taking\ncalcium supplements (see \"Bones, Strengthening\"). Meat is especially bad; it has a ratio of\n1:12 (organ meats, such as liver and kidney) is 1:44. So the more meat you eat, the more\ncalcium you need. It is as simple as that.\n- In addition, there is all the acid purines and uric acid in meat. Eventually this\nhodgepodge of acids collects in the joints, to such a degree that the bone is eaten away, the\nbursa becomes inflamed, etc.\n- The sulfur-containing foods (asparagus, eggs, garlic, and onions) helps repair bone,\ncartilage, and connective tissue, and aids in the absorption of calcium.\n- Eat green leafy vegetables, whole grains, oatmeal, and brown rice. These supply vitamin\nK,\n- Eat fresh pineapple frequently. The bromelain in it is good for reducing inflammation. It\nmust be fresh, since freezing or canning destroys the enzyme.\n- The most beneficial vegetables include celery, parsley, potatoes, alfalfa, wheat grass,\ngarlic, comfrey, and endive.\n- The most beneficial fruits include bananas, pineapples, sour apples, and sour cherries.\n- Foods containing the amino acid, histidine, include wheat, rye, and rice. Histidine helps\nremove metals, and many arthritics have high levels of copper and iron in their bodies.\n- Eat some form of fiber, such as oat bran, rice bran, flaxseed, etc.\n- Vegetable juice therapy is especially helpful for arthritics, and especially for those with\nrheumatoid arthritis.\n- Repeated juice fasts of 4-6 weeks are recommended, along with about 2 months of an\nextremely nourishing diet. The alkaline action of raw juices and vegetable broth dissolves\nthe accumulation of deposits around the joints and in other tissues.\n- Green juice, mixed with carrot, celery, red beet juice, and vegetable broths daily, are\nspecifics for arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.\n- Drink raw potato juice. Slice a potato, with the skin on, cut it into thin slices and place in\na large glass. Fill the glass with cold water and let it stand overnight. Drink the water the\nnext morning on an empty stomach.\n- Potato juice can also be made in an electric juicer. Make it fresh, dilute it 50-50 with\nwater, and drink first thing in the morning.\n- Milk, wheat, eggs, corn, and pork have been shown to produce arthritic symptoms.\n- Vitamin C is necessary, to prevent the capillary walls in the joints from breaking down\nand causing bleeding, swelling, and pain. Vitamin C is vital to joint health.\n- Folic acid, vitamin B , and iron in food help treat the anemia which frequently\n12\naccompanies arthritis.\n- A British research study revealed that arthritic patients had a low pantothenic acid level\nin their blood. This important B vitamin should be included in the diet.\n- Take 6-8 bromelain tablets a day or, better yet, eat part of a fresh pineapple each day.\nThis helps reduce or eliminate swelling and inflammation in the soft tissues and the joints\naffected by rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Helpful herbs include black cohosh, parsley, slippery elm, alfalfa, peppermint, buckthorn\nbark, ragwort, burdock root, and chaparral.\n- To summarize part of this nutritional data, treatment of arthritis should include calcium\n(2000 mg per day; assuming no meat is eaten); vitamin C, to bowel tolerance; B (100 mg,\n6\ntwice a day); B (450 mg, twice a day); vitamin E (1000 IU daily); copper (2mg per day);\n3\nselenium (300 mcg per day); and zinc (50 mg, three times a day).\n- DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is by-product of the wood industry. It can be applied to the\nskin above the affected area—to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and promote healing. Only\nobtain it from a health food store.\n- Reduce the amount of fat in your diet. Avoid dairy products and fatty foods.\n- Do not eat meat. The purines and uric acid in it inflame arthritic conditions.\n- Avoid salt, caffeine, tobacco, paprika, and citrus fruits.\n- Do not eat anything with added sugar.\n- A high-protein diet induced arthritis in research on pigs. The first symptoms occurred\nwithin a week.\n- Some arthritics are sensitive to foods in the nightshade (solanaceous) family. This\nincludes eggplant, white potato, bell pepper, tomato, and tobacco. They have solanine,\nwhich interferes with muscle activity. In one research study, 85% of arthritics were\nbenefited when they stopped using those foods. These foods are sometimes included in\nother foods as \"natural ingredients.\"\n- Chocolate, tea, coffee, and cortisone injections may also cause problems.\n- Do not use iron supplements or vitamin/mineral supplements that contain iron. Get your\niron from food (blackstrap molasses, broccoli, etc.)\n- Take a free-form amino acid complex regularly, to help repair tissue damage.\n- Arthritic patients frequently have liver disorders. This can deter the conversion of\ncarotene into vitamin A. So additional carotene-rich foods should be eaten.\n- Kombucha tea has nutrients needed to strengthen connective tissue; so it tends to relieve\npain, increase energy, and improve mobility in arthritics.\n- Exercise is very important in both preventing and treating arthritis. Joints which are not\nused tend to stiffen. Practice bending all your joints (not merely the affected ones) in\ndifferent positions, 5-10 times twice a day.\n- If you are unable to exercise your joints because the pain is too great, carry out an\nexercise program in a tub of warm water (93o-98o F.).\n- Good posture is also important. Poor posture does not distribute weight evenly and can\nintensify the problem.\n- Sleeping in a sleeping bag often reduces stiffness and pain in the morning. An electric\nblanket may also help. Keeping the body evenly warm at night is important.\n- If the blood is too acidic, the cartilage in the joints can dissolve.\n- Place cold gel packs on inflamed joints, to relieve pain. Alternate with applications of\nheat.\n- Charcoal poultices may be applied to affected joints.\n- Hot packs applied to stiff joints tend to decrease morning stiffness.\n- Hot tubs and baths also provide relief.\n- In the morning, take a hot shower, to help relieve morning stiffness.\n- Hot castor oil packs are very useful. Heat castor oil in a pan, but do not boil it. Dip white\ncotton cloth into it, till saturated. Apply it to the affected area, and cover with a piece of\nplastic which is larger than the cloth. Place a heating pad over the area and keep it warm\nfor 1½ to 2 hours.\n- An arthritis liniment may be made in this way: Mix 1 pint alcohol, 1/4 ounce menthol,\nand ½ ounce camphor. Rub it on the affected joints, twice a day.\n- A 50-50 mix of mineral oil and alcohol is another formula. You can add a tbsp. of\nwintergreen oil to the mixture, if you wish.\n- The following poultice has been used with good results on swollen joints: Take 3 tbsp. of\ngranulated slippery elm bark, 1 tbsp. of lobelia, 2 tbsp. of mullein, 1 spoonful of cayenne,\nand mix in a bowl. Add hot water to make a paste. Spread it on a cloth and cover the\nswollen joints. Over it, wrap a plastic sheet and then a dry towel. Leave it on for ½ to 1\nhour or less, if burning sensation becomes unbearable.\n- Mix eucalyptus oil with water, and rub on the affected area. Wrap the joint in plastic\nwrap, and apply moist heat with hot towels.\n- Reduce stress in your life. Worry, anger, and similar emotions weakens your body and\nhelps induce arthritic problems.\n- Chlamydia (which see) has been linked to a form of arthritis that affects young women.\nIn one study, half the women with unexplained arthritis were found to have chlamydia.\n- Overweight increases strain on the joints. Arthritics should try to keep their weight\nslightly below average.\n- Avoid immunizations. Various immunizations have brought on arthritis.\n- Food allergies can cause neck and shoulder pain, imitative of arthritis.\n- Silicone gel breast implants can cause arthritis-like symptoms, and induce lupus and\nscleroderma. Antibodies develop which attack collagen.\n- In its early stages, ulcerative colitis (which see) can produce arthritic-like symptoms.\n- Lyme disease (which see) can appear to be arthritis.\n- Lupus (which see), an autoimmune disease, can produce arthritis-like symptoms.\n—Also see \"Arthritis—2,\" \"Rheumatoid Arthritis—1,\" which contains additional material on Arthritis.\n—Also see the author's book, Arthritis and Rheumatism (see order sheet), detailing the findings of 63\nresearch studies on various arthritic and rheumatic conditions.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Think back over the past and recall to mind all the ways God has helped you\nthrough the years. Praise Him for what He has done, and continues to do for you. Stay close to Him and\ntrust the future to Him. He will not fail you, even though you may not understand all the workings of\nprovidence.\nARTHRITIS—2; RHEUMATOID GOUT (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nDIET AND LIFESTYLE—The diet must be specially nourishing and digestible. See \"Emaciation.\" A\nwarm, rather dry, and uniform climate is most desirable.\nGENERAL MEASURES—Carefully graduated cold applications, preceded by very short hot\napplications; Fomentation to spine or the Radiant Heat Bath for 3-5 minutes and the sunbath, followed\nby Cold Mitten Friction are especially suitable; massage; Hot Abdominal Pack.\nFEVER—Prolonged Neutral Bath at 920 F., Fomentation to spine followed by Cold Mitten Friction or\nWet Towel Rub.\nFREQUENT PULSE—Cold Compress or Ice Bag over heart for 15-20 minutes, 3 times a day.\nPAIN IN JOINTS—Revulsive Compresses followed by cotton poultice; vapor bath to the area.\nNEURALGIA OF HANDS—Hot Hand Bath followed by cotton poultice\nRADIATING PAINS—Fomentation to spine, 3 times a day, with well-protected (plastic covered)\nHeating Compress during the interval between; Revulsive Compress to spine.\nNUMBNESS AND TINGLING OF HANDS AND FEET—Fomentation to spine, Hot or Alternate\nSponging of limbs, repeated 3 times a day.\nMUSCULAR CRAMPS—Fomentation or hot immersion of affected parts, two or more times daily;\nduring interval between, Hot Sponging; firm bandaging. Protect him from chills.\nJOINT DEFORMITIES—For thickening of synovial membranes, or accumulation of fluid in joints or\nbursa, apply Alternate Douche; Alternate Compress. Apply, to joint, a dry flannel bandage or cotton\npoultice.\nCAUTIONS—To painful joints, avoid cold douches, long sweating processes, and prolonged general\napplications.\nMETHOD—Improve the general health by using general tonic measures, especially using carefully\nGraduated Cold Baths and massage.\n—Also see \"Arthritis—1,\" \"Gout—1.\"",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Vague pain, stiffness, weight loss, numbness, and tingling of the hands and feet may\nprecede its onset.\nSwelling, stiffness, redness, and often crippling pain in joints, which eventually may fuse together.\nThere is fatigue, anemia, weight loss, and fever.\nAffected joints sound like crinkling cellophane. In contrast, osteoarthritis joints sound like popping,\nclicking, or banging. Joints of the hands, elbows, knees, and ankles are most commonly involved.\nUpon awakening in the morning, there may be a joint stiffness which lasts an hour or longer. Swelling\nwill occur in a specific finger or wrist joints, and also around the joints. Pain may, or may not, be\npresent.\nThe condition can worsen or remain the same for years, and later worsen again.\nCAUSES—Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory arthritis. It is an autoimmune disorder. So\nmany acids, purines, etc., have collected in the joints; and the calcium supply has been so low for so\nlong, that the body gets mixed up—and begins attacking the synovial membranes in the joints. Cartilage,\nnearby tissues, and even the bone surfaces are destroyed.\nThis damaged area is then replaced with scar tissue, which tends to fuse together the joints—making\nthem immovable.\nOddly enough, this form of arthritis most commonly occurs between the ages of 35 and 45, but may\noccur at any age. It also occurs even in children. Two-thirds of the 3 million Americans who have RA\nare women. Among those under 18, 70,000 have it, most of them girls.\nCauses include poor nutrition, bacterial infection, and/or physical or emotional stress. Stress seems to be\nthe active agent which initially brings it on. Exposure, overwork, or acute infections can also do it.\nUnlike osteoarthritis (which see), which only affects joints here or there, RA affects all the synovial\njoints in the body.\nIn the first year after the disease appears, 75% improve without any treatment at all. Therefore natural\ntreatments should help the situation even more. Keep in mind that 10% of those with RA become\ndisfigured in one way or another. So this is a problem which is worth taking the time and effort to reduce\nor eliminate.\nThe likelihood of remission is greater early in the course of the disease. Each attack seems to be worse\nthan those preceding it.",

      "overview": "- It is important that you also read the article on \"Arthritis.\" It contains much important\ninformation which also applies to rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Take calcium, magnesium, selenium, copper, B , histidine, and bromelain every day.\n6\n- Do not take iron supplements (such as ferrous sulfate, which is commonly given for\nanemia). These will intensify RA and arthritis.\n- Fasting brings temporary relief to RA, but the pain, swelling, and stiffness tend to return\na few days after the fast is ended. However, some recommend a longer vegetable juice and\nvegetable broth fast of two or more weeks as having more lasting effects.\n- Food allergies can be involved. One study showed that 86% of a group of rheumatoid\narthritics could trace the onset of their problem to allergies; most common were soy\nproducts, milk, eggs, coffee, and sugar foods. Try avoiding all those foods. (See\n\"Arthritis\" for other helpful and problem foods.)\n- One research study noted that peoples who use large quantities of wheat, rye, and oats\ntend to have high rates of RA.\n- People with RA were found to have lower blood levels of folic acid, protein, and zinc\nthan other people.\n- Lose weight, to reduce the strain on your joints.\n- Stretch nylon gloves, worn at night, help keep the hands warm. Better yet, keep your\narms and hands under the covers at night.\n- Deep breathing exercises out-of-doors helps those with RA.\n- Alternating hot and cold baths help. Give 6 minutes for the hot and 4 minutes for the\ncold, to increase blood flow to the area.

After the swelling subsides, the skin tends to itch and peel.\nDuring attacks, there often is loss of appetite, stomach and intestinal problems, fever, and decreased\nurine output.\nCAUSES—Gout is an acute type of inflammatory arthritis, and occurs most often in people who are\noverweight or eat rich foods, such as meat, gravies, spices, and alcohol.\nThe body cannot handle all the purines and other acids in the meat, and so these products settle in the\nbody. Uric acid is the end-product of the breakdown of purine compounds.\nGout typically attacks the smaller joints of the feet and hands, especially the big toe. Uric acid salts\ncrystallize in the joint, and produce swelling, redness, and a sensation of heat and extreme pain.\nUnlike most forms of arthritis, gout affects men in 90% of the cases. It generally does not begin until\nafter 35 years of age; peak age of onset is 45. Women who have it are generally post-menopausal.",

      "overview": "- Diet changes, water drinking, and weight control are all very important.\n- The amount of urates in the blood is keyed to dietary intake and the amount of body\nweight. Many in middle life who initially experience the pain of gout are overweight.\n- Those with gout need to reduce to 10-15% below calculated normal weight. However,\nweight reduction must be done gradually, so as not to stir up more urates and temporarily\nincrease the number of gout attacks.\n- Do not fast when you have gout. Doing so greatly increases the amount of uric acids in\nthe blood.\n- Drink at least 2 quarts of water a day between gout attacks, not only to get rid of the uric\nacid, but also to reduce the likelihood of kidney damage and kidney stones. Those with\ngout tend to have kidney stones.\n- A high-carbohydrate diet tends to increase uric acid excretion. In contrast, a high-fat diet\ndecreases excretion and may bring on a gout attack (even though they may be unsaturated\nfats). Keep your diet low in protein and fat.\n- A vegetarian diet is the best program for a person with gout.\n- Avoid excessive food yeast.\n- Eating cherries is very helpful. The uric acid level in the blood decreases and the attacks\ntend to stop. They can be any type of cherries, and either fresh or canned (½ pound per\nday). One or two tbsp. of cherry concentrate can be taken instead. If canned cherries are\nused, only use water-packed ones; most have too much sugar and additives.\n- Overeating tends toward gout.\nHere are foods high in purines: liver, brains, kidneys, heart, anchovies, sardines, meat\nextract, fish roes, herring, consommé, mussels, and sweet breads.\n- Here are foods of lesser purine content: fowl, fish (except those listed above), other\nseafoods, and other meats.\n- Here are foods of moderate amounts: whole-grain cereals, lentils, peas, beans, asparagus,\nmushrooms, oatmeal, cauliflower, and spinach.\n- Here are the foods which have only small amounts of purines; foods containing\nnegligible amounts of purines: vegetables, fruits, refined cereals, cereal products, eggs,\nmilk, cheese.\n- There are cases in which drinking large amounts of milk or eating lots of tomatoes\nproduced gout.\n- Do not take any alcoholic beverage. Alcohol increases uric acid production and reduces\nexcretion of urates.\n- Direct injury to a joint, tending toward gout, can bring on an acute attack.\n- It is known that the skin can excrete uric acid, so baths will help.\n- During acute attacks, keep the affected joint elevated and at rest.\n- Hot fomentations for 15 minutes every 3 hours, to help relieve pain. But, to reduce pain,\nsome do better using cold applications.\n- Mud packs, applied to the affected area, will absorb a fair amount of the uric acid.\n- Charcoal is very helpful. Take it by mouth (12-16 tablets daily), and also lay charcoal\npacks on the area.\n- A compress of comfrey root or leaves, blended with water, helps relieve gout pain.\nApply for two hours or more, or overnight.\n- Burdock will help clean uric acid deposits from the joints and other areas. Kelp, red\nclover, and yucca help eliminate uric acid and other toxins.\n- Colchicine is the primary drug medication for gout. But it causes nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, cramping, hair loss, anemia, liver damage, and decreased leukocytes and\nplatelets. Natural remedies can do the job better.\n- A number of drugs increase uric acid levels, so it is best to avoid drugs. Diuretic drugs\nare especially bad.\n—See \"Arthritis\" for much more information.\n—Also see the author's book, Arthritis and Rheumatism (see order sheet), detailing the findings of 63\nresearch studies on various arthritic and rheumatic conditions.\n—Also see \"Gout—2,\" \"Arthritis—1\" and \"Rheumatoid Gout.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Could the curtain be rolled back, you would see the entire universe intently\nwatching what is occurring on earth.

Immense pain in the affected area, which frequently limits motion.\nIt most often occurs in shoulder joint and less often in the hip joint, in the elbows, or feet.\nCAUSES—Bursitis is the inflammation of the liquid-filled sac, called a bursa, found within joints,\nmuscles, tendons, and bones. These sacs normally help muscular movement occur.\nOverstimulation of the bursa causes the synovial membrane to produce excess fluid. This distends the\nbursa, which causes the discomfort.\nInjury to the area is a common cause, but chilling of the area during the day, especially at night can also\nlead to it. Bursitis can also be caused by chronic overuse, calcium deposits in the bursa wall, reactions to\ncertain foods or airborne allergies. In some instances, suddenly working tight muscles can do it; it is\ncalled a stretched muscle.\nAccording to where it is centered, bursitis has many names: housemaid's knee, tennis elbow, policeman's\nheel, frozen shoulder, or beat knee.\nThe lowly bunion (caused by friction in tight shoes) is also a form of bursitis. A bursa sac on the joint of\nthe big toe becomes inflamed.\nAthletes and older people are most likely to get bursitis, but it can happen to anyone at any age.\nWhat is the difference between bursitis and tendonitis (which see)? Both produce pain in the shoulder,\netc.\nBursitis generally exhibits a dull persistent ache that increases with movement. Tendonitis causes a\nsharp pain during movement, and is most likely to be caused to over-reaching for something. But it can\nalso be caused by calcium deposits pressing against a tendon. There is no swelling and fluid\naccumulation, as with bursitis. See \"Tendonitis\" for more on that problem.",

Do this for at least 12 minutes. This is especially good for pain in the inner leg\n(rather than the front where the shin splints occur).\n- Massage the area near the shin splint pain, but not on it. If you rub on it, the\ninflammation will worsen. Sit on the floor and lightly stroke on the sides several times.\nThen wrap your hands around the calf and, with your finger tips, stroke deeply around on\neach side of the shin from ankle to knee. Do the entire area, pressing as deeply as possible.\n- Try to correct flat feet or very high arches, if you can. They can also cause shin splints.\nPREVENTION—Try to avoid a lot of hard activity on unyielding surfaces, such as concrete. Even\ncarpet on concrete can cause problems. Grass or dirt is better than asphalt; asphalt is better than\nconcrete.\nWear good, comfortable shoes; and when they start wearing down, buy new ones.\nStretch your calves and Achilles tendon frequently.

Sometimes this\nhappens several times a night.\nCAUSES—Restless leg syndrome is not a serious neurological disorder, and moving the legs or walking\naround a little terminates the sensation for a time.\nWomen and older people have the syndrome more often than men, and a full 5% of the U.S. population\nhave experienced it. Yet the cause is not certain. Mild weakness of the legs may be present.\nIt seems to be related to iron deficiency, exposure to cold, stress, heredity, and motion sickness. It also\nseems to be related to pulmonary disease, stomach operations, diabetes, and uremia.\nVery likely, there is a circulatory factor involved: Blood circulation is impeded in the legs or blood is\nbeing drawn in excessive amounts, to care for a problem in the trunk.\nIt is obvious that the solutions, listed below, are keyed to improving leg circulation and bettering the",

      "overview": "- Move your feet back and forth for a few moments.\n- Rotate the feet back and forth momentarily.\n- Get up and walk about for a couple minutes. This seems to work best at night, when you\nhave been trying to sleep.\n- Change position in bed. It has been noted that some people experience the problem more\noften when they sleep in certain positions.\n- Some find using a heating pad helps; others do better by soaking their feet in cold water.\nLONGER-TERM CARE—It is known that drinking coffee is a significant factor, so stop using\ncaffeine products.\nStop smoking. Studies reveal it is also a factor.\nSome studies have shown folic acid and vitamin E to be helpful.\nThere may be a relationship between this problem and iron deficiency. But be sure your iron is from\nfood, not chemical supplements, or you can initiate other physical problems.\nIt would be well to improve your general diet and take a multivitamin supplement daily.\nDo not eat much salt.\nNever eat big meals before bedtime. This draws the blood to the stomach, so that you do not rest well. It\ncan also lead to a nighttime heart attack.\nWalk before going to bed. Better yet, walk outside in the fresh air. This will help you sleep better.\nSome sponge the legs with cold water.\nOthers take a warm soaking bath before bedtime. Do not let your bare feet touch the cold floor\nafterward.\nYou may wish to wear knee socks.\nDo not take sleeping drugs. They only add another problem to your life.\nPossibly massage your legs just before climbing into bed.\nGet plenty of rest.\nReduce your overall stress level.\nAvoid prolonged exposure to the cold, which increases the need for additional healing blood to the legs.\nAvoid overusing the legs. Strenuous exercise seems to increase the problem.\nAvoid narrow, pointed, shoes and also high heels.\nSluggish venous blood flow may be problem. Do not cross your legs; lie down every so often and rest\nyour legs. See \"Varicose Veins\" for more information.\nENCOURAGEMENT—All heaven unites in praising God. Let us learn the song of the angels now,\nthat we may later sing it when we join their shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist, \"While I live\nwill I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.\"\nMUSCLE CRAMPS (Muscle Pain, Leg Cramps; Charley Horse)\nSYMPTOMS—A pain in a body muscle, most often in the legs (especially the calf muscles) or feet.\nCAUSES—Muscle cramps may occur at any age. Between the ages of 15 to 80, a full 50% of people\nwill, at some time, have pain or cramps in the legs. Leg pains in children are frequent enough that they\nare called \"growing pains.\"\nReduced blood supply to the legs is part of the problem. Another is an imbalance in the levels of calcium\nand magnesium in the body or a deficiency of vitamin E.\nBut other causes have also been noted: arthritis, anemia, tobacco usage, inactivity, poor circulation, too\nmuch or too little exercise, muscle injury, allergy, fibromyalgia, arteriosclerosis, dehydration,\nhypothyroidism, heat stroke, and varicose veins. Diuretic drugs for heart problems, or hypertension can\nalso induce cramps. Those who have had part of the stomach removed tend to have muscle cramps\nthereafter.\nIf cramping occurs when walking and stops when you cease, it may be impaired circulation and nothing\nmore.\nIf leg cramps occur during pregnancy, they may be caused by hormone changes, fatigue, uterine\npressure, chilling, or muscle tenseness.\nA calcium deficiency can make the leg muscles trigger-happy; the contractions in the muscles are\nstronger.\nLeg cramps in older people may be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the circulatory system. Turn to\nthe articles on heart and blood vessels, and see your physician. Vitamin E (600-800 IU daily) is very\nhelpful.",

      "overview": "- Massage the muscles and use heat to relieve pain.\n- A heating pad may be applied to the area. For some, alternate hot and cold compresses\nwork better (heat for 6 minutes and cold for 30 seconds, with 4 changes).\n- Drink peppermint tea and apply it as an external compress.\n- Pinch the upper lip between the thumb and index finger, and hold for 20-30 seconds till\nthe cramping disappears.\n- If you are pregnant and cramping occurs, push the toes upward while applying pressure\nto the knee, to flatten the affected part.\n- Here is the strangest advice of all: The next day, repeat the activity that made you sore.\nDo it with much less intensity. This will help work out the soreness. Thereafter, follow\nthis hard/easy routine; for it takes 48 hours for the muscle to properly recover. This is how\nserious athletes train.\n- An alternate method is to vary activities, such as regular walking, with occasional biking\nor swimming instead.\n- After hard exercise or physical work, slow down instead of stopping suddenly. The\nbloodstream is loaded with lactic acid; so slowly exercise at a relaxed pace while it drains\noff. (However, that will not protect you from soreness the next day, resulting from torn\nmuscle fiber.)\n- Perhaps you need to change into more comfortable shoes, in order to improve your leg\nand foot problems.\nONGOING CARE—The blood circulation needs to be improved and equalized.\nDrink enough water each day.\nA common mistake is to drink water and take salt tablets during heated exercise. Instead, you need a full\nrange of electrolytes, and not so much sodium chloride. Drink fruit drinks. At mealtime, eat lots of fresh\nfruits and vegetables. Include seaweed in your diet. Potassium broth (from thick white potato peelings)\nis excellent.\nA fat-free, sugar-free, salt-free diet improves the circulation.\nEat an abundance of green leafy vegetables, in order to improve the quality of the blood and the mineral\nbalance.\nAlfalfa, brewer's yeast, and kelp are important.\nA deficiency of calcium, potassium, selenium, and vitamin E exists.\nMineral imbalances can produce cramping. Be sure you are getting enough calcium through\nsupplementation. Otherwise the phosphorous in certain foods locks with it, so the calcium cannot be\nabsorbed. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for more information on solving the calcium-phosphorous\nproblem.\nThose with dentures, who find eating vegetables difficult, are especially prone to magnesium and\ncalcium deficiency and leg cramps. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw\nvegetable juices daily.\nEvery 3 hours, drink a large glass of quality water, to help clean the bloodstream, liver, kidneys, and\nbowels of stored toxins.\nDrink less whole milk\nEat your meals slowly and chew well.\nDo not smoke. Nicotine greatly impedes blood circulation. Avoid second-hand smoke.\nIf you are taking diuretic drugs, take supplemental potassium. Better yet, switch to corn-silk tea and\nother herbal diuretics; also drink more water (see the several articles on kidneys and urine).\nDo not stand in one position for hours without moving. Some motion or shifting of body weight is vital.\nGet off your feet for 5 minutes every hour. If possible, during that time, take your shoes off; massage\nyour feet and wiggle your toes.\nDo not sit with crossed legs.\nStretch your legs every so often, with the feet flexed up, not down.\nWhen sitting, try to elevate your feet every so often.\nDo not wear garters or any binding clothes.\nAt night, wear roomy pajamas.\nKeep the bed covers loose or use a foot cradle, to keep bedding weight off the feet. If you sleep on your\nstomach, extend your feet over the edge of the bed. Another method is to sleep on your side, with your\nlegs bent and a pillow between your knees.\nRub olive or flaxseed oil into your muscles before and after strenuous exercise.\nTwice a day, soak in a tub of warm water (100o-110o F.). Massage the toes, feet, and calves.\nHere is an exercise which really helps stop ongoing lower leg cramps for many people: Stand with shoes\noff, facing a wall 2-3 feet away. Lean forward, bracing against the wall with hands and arms, all the\nwhile keeping your heels on the floor. When a moderate pull is felt in the calves, hold that position for\n10 seconds.\nThen stand straight for 5 seconds of rest, and lean forward and repeat. Do 3 stretching cycles.\nIf you are overweight, reduce to normal range or slightly below.\nIf leg cramps are caused by varicose veins or pregnancy, elevate the foot of the bed 9 inches.\nIf leg cramping occurs during pregnancy, take frequent rest periods with the feet elevated. Wear\ncomfortable, not tight, clothing. Be sure you are getting enough calcium; this is important.\n—Also see \"Claudication,\" which has the same leg symptoms—but some very special, dangerous\ncauses. It also has additional information on improving the circulation of the legs.\nENCOURAGEMENT—In His service, God will place upon you no restriction that will not increase\nyour happiness. In complying with His requirements, you will find a peace, contentment, and joy you\ncan never have in the path of sin.\nCLAUDICATION (Intermittent Claudication)\nSYMPTOMS—Cramping pain, weakness, and tension in a limb (usually the calves) after muscular\nexercise. Upon resting, the pain always ceases. Typically, after a few moments of rest, the person can\nbegin walking again.\nCAUSES—Intermittent claudication (also simply called claudication) is often a symptom of something\nmore serious: arteriosclerosis of the femoral and popliteal arteries. Other causes include Buerger's\ndisease (which see), or other occlusive arterial diseases of the limbs. Diabetics tend to have claudication\nmore than the average.\nHigh blood pressure (above 160 systolic or 90 diastolic) triples the risk of claudication (see\n\"Hypertension\").\nDiagnosis of claudication is done by a physician, by taking the \"pedal pulse.\" This is the pulse at the\ninstep of each foot. These pulses should be strong and equal, but if one or both is weak or absent, then\nthere is claudication.",

      "overview": "- Take vitamin C, to bowel tolerance; vitamin E and B ; chromium; and selenium.\n6\n- Maintain a total vegetarian diet, free from grease and animal foods. Avoid vegetable oils\nalso. Because of the connection between claudication and blood vessel diseases, the life\nyou save may be your own (see \"Arteriosclerosis\" and related articles on the heart and\nblood vessels).\n- Using nicotine is ruinous to the health in several ways; choking off circulation to the\nlimbs is one of them. Those who smoke are 6 times more likely to develop claudication\n(also see Buerger's Disease).\n- It appears that abnormally high blood viscosity can be a primary cause of poor blood\nflow. The solution is to drink lots of water and use a diet low in fats, sugars, and\nconcentrated foods; that is, those which have a very low moisture content.\n- Stress also reduces blood viscosity, so avoid stress.\n- A regular exercise program is very helpful, especially for those who do it every day. See\n\"Muscle Cramps\" for some sample exercises. Ten repetitions of the exercises should be\ndone at least once a day.\n- In addition to other exercises, take a daily walk. Build up to a total of an hour, each\nmorning and evening.\n- For those who can take them, hot baths are helpful. Always keep the head cool with cool\nwashcloths that are changed frequently.\n- Helpful herbs include ginseng and cayenne.\n—Also see \"Muscle Cramps,\" which, in the legs, have the same symptoms. Also see \"Arteriosclerosis\"\nand related articles.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Come apart and worship God. The everlasting assurance shall be ours that you\nhave a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.\nSIDE STITCHES (Pain in the Side)\nSYMPTOMS—A sharp, temporary, pain in the side.\nCAUSES—This pain is caused by a spasm in the diaphragm, when this muscle between your chest and\nabdomen does not receive enough oxygen.\nRunning is a common immediate cause. The dual pressure from the contracted belly muscles (caused by\nthe raised knee during running) and the expanded lungs from above (caused by deeper breathing) can\nmomentarily shut off blood flow to the diaphragm. This causes it to cramp.\nNot breathing evenly can cause you to get these cramps, even when heavily laughing.\nHowever, the pain can also come from trapped gas in the intestines.\nIf the pain is only on the right side, it may be due to temporary lack of oxygen to the liver.",

He wants to comfort and help you just\nnow.\nFIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME (Chronic Muscle Pain Syndrome,\nFibromyositis, Fibrositis, Tension Myalgia)\nSYMPTOMS—Anxiety, depression, tension, fatigue, chronic muscle aches and pain, joint swelling,\nheadaches (sometimes migraine), irritable bowels, sleep disturbances, and stiffness.\nThe pain is described as burning, throbbing, shooting, and stabbing. Pain and stiffness are greatest in the\nmorning.\nDepression appears to be a key factor. Other symptoms include menstrual problems, palpitations,\nmemory impairment, dizziness, dry eyes and mouth, frequent changes in eyeglasses, and impaired\ncoordination.\nLifting or climbing stairs seems hard to do.\nThe existence of \"tender points\" is a distinctive symptom (see below).\nCAUSES—Fibromyalgia is more of a set of symptoms than a disease, and it is primarily caused by\nstress. Women have it more often than men.\nOften mistaken for arthritis, rheumatism, or Epstein-Barr syndrome, fibromyalgia causes the muscles\nand joints to tighten up when under stress. The emotions have a powerful effect on the body.\nThose experiencing this problem frequently have shallow sleep. Muscle spasms and pain in various\nplaces may occur at night (or during the day).\nThen there are the so-called \"tender points.\" These symptoms are unique to this disease, unlike any other\ndisease. There are 9 pairs of specific points where muscles are especially sensitive to the touch. Here are\nthose 9 locations:\nIn muscles at base of skull, neck, upper back, or mid-back. On the side of the elbow, around the lower\nvertebra of the neck, at the insertion of the second rib, in the upper and outer muscles of the buttocks,\naround the upper part of the thigh bone, at the middle of the knee joint.\nThose with fibromyalgia experience so many sleep problems (apnea, bruxism, restless leg syndrome,\netc.), that they often have chronic fatigue.\nThe symptoms often begin in young adulthood, develop gradually, and slowly increase in intensity until\nmany become incapacitated by the problem.\nSometimes the syndrome disappears; other times it is chronic; and, in some cases, it is comes back in\nrecurring flare-ups.\nThe cause is not really known, but chronic depression of spirits seems to be involved.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (which see) is similar to fibromyalgia, but the former is keyed to chronic\nfatigue and the latter to chronic pain.",

If any of these have been part of your diet, the\nsymptoms may worsen for a time when you drop them, but persevere and you will feel\nbetter for having done so.\n- Do not eat meat, dairy products, white-flour products, processed food, or any food high\nin saturated fats.\n- Avoid wheat and brewer's yeast until your symptoms fade.\n- Poor absorption of food is involved with this problem; so eat slowly of good nourishing\nfood, and chew it well. Be sure to take vitamin/mineral supplementation. Magnesium is\nimportant.\n- Drink plenty of liquids, including quality water.\n- Food and chemical allergies can be involved.

Indeed, count them all, one by one, and thank Him\nfor them all.\n- Determine what your problems are and solve them, know you are working toward\nsolving them, or learn to live with them and no longer be bothered by them.\n- A fair amount of muscular activity helps relax a person mentally and emotionally. Enjoy\nout-of-door activities, such as gardening or raising flowers. You need a regular amount of\nregular daily exercise, not a hard workout every so many days. Building up such a regular\nexercise program will do much to alleviate the problem.\n- Take a hot and cold shower each morning, to stimulate circulation and help reduce\nmorning stiffness. Cold showers are actually better than hot ones for reducing\nfibromyalgia pains.\n- Helpful herbs include comfrey, alfalfa, hop, skullcap, white willow bark, and valerian.\n- Physicians prescribe antidepressants for fibromyalgia.

This is often the best solution, if done by\na properly trained physician.\n- Third, simple remedies may be applied which may, or may not, succeed. If they do not,\nthen an operation can be performed.\nHere are some suggestions:\n- If you are overweight, you need to go on a cleansing program, to lose some of it and\ncleanse the system.\n- Go on a nourishing diet, supplemented by vitamins and minerals and avoiding all grease,\nmeat, and junk foods.\n- Begin a program of exercises each day, to strengthen your muscles (abdominal or leg,\naccording to where the hernia is). For example, push-ups from the knees will strengthen\nthe abdominal muscles.\n- You may wish to try an astringent tea: Make a very strong tea of white oak bark,\nconsisting of one cup of finely broken bark to one quart of water. Boil it 2 minutes and let\nstand 2 hours. Strain, and add 1 tsp. of alum powder. Wet a folded piece of cloth in the tea\nand place it over the hernia. Cover with plastic and hold in place with a truss, elastic\nbandage, or adhesive tape. Using clean cloth, repeat this about 4 times a day for a month.\nThe tannin of the bark and alum will tend to pull together and thicken the area. This may,\nor may not, close the area.\n- You may also try a poultice made of comfrey leaves, bistort root, and giant Solomon's\nseal root. Renew every 12 hours, and keep it on continually for a month.\n- You may instead alternate with the application of poultice at night and the compress\nduring the day, for a month.\n- Shave grass tea compress may also be used.\n—Also see \"Hiatal Hernia\" and \"Umbilical Hernia.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Through all our trials, we have a never-failing Helper.

      "overview": "- According to one view, sprains should be treated with ice or very cold water. Follow this\nby bandaging the injury with an Ace bandage.\n- But, according to a different view, sprains should be initially treated with alternate hot\nand cold—especially if it is in the wrist, elbow, or ankle. This method works better than\nusing cold alone!\n- Put the injured part in very hot water, and keep it there 20-30 minutes. Every few\nminutes take it out of the hot water and plunge it into cold water for about a minutes, then\nback into the hot. Keep the hot water hot. This can continue for up to 2 hours with good\nresults.\n- Repeat this for several days; and, twice a day, massage around the area.\n- If you use the cold method alone on a sprain, you may not be able to walk on a sprained\nankle for days; use the alternate hot and cold method, and you may be much better in half\nthe time.\n- (A third method calls for cold on strains to begin with, to reduce initial swelling,\nfollowed by alternate hot and cold afterward.)\n- If the sprain or strain is in the back or shoulder, treat it with hot fomentations, short cold,\nand massage.\n- A bad bruise on any part of the body can be treated as for a sprain or strain.\n- In addition to the above, strains frequently require a cast similar to that used for a\nfracture, so the injured joint area can be immobilized for more complete rest.\n- DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is a liquid that can be applied externally to the injured area,\nto relieve pain, reduce swelling, and promote healing. But only buy it in the health food\nstore.\n—Also see \"Athletic Workouts.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Those who put away iniquity from their hearts and stretch out their hands in\nearnest supplication unto God will have that help which God alone can give them. In His strength, you\ncan fulfill His will for your life.\n# ATHLETIC WORKOUTS (Strengthening the Muscles)\nPREPARATION—Here are a few helpful suggestions for those engaged in ongoing athletic workouts\nor other heavy labor or activity:\nMaintain a nutritious diet, including full vitamin/mineral supplementation. Eat salads, whole grains,\nseaweed, seeds, nuts, and drink vegetable juices.\nMaintain strong bones (see \"Bones, Strengthening\"). Include silica (horsetail and oat straw herbs), to\nhelp calcium strengthen the bones.\nVitamins A, D, E, C, zinc, and manganese are needed.\nAt the meal before a workout, do not eat much roughage, requiring energy to digest; it will make you\nsluggish. At that meal, avoid peaches, grapes, bananas, and celery.\nLocate your allergies and eliminate them. If you have food allergies, exercise may increase the\nabsorption of the allergenic food, resulting in severe reactions. See \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\"\nGlucose is the main fuel for the muscles. It is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen.\nYou can only work as long as you have stored glycogen ready to be changed into glucose. The best way\nto store up this glycogen is to eat complex carbohydrates.\nAlthough body fat can also be converted to energy, avoid eating much fat. Focus on getting\ncarbohydrates, not fat, in your diet.\nProteins are needed for muscles and tissues; they are not an energy source. The need for protein does not\nincrease during a workout. Excess protein intake (at any time) increases urine elimination, which\nproduces dehydration unless you are drinking enough water. Eating too much protein can damage the\nkidneys.\nStretch and warm up your muscles before exercising. Before doing this, muscles are about 98o F. and\nstiff. After a 5 minutes warm-up, they are several degrees higher and ready for action.\nDrink fluids before, during, and after workouts. To prevent dehydration and cramping, do this whether\nor not you are thirsty.\nBe sure and obtain adequate electrolytes. A 50-50 mix of fruit juice and water will help supply this.\nAfter a workout, keep moving until you are rested. Do not take a shower until your body temperature\nhas cooled down. This cooling down wait will help you avoid cramping and even a heart attack.\nDo not use steroids in order to increase muscle mass and athletic performance! You may see temporary\ngain, but you are injuring your body.\nIn men, Dr. Graham Reedy, M.D, says that long-term use can lead to cancer, sterility, breast\nenlargement, shrinkage of the testicles, and osteoporosis (hollowing of the bones, leading to breakage).\nAfter mentioning some of the diseases steroid usage can lead to, Graham Reedy, M.D., adds: \"Once the\nsteroid treatments are stopped, all the buildup is lost, and fat tends to infiltrate the\ntissue.\" (Complementary Medicine/Sports Review, March/April 1986, p. 33.)\nIn women, excess facial and body hair, breast cancer, shrinkage of the breasts may occur.\nSteroids tend to be psychologically addictive. The person feels dependent on taking them, until the\nphysical damage becomes deeply ingrained. Anabolic steroids can produce heart attacks.\nDo not lift weights if you have a heart problem. At the moment of the lift, breathing stops, circulation to\nthe heart decreases, and great pressure is placed on the heart and lungs by surrounding muscles.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Real happiness is found only in being good and doing good. Live to bless\nothers, and you will find your deepest satisfaction. Live only for yourself, and you will perish alone.\nSection 10\nMuscular-Skeletal\nPart 6\nSpine",

      "overview": "It is easy, over the years, to let your posture collapse. Here are several suggestions to get it back into\nshape:\n- Relax and practice standing up straight. Put your back and head against a wall as you\nlook forward. Hold it for a minute and get a feel for what the ideal is like.\n- Recognize that, as you go through the day, you will not always maintain this ideal. But it\ngives you something to work toward.\n- The best place to practice good posture is when you are walking outside. Try to walk\nerect. Notice that doing so makes it easier to take full breaths of air, and you feel better.\n- Then, when it is time to work, relax, and work, do not worry about keeping a ramrod\nback when you are stooping over, writing, washing the dishes, etc. Real living is not\nramrod; it is a variety of positions.\n- But, when you take your outdoor exercise, return closer to that ideal of perfect posture.\nHere are more ideas:\n- Lie on the floor with your chin down and head straight forward.\n- When you stand, keep both feet flat on the floor. Resting on one leg leads to curvature of\nthe back.\n- Adjust your chair height, so that your thighs are be parallel with the floor and your knees\nare level with, or slightly higher than, your hips. If not, they pull your body forward; your\nback slumps; and you work harder, trying keep your back upright.\n- If you place a small pillow between the small of your back (the lumbar area) and the\nback of the chair, you will tend to sit straighter.\n- As you are sitting, you ought to be able to feel the bones in your buttocks against the\nseat. If you cannot do so, wiggle around until you can. When you cannot feel them, you\nare slumping.\n- When seated at a table and not working, sit 6-8 inches away from it. This will keep you\nfrom slumping over onto it. Only your wrists will be on the edge of the table before you.\nMaintain this same distance if you are working on a computer or typewriter.\nTelevision news announcers use the following two methods, to make a better appearance when they talk\nwhile being seated:\n- (1) Tend to sit on the edge of your chair; you will be less likely to slump back into it.\n- (2) While sitting on the edge of your chair, curl one foot under the chair and stretch the\nother out for balance. This will help keep your back straight.\n- Do not cross your legs. Doing so throws your body out of alignment. Keep your feet flat\non the floor.\n- In a car, pull the seat toward the pedals, until your knees are bent and slightly higher\nthan your hips, and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Either place a small cushion\nbehind the small of your back or use the seat adjustment available in some cars.\n- Get enough sleep at night. You cannot stand or sit straight if you are exhausted.\n- Sleep on a firm mattress. When you lie on your side, both hips and shoulders should sink\nin just a little.\n- When sleeping, either sleep on the side, with a pillow under your head, thick enough to\nkeep your head untilted, or sleep on your back, with only a thin pillow under your head\nand possibly a small pillow under your knees.\n- Walk, run, cycle, or do exercises and stretching, to keep your muscles stretched and in\ngood condition.\n- Here is a way to rest your back and improve your posture at the same time, either during\nbreak or at the end of the day: Lie on the floor for a few minutes with your legs on a low\nchair or stool.\nENCOURAGEMENT—A ransom has been paid for the souls of men, but we must individually\nsurrender our lives to God, so that we may claim that ransom. God has a heaven full of blessings for\nyou.\nBACKACHE (Low Back Pain; Sciatica; Slipped Disk; Lumbar Disk\nHerniation; Spinal Disk Prolapse)\nSYMPTOMS—Pain in the back, frequently in the lower back.\nIf pain comes after lifting something heavy, after coughing, or after unusually heavy exercise, and the\npain prevents you from moving or shoots down one leg, you may have a herniated disk.\nCAUSES—Backache, or pain felt in the spinal column, is one of the most common reasons for\nhospitalization in the Western world. Your spinal column has a complicated interconnection of muscles,\ntendons, bones, and ligaments.\nIt is helpful to identify the various parts of the spine, also called the vertebrae (singular is vertebra): The\ntop part of the spine, where the neck is located, is called the cervical spine (or cervicals); the shoulder\nand mid-part (which protrudes outward in an adult) is called the thoracic; the lower portion (called the\nhollow of the back) is the lumbar; and the bottom part (ending in the tailbone or coccyx) is the sacrum.\nThe first cervical is the atlas. This enables your head to tilt up or down. The second is the axis; it permits\nyour head to turn from side to side.\nAches and pains in the lower back can be a chronic problem. This pain can be in the spine or it can be in\nthe sacroiliac. The sacroiliac joint connects (articulates is the correct word) the spine to the pelvic bone.\n(There can also be pain in the muscles of the lower back; it is called lumbago.)\nA subluxation occurs when two vertebrae get out of proper alignment with one another. A chiropractor\nputs these back in place for relatively little cost.\nSciatica is chronic pain in the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve, which\npasses down through the upper leg, can experience neuralgia and neuritis as a result of a pinched nerve\nin the lumbar region. If the problem is not solved, eventually the leg where the pain is may no longer\nreceive nerve signals from the brain or the central nervous system.\nThe intervertebral disks (also spelled discs) are made of cartilage and act as cushions between the\nvertebrae. Each disk has a tough, fibrous, outer layer surrounding a soft interior, which provides the\ncushioning.\nLumbar disk herniation and lumbar disk prolapse occur when the disk herniates (ruptures or breaks) and\nsome of this soft inner disk material pushes outward against the spinal cord to one degree or another.\nThis may be very serious; and, like sciatica, it can lead to muscle wasting, reduced nerve reflexes, and\nmuscle weakness. Disk herniation and prolapse are often erroneously referred to as a \"slipped disk.\"\nCauses of lower-back pain include wrenched or damaged muscles, bones, tendons, or ligaments, Kidney\nor bladder infection, prostate problems, or female pelvic disorders may cause backache. Overeating,\noverdrinking, eating the wrong kinds of food, and constipation can also be involved. The spinal bones,\nand muscles attached to them, are weakened by wrong habits. Chronic conditions causing back pain\ninclude arthritis, bone disease, or abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis).\nOther causes of back pain are poor posture, walking habits, improper shoes, lifting, straining, calcium\ndeficiency, slouching when sitting, or soft mattresses.\nThere is a definite relationship between smoker's cough and severe back pain. Injecting the nicotine\nequivalent of one cigarette decidedly reduced the measured blood flow in the vertebral body. It is also\nthought that using tobacco interferes with the elasticity of connective tissue.\nA small percentage of lower-back pain may be linked to flat feet.\nSometimes a serious case of constipation will cause an ache in the back, from impacted stools or\npressure from gas.\n(More rarely, back pain can result from congenital abnormalities, metabolic disorders, cancer, or\nreferred syndromes.)\nThe back pain can also be the result of an excess of lactic acid in the muscles, following muscular\nexercise. Drinking enough water helps lessen this problem.\nWhere can you go to get help with your bad back? There are lots of experts out there:\nChiropractors adjust the back by pushing and thrusting. They also recommend nutritional and lifestyle\nchanges. In 1994, the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research issued a report, that\nchiropractors generally provided the most effective treatments for acute back pain. They cost far less, do\nthe job quicker, and do not give medicinal drugs (most of which are usually poisonous). The British\nMedical Journal reported that chiropractic treatments proved more successful than hospital treatments in\nnearly every way.\nX rays are generally considered a routine part of back pain diagnosis; yet only a few back conditions\nshow up on x rays! If the pain is caused by muscle strain or a herniated disk, an x ray will not reveal\nanything because muscles, disks, and ligaments are all soft tissues. Beware of x rays if you are pregnant.\nOrthopedic surgeons are another source of help. These are medical doctors who also do back surgery,\nthey are very likely to recommend it—and that is something you want to avoid, if at all possible.\nOsteopaths can prescribe drugs and do surgery also, but they are less likely to do so.\nPhysiatrists, also called doctors of physical medicine, are also medical doctors. They have a good record\nof helping to solve serious back problems (such as disk problems) without resorting to surgery (which\nthey are not licensed to do). They recommend lifestyle changes, back braces, etc.\nPhysical therapists try to restore muscle strength and joint and spine mobility.\nWhich back pains are the most serious?\nBack pain that comes on suddenly, for no apparent reason.\nBack pain that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, stomach cramps, chest pain, or\ndifficult breathing.\nAn acute attack of back pain that lasts more than 2-3 days, without any relief.\nChronic pain which lasts more than 2 weeks.\nPain in the back which radiates down the leg to the knee or foot.",

      "overview": "First, we will consider less serious back pain:\n- The most common cause of backache is muscle strain. Rest will generally eliminate the\nproblem. Bed rest for 24 hours may be needed.\n- Soaking in a tub of warm water may be quite relaxing to a strained back.\n- For the first 72 hours after a back strain occurs, an 8-minute ice massage often helps.\nUse ice cubes (or freeze water in a paper cup or frozen fruit- juice can). Massage the area\nand about 6-8 inches around it.\n- After 72 hours, use alternate hot and cold applications. Apply a wrung-out hot towel for\n30 seconds, followed by brief cold. Do this 4-5 times.\n- Ice packs are especially helpful in relieving muscles spasms.\n- Moist heat reduces local inflammation and increases blood flow to the area.\n- Some people think that staying in bed for a week will help back pain. This is not true. If\nyou remain in bed a week, it will take two weeks to rehabilitate.\n- Stretching a sore back will tend to accelerate the healing process. Gently bring your\nknees up from the bed and to your chest. Once there, put a little pressure on your knees.\nStretch, then relax. Do this again.\nPreventive measures that will help you, either before or after experiencing back problems:\n- Be very careful when lifting something. Take several deep breaths, to increase muscle\nstrength and then slowly lift with the legs, not the back, and hold the object close to your\nbody. Do not lift from a bending forward position (closing windows, lifting things from\ndeep in the car trunk).\n- Keep the body warm and do not become overly fatigued. When the muscles are chilled\nor you are exhausted, it is easier to injure joints because the muscles are not able to do the\nwork needed.\n- Do not take a hot bath just before doing heavy exercise, for your muscles will be in a\nweaker condition.\n- Proper nutrition, including adequate amounts of calcium, minerals, vitamin D, etc. See\n\"Bones, Strengthening\" for much more on this.\nExercises, to build the muscles are very important, if you would avoid back trouble. More on this later in\nthis article.\n- Walking and rowing are good for the back (walking is good for just about everything!).\n- When sleeping, either a firm mattress should be used or a ¾-inch thick ply board should\nbe placed beneath the top mattress. Place 1-2 pillows under the knees to straighten the\nlumbar curve. When lying on the side, flex the knees and place a pillow between them.\n- Avoid sleeping on the stomach; it increases the swayback and twists the neck. This is\ndue to the fact that the trunk, being heavier, sinks farther into the bed, causing the back to\narch.\n- It is reported that water beds, which do not make a lot of waves, may help people with\nback trouble to sleep.\n- When you get out of bed, roll out slowly and carefully. Do not sit straight up in bed.\n- If you have back pain, slide to the edge of the bed. Then, keeping your back rigid, let\nyour legs off the bed first. That will act as a springboard, lifting your upper body up and\noff the bed.\n- Sit in a straight chair with a firm back. The knees should be higher than the hips; if\nnecessary, use a small footstool. Avoid soft sofas and stuffed chairs. Chair arms help\nsupport the shoulders and upper back. Get up and move about every so often.\n- When in a car, push the car seat forward, to raise the knees higher than the hips. This\nlessens back and shoulder strain. Use safety belts.\n- Look for a car with adjustable lumbar support, and adjust the support down as low as it\ngoes. Then, if necessary, raise it a notch or two.\n- Do not stand in one position for long periods.\n- High-heeled shoes will bring trouble sooner or later. Women should wear low-heeled\nshoes if they want to protect their pelvic organs and spine.\n- Good posture when sitting, standing, or walking should be the goal.\nExercises to strengthen the back:\n- Do press-ups which are half a push-up. Lie on the floor, on your stomach. Keep your\npelvis flat on the floor and push up with your hands, arching your back as you lift your\nshoulders off the floor. This will help strengthen your lower back.\n- Do floor swimming. Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise your left arm and right leg.\nHold for one second, then alternate with the right arm and left leg. Go back and forth. This\nextends and strengthens the lower back.\n- Do a crunch sit-up. Lay on your back on the floor, with knees flexed and feet flat on the\nfloor. Cross your arms with your hands on your shoulders. Raise your head and shoulders\noff the floor as high as you can while keeping your lower back on the floor. Hold for one\nsecond, then repeat.\n- Know your limit when exercising. If you feel fine 1-2 days after exercising, then it is\nsafe to continue them.\n- Spinal surgery: Should you have a back operation? Sometimes the problem is so serious\nthat a back operation is necessary. But, if at all possible, try to avoid having one. Not only\nare they expensive, but frequently do not solve your movement and pain problems. It is an\nintriguing fact that, according to U.S. government reports, only 1% of those with back\npain obtains relief from back surgery. And there is always the possibility that the\noperation will only result in greater pain, more serious damage, and even less mobility.\nBut, after weighing all the possibilities, you may still decide to undergo it.\n—Also see \"Sciatica.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Those who come frequently to the throne of grace, offering up sincere,\nearnest, prayers for God's help will not fail of fulfilling His plan for their lives.\nSCOLIOSIS—1 (Curvature of the Spine)\nSYMPTOMS—The spine is curved slightly to one side.\nCAUSES—Scoliosis occurs 80% of the time in girls, and primarily in preteen and teen years, during\nrapid growth spurts.\nDiagnosis is made by having the person bend over away from you. Look for lateral deviation (a leaning\nto the left or right).\nThe primary cause is that one set of the spinal muscles (right side or left side) is stronger than the other.\nThis causes an \"S\" curve in the spine.\nThese changes are the result of degeneration of muscles on one side; and, in some instances, they may\nbe the early stage of muscular dystrophy.",

If suppuration (pussing) occurs, surgical\ninterference is generally indicated.\nCAUTIONS—Avoid Cold Baths; instead use partial cold applications, such as the Cold Mitten Friction\nand the Cold Towel Rub.\n—Also see \"Peritonitis—1.\"\nPELVIC CONGESTION (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC APPLICATIONS—Graduated cold applications; hot vaginal irrigation, 10-15 minutes, twice\ndaily; Hot Blanket Pack to legs with cold pelvic pack (Wet Sheet Pack over pelvic area), continued to\nsweating stage, followed by cold friction or Wet Sheet Rub.\nPAIN—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath at 950-970 F., for 15-20 minutes.\nLEUKORRHEA—In addition to the above measures, antiseptic vaginal irrigation. In certain cases,\ncool irrigation, at 750-650 F., produces better results than hot irrigation. Constipation and portal\ncongestion must be relieved. Cervical catarrh and erosions often require the use of the curette [a spoonshaped scraping instrument for scraping foreign matter from a cavity].\nACUTE INFLAMMATION—If attacks of inflammation occur, rest in bed; Hot Hip or Leg Pack; hot\nand cold pelvic compress or hot and cold pelvic pack.\nPELVIC PAIN (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC FACTORS—Remove all known causes: tight bands around the waist, tight shoes, cold\nextremities, sexual excess.\nGENERAL APPLICATIONS—Rest in a horizontal position, with proper general treatment for any\nexisting general or local morbid condition, as anemia, neurasthenia, hysteria, enteroptosis, constipation,\nor any discoverable pelvic disease. If caused by neuralgia: Give hot Hip and Leg Pack or very hot\nRevulsive Sitz, 3 times a day; hot water bottle over seat of pain and heat to feet and legs. Very hot\nvaginal irrigation.\nIf due to chronic congestion in a pelvic organ: Hot Hip and Leg Pack every 2-4 hours, with abdominal\nHeating Compress and heating leg packs during the interval between.\nIf due to inflammation or acute congestion: Hot Hip and Leg Pack or Hot and Cold Pelvic Pack every 24 hours, followed by continuous heat to legs with cooling compress to lower abdomen, external genitals\nand inner surfaces of thighs. Vaginal irrigation at 1050 F. for 15 minutes, every 3 hours. Apply Ice Bag\nover seat of pain during the hot vaginal irrigation and Hot Hip and Leg Pack.\nSection 11\nEndocrine\nPart 1\nAdrenals\nHYPOGLYCEMIA (Low Blood Sugar)\nSYMPTOMS—Confusion, depression, nervousness, anxiety, antisocial behavior, emotional instability,\nexhaustion, headaches, impatience, inability to cope, fears, craving for sugar, faintness, dizziness.\nSymptoms especially occur a few hours after eating sweets or fats. The more that is eaten and the longer\nthe span before the symptoms occur, the worse they are.\nCAUSES—The problem is adrenal exhaustion. The cause is too much stress, worry, and an excess of\nundigested sugars, starches, proteins, and dairy products. The cortin hormone is depleted, so food cannot\nbe digested properly.\nPeople consume large quantities of sugars, caffeine, soft drinks, and alcohol. These all contain simple\nsugars, and insufficient amounts of complex carbohydrates. Add to this: high stress levels, and the two\nadrenal glands become exhausted.\nHypoglycemia can be inherited, but more often it is brought on by an inadequate diet (and is then called\nfunctional hypoglycemia). However, there are several other physical problems which can weaken\nadrenal function and help bring on hypoglycemia. These include weaknesses in the thyroid, liver,\nkidneys, pituitary, and pancreas. Immune deficiency and candidiasis can also lead to it. Other causes\ninclude smoking and large amounts of caffeine.\nHypoglycemia is sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as asthma, allergies, fatigue syndrome, stomach,\nintestinal, weight problems, or mental or nervous disorders.\nHalf the people, over 50, who have hypoglycemia, are hypothyroid.",

      "overview": "- Refined starches, sugars, and a high-meat diet wear out the adrenals. Too much sugar\nshocks the adrenal cortex, and the resulting physical reaction is to crave still more sugar.\n- Stop eating or using meat, nicotine, alcohol, chocolate, soft drinks, black tea, and\nsugared and fat foods. Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco produce wide swings in blood sugar\nlevels.\n- Read the labels at the grocery store, and avoid dextrose, dextrin, lactose, maltose,\nsucrose, fructose, modified food starch, corn syrup, corn sweetener, cornstarch, and\nnatural sweetener. Only use honey and molasses in small amounts. Also stay away from\nsorbitol, hexanol, mannitol, and glycol.\n- Too much salt also exhausts the adrenals and causes a loss of potassium, leading to\nlower blood sugar.\n- Eat natural foods, the ones you should have been eating to begin with. Whole grains, raw\nand simply cooked vegetables, some fresh fruit. But eat in moderation starchy foods, such\nas corn, noodles, pasta, white rice, hominy, and yams.\n- Eat a high-fiber diet and vegetables that are raw or steamed. These are good for you:\nbeans, lentils, brown rice, white potatoes, soy products, and fruits.\n- Useful fruits include apricots, apples, bananas, grapefruit, lemons, cantaloupes, and\npersimmons. For example, eat a raw apple instead of applesauce, for the apple has more\nfiber which will help keep blood sugar stabilized.\n- Licorice acts like cortin and helps the blood sugar. Bilberry and wild yam help control\ninsulin levels. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Spirulina tablets, taken between meals,\nhelp stabilize blood sugar.\n- During a blood sugar reaction, eat something that has both fiber and protein, such as rice\nor bran crackers with almond butter. Fiber alone (popcorn, rice, oat bran, crackers, ground\nflaxseed, and psyllium husks) has the ability to slow down a hypoglycemic reaction. A\nhalf hour before each meal, eat some of this high fiber, to stabilize blood sugar.\n- Once a month, go on a fresh vegetable juice fast for a day. Take enemas with some\nadded lemon juice at that time. If a reaction starts to occur, reach for the fiber, protein\npowder, or spirulina.\n- Avoid stressful situations. You may have a milk allergy, which often accompanies this\ndisease.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus cares for each individual as though there were not another person on the\nearth. He will help you also, as you seek Him earnestly with all your heart.\nADDISON'S DISEASE (Adrenal Underactivity)\nSYMPTOMS—Dizziness, fainting, nausea, loss of appetite, moodiness, decrease in body hair, inability\nto cope with stress. Slight darkening and discoloration of the skin is more noticeable when body parts\nare exposed to the sun. This would include forehead, knees, elbows, scars, skin folds and creases (on the\npalms, etc.). The mouth and freckles may appear darker. The hair becomes darker.\nBands of pigment run the length of the nails.\nReduced adrenal function (resulting either from Addison's or Cushing's Disease) can result in weakness,\nheadaches, memory problems, dizziness, allergies, food cravings, and blood sugar disorders.\nCAUSES—Both the adrenal underactivity of Addison's Disease and the overactivity of Cushing's\nDisease are caused by problems in the function of the adrenal glands.\nContinued use of cortisone drugs for arthritis and asthma, etc., damage the adrenals. Those drugs cause\nthem to shrink in size and not work properly. Yet, surprisingly enough, the shrunken glands can still\noverproduce and cause Cushing's Disease or underproduce and cause Addison's.\nThere is a way you can pinpoint whether or not your adrenals are functioning normally:\nThe systolic is the first number in a blood pressure reading, and the diastolic is the second. For example,\n120/80. The systolic should be 10 points higher when you are standing than when you are lying down.\nLie down and rest for 5 minutes, and then have someone take your blood pressure. Then stand up and\nhave it immediately taken again. The blood pressure will probably be somewhat higher.\nBut if it is lower when standing than when laying flat, the adrenals are not working properly. The lower\nit is, the worse the condition of the adrenals.\nYou will want to contact a medical professional. Addison's is a chronic condition which needs to be\ncontinually worked with. You may moderate the problem, but it is never fully eliminated.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—The symptoms are first seen in very small children. Large amounts of thick mucous\ndevelops in the lungs, blocking lung passages and causing difficult breathing, chronic coughing and\nwheezing, and lung infections.\nThere are digestive problems, inadequate absorption of fats, after-meal stomach pain, and thinness. Body\nsweat will have very large amounts of sodium, potassium, and chloride salts. Any, or all, of these\nsymptoms may occur.\nCAUSES—In 1938, this physical problem was named \"cystic fibrosis\" because it was mistakenly\nthought that abnormal changes in the pancreas were true cysts (tiny pockets of fluid lined with normal\ntissue). But it was later discovered that those spots were just part of the shrinking process of the\npancreas, as the disease worsened.\nThere are three views of the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF):\n1 - CF is an inherited disease, which the sufferer must learn to live with.\n2 - CF is caused by inadequate absorption of selenium, zinc, essential fatty acids, and other minerals\n(including trace minerals) as a result of subclinical celiac disease. (Celiac disease is the inability to\ndigest wheat and some other foods.)\n3 - Dr. Joel Wallach, a veterinarian, who in 1978 was the first to diagnose CF in a laboratory animal, by\nnoting characteristic CF changes in the pancreas and liver of baby monkeys, says he was fired when it\nwas discovered that he could reproduce those CF changes in the body by giving or withholding the\nelement, selenium. He had shown that CF was a nutritional problem which could be solved if caught\nearly enough. (See Let's Play Doctor, J.D. Wallach, D.V.M., N.D., pp. 109-110. See order sheet.)\n\"The prevention of CF has been accomplished in pet, farm and laboratory animals by the veterinary\nprofession by assuring adequate levels of selenium and essential fatty acid nutrition to the pregnant and\nnursing mother. This is not as easy as it sounds because of malabsorption problems (i.e., celiac disease\nand Crohn's disease) in a percentage of women. All things being normal, a supplementation of 200 mcg\nselenium per day and 5 gm of flaxseed oil, three times a day [to the pregnant and nursing mother], would\nbe adequate to prevent CF.\n\"Treatment of CF is very basic: treat the infant as early as possible with selenium IM [given\nintramuscularly] at 10-25 mcg per day.\"—Op cit., p. 109.\nHe adds that it is vital that it be determined if the infant is allergic to wheat, cow's milk or soy milk, so\nas to avoid what he is allergic to.\nWe might conclude that all three theories are correct; in that, if you give the mother and infant proper\nsupplementation, the disease can be eliminated at the beginning of the child's life.\nBut if this is not done, he will thereafter not be able to absorb nutrients properly, will exhibit the\nsymptoms of CF, and will have to cope with the problem the rest of his life.\nHowever, Wallach says that, even later, the person can lead a more normal life if he regularly receives\nessential fatty acids, intravenously, and selenium, intramuscularly.\n\"The lungs of CF patients are normal at birth and only develop bronchiectasis after chronic essential\nfatty acid and copper deficiencies have taken their toll.\"—Ibid.\n\"CF . . is preventable, 100% curable in the early stages, and can be far better managed in chronic cases\nthan it is currently managed by `orthodox' medicine.\"—Op. cit., p. 108.",

We can only\ntouch on the subject here.\nOf the two types of diabetes, diabetes insipidus is the more rare and is caused by an inadequately\nfunctioning pituitary hormone (vasopressin) or kidneys which somehow cannot respond properly to it.\nDiabetes mellitus is the third largest killer in the U.S., and is caused by a defect in the production of\ninsulin by the pancreas. Without insulin, the body cannot utilize glucose, which is an important blood\nsugar. A blood glucose level above 180 mg. percent causes excess sugar to spillover into the urine and\nmake it sweet. (Mellitus means \"sweet.\") Diabetes comes from a Greek word for \"flow through,\" since\ndiabetics produce so much urine.\nSome people can develop diabetes mellitus as a result of stress, obesity, or pregnancy. Certain medicinal\ndrugs can also cause it: oral contraceptives, adrenal corticosteroids, phenytoin, or thiazide diuretics. A\ndiet high in sugar and white flour can lead to diabetes. Parasites (especially in children) can also do it.\nHypothyroidism can also cause it.\nIt is of interest that people who eat much sugar eventually cannot taste it as well; so they pour on more\nsugar! But Type II diabetes sufferers also lack this sugar-tasting discernment. Leave off the sugar, and\nlearn to enjoy the natural flavors in your food.\nBecause the diabetic cannot utilize glucose for energy, he loses weight and is weakened by excess\nconsumption of his protein and fat stores. Because of this, he may be very hungry and eat large amounts\nof food.",

Totally avoid tobacco and those who use it.\nBecause it restricts circulation, it will aggravate your condition.\n- Eat smaller meals (if necessary, eat them more frequently), and chew the food\nthoroughly. Do not eat late in the evening. Overeating can induce diabetes or increase it,\nonce contracted.\n- Vegetable broths and fresh fruit are nourishing. A high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet will\nreduce the need for insulin. (A low-fiber diet can bring on diabetes.) It will also lower the\namount of fat in the blood. Get your protein from vegetable sources.\n- Onions and green beans appear to lower blood sugar. A diet high in raw food is also\nhelpful. One individual dropped his insulin dosage from 60 to 15 units per day, by\nincreasing his raw food intake.\n- But do not eat fruits and melons in large amounts. Do not eat apples or bananas. Do not\neat milk and sugar combinations. Coffee can induce very high blood sugar levels. A fatfree diet will help reduce blood sugar.\n- Eat your meals at regular times, and do not be in a rush to swallow the food. The quicker\nyou eat, the higher goes the blood sugar.\n- Eat raw garlic every day, to reduce your blood sugar.\n- Do not take large amounts of niacin (vitamin B ), B (thiamin), PABA (para3 1\naminobenzoic acid, another B vitamin), or vitamin C. But do take them in normal\namounts.\n- Get enough exercise; it will improve circulation, which is always poor in diabetics. This\nwill also lower blood sugar levels.\n- Huckleberry helps promote insulin production. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Other\nhelpful herbs include black walnut, echinacea, burdock, buchu, dandelion root, and uva\nursi.\n- In case of a hyperglycemia attack, go to an emergency room. You must be given fluids,\nelectrolytes, and possibly insulin.\n- In case hypoglycemia occurs, in an emergency, immediately drink fruit juice, soft drinks,\nor anything else that contains sugar. If you are insulin dependent, carry a glucagon kit\nwith you at all times.\n- If your child has diabetes, tell his teacher the warning signs of hypoglycemia and\nhyperglycemia.\n- Take good care of your feet, for they can become more easily infected than those of nondiabetics.\n—Also see \"Diabetes—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The love of God toward the fallen race is unfathomable.

It tells the rest of the body when to produce more\nheat or less. Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck),\nand affects several body functions, including the general rate of metabolism. The pituitary, located in the\ncenter of the skull, sends out TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), to tell the thyroid to speed up or slow\ndown. When a weak thyroid does not respond, TSH levels remain high—and you have hypothyroidism.\nThe hormone, thyroxine, is almost pure iodine.\nFirst thing in the morning, place a thermometer under your arm for 15 minutes while keeping still. A\ntemperature of 97.6o F. or lower may indicate an underactive thyroid. Write down the result for five\ndays. (Others say that if the test is consistently below 98, you are low thyroid.)\nA low thyroid condition generally does not produce goiter (which see). If you had goiter, your thyroid\ngland would enlarge.\nIt is thought that Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. This occurs\nwhen the body becomes allergic to its own thyroxine! It is not clear why this happens.\nIn addition, the immune system can produce antibodies that invade and attack the thyroid, disrupting\nhormone production. This destruction of the thyroid, resulting in hypothyroidism, is called myxedema. It\nis actually a disease of the immune system. It is believed that an excess of chemicals, poisonous fumes,\nmedicinal drugs, tobacco smoke, impure living, etc., disrupts the immune system and starts it on such\nrampages.\nGet away from the chemicals by moving to the country, live a clean life, eat right, use a distiller to make\nyour own water, work out-of-doors part of the time, have peace with God, and you will feel better every\nday.\nMedical treatment includes the taking of thyroxine from animals, or synthroid. This is generally 3-9\ngrains each morning. An excess will cause increase in heart rate and shaking of the extended arm.\nThe active ingredient in synthroid and other synthetic thyroid medications, is levothyroxine. It can cause\na loss of as much as 13 percent of bone mass. An estimated 19 million people in the U.S. take this drug\nfor thyroid problems or thyroid cancer.\nThyroid supplementation can cause cardiac arrest in those whose hearts are not strong enough for the\nincreased activity the thyroid dosage places upon it.\nThyroid medication can have a similar effect on the adrenals. They may be working poorly, as a result of\nyears of low thyroxine. The medication can cause adrenal insufficiency. Diabetes can be made worse by\nthe thyroid pill. Anticoagulants can be upset.\nIn newborn infants, synostosis can occur if they are given thyroid. The skull bones close prematurely\nand the brain does not develop properly.\nThyroid supplementation also increases the need for insulin and, in some, for antidepressants as they\nbecome extremely agitated.\nThyroid medication can produce arrhythmia, angina, and tachycardia, or hair loss.\nAfter menopause, a smaller dose of thyroid medication is often needed by women.\nThe human body needs less thyroid as it gets older, so older folk should try reducing their dose of\nsynthroid. To do this, try reducing the amount you take by one dose a week (example: 5 doses a week,\nthen 4 doses the next week, etc.). When you encounter problems, stay with that amount for 4 weeks to\nsee if the thyroid will adjust itself to this new amount. After a month, try reducing the dosage again, but\nstaying one month at each reduced level.",

      "overview": "- You need iodine every day, at every meal. But how do you obtain it? Long use of\nthyroid medication can weaken the bones or result in breast cancer.\n- Among the seaweeds, Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp are the best balanced\nsources of trace minerals. Most other seaweed products also contain iodine, but they are\nnot always as balanced in providing a wide spectrum of other trace minerals. California\nkelp is not as good.\n- Here is an address for Nova Scotia dulse: Harry Greene, North Head, Grand Manan, N.\nB. [New Brunswick], Canada. My last boxful was $12 for 12 ounces. I let it dry, then\nwhiz the leaves, put them in jars, and sprinkle it on my food.\n- Some nature therapists recommend coating the bottom of your feet with iodine, in order\nto increase iodine absorption by your body. Others do not recommend it. You really have\nno certainty as to what substances and quantities you are taking into your body.\n- Another source of iodine is Lugol's solution. This, of course, should be taken in\nextremely small doses. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain. Pharmacies have it, but will\nnot dispense it without a prescription.\n- Of course, there is also iodized salt. The problem here is that aluminum is in storebought salt (so it will not cake), and that can lead to Alzheimer's disease (which see).\n- Some turn to \"sea salt,\" but generally this is nothing more than regular salt, extracted\nfrom the ocean rather than from salt mines. It is just regular salt!\n- Some use rock salt (from salt mines), and grind it up. But this lacks the iodine.\n- There is a firm in France which produces salt from the ocean which does have all the\nnatural trace minerals, including iodine: The U.S. address is Grain & Salt Society, P.O.\nBox DD, Magalia, CA 95954 / 916-872-5800. Of the three products (Light Grey, Fine\nGround, and Flower of the Ocean), the Fine Ground seems to strike a balance between\nfine grain and low price. The salt is slightly moist, but this is natural. Dry, free-flowing,\nsalt has always been treated with chemicals.\n- I recommend that you use both Nova Scotia dulse and this French sea salt at every meal.\n- For some, thyroid problems can be corrected, but for others it is something to live with,\nfor a lifetime, while doing that which may lessen the problem. In addition to taking added\niodine, eat a nutritious diet. The experts say to only eat in moderation the cabbage family\n(broccoli, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, mustard greens), for they tend to suppress the\nthyroid function. The same is said to hold true for peaches and pears.\n- Chlorine, fluoride, and iodine are chemically related, and block entrance of iodine into\nthe thyroid. So avoid chlorinated water, fluoridated water, and toothpaste.\n- A thyroid deficiency can result from lack of sunshine and free fats (margarine, butter,\nmayonnaise, fried foods, cooking fats, salad oils, and peanut butter).\n- Functions of the thyroid will be increased by more exercise, for it stimulates TSH\nproduction by the pituitary. T3 increases slowly in the blood during, and after, vigorous\nexercise.\n- Mother's milk is a good treatment for hypothyroid babies, and it helps protect normal\nbabies from developing the problem until weaning.\n- Vitamin A is necessary for iodine to be properly absorbed; the B vitamins work together,\nto nourish the thyroid; B helps the thyroid use its iodine effectively in hormone\n6\nproduction; B helps the thyroid work properly.\n12\n- To stimulate the thyroid: Eat one serving each of oats and bananas daily, take a cool\nshower each morning and night, and work 3-5 hours out-of-doors every day.\n- Avoid electric blankets if you can.\n- Use a salt-free, oil-free, sugar-free diet until the thyroid is under control. But, on the long\nterm, you need a little salt and oil.\n- In cretins, who are born hypothyroid, try taking them off the thyroid medication after\nthree years of supplementation. Maybe their thyroid will start functioning on its own.\n- A nature healer in Central America recommends the following procedures:\n- To go off thyroid supplementation: Go on a fasting, cleansing program of fruit and\nvegetable juices, followed by a building program of eating simple nourishing foods\n(especially raw food). Do this for 2-4 weeks. Get back and neck spinal adjustments, and\ntake one kelp tablet daily. He says this always works.\nGOITER—He also recommends this:\nTo eliminate goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland): Follow the above program; and then, after the 2-4\nweeks, do one or more of the following four neck applications: (1) Put an Epsom salt compress on the\nneck every night, and leave it on all night for 10 nights. (2) Use a compress of white oak bark tea over\nthe goiter for better results. (3) Put two hot fomentations around the neck, for 4 minutes each and one\ncold compress for 4 minutes. Continue alternating this for an hour. Then spend 5-10 minutes doing\nexercises with the neck in various positions. (4) Put a poultice of ground-up almonds completely around\nthe neck and leave it on all night, for 3-10 nights. This is especially good for harder, more fibrous,\ngoiters.\nNitrates are goitrogenic; that is, they stimulate goiter formation. Nitrates can be found in hot dogs,\nsausages, luncheon meats, and variously prepared meat products. Nitrates are also found in well water,\nfrom fertilizer runoff.\nInterestingly enough, many people with Parkinson's disease (which see) tend to have hypothyroidism.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The secret of happiness is to live a life wholly dedicated to God. You are the\nLord's, for He created you. Give Him your heart and your plans, obey His Written Word, and He will\nwonderfully guide your life.\nHYPERTHYROIDISM (Overactive Thyroid)\nSYMPTOMS—Fatigue; insomnia; intolerance; irritability; increased perspiration; constantly feeling\nhot; frequent bowel movements; hair and weight loss; nails separate from nail bed; change in skin\nthickness; hand tremors; intolerance of heat; rapid heartbeat; goiter; and, sometimes, protruding\neyeballs. In women, there may also be less frequent menstruation and decreased flow.\nCAUSES—Hypothyroidism is caused by an underactive thyroid, and results in a slow metabolism and\nall it brings with it. Hyperthyroidism is the opposite: The thyroid is overactive; metabolism is too fast,\nand that brings its own problems. The thyroid gland is producing too much thyroxine.\nSometimes called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is not a simple problem to deal with. Graves' disease\nis the most common form of it, which 2.5 million Americans have.\nA detailed discussion of the thyroid is found in our article on Hypothyroidism (which see), which is far\nmore common. Both affect women more often than men. When the thyroid does not work properly, a\nvariety of different physical problems can develop.\nIn fact, the word, \"hypochondriac,\" was coined many years ago, to describe these strange people who\nhave all kinds of things wrong with them, when they do not seem to have anything wrong with them.\nSurely, it must all be in their heads! Well, it was in their throats. We now know those people had under\nor overactive thyroids.\nInfection of the thyroid or certain prescription drugs can temporarily produce hyperthyroidism.",

Whatever the\ntrials that life may bring, in Christ's strength, we are able to meet them.\nLYMPHANGITIS (Spleenic Inflammation)\nSYMPTOMS—Begins with a chill and high fever, with moderate swelling and pain of the lymphatic\ntissues. A severe pain develops in the left side, and extends up to the shoulder. When the infection is in\nthe deep layers of skin, there is a deep general flush with raised borders in the affected areas. The skin\nbecomes hot and dry, and the person becomes very thirsty.\nCAUSE AND TREATMENT—This is a streptococcus infection of one or more lymphatic glands,\nusually of the spleen. Applications of heat should be made, in the form of baths or hot fomentations.\nGive plenty of fluids, to help flush out the lymphatics.\nRest and a light diet are important.

It most frequently occurs in young adults. There are hundreds of lymph nodes in your body and,\ntogether with their connecting network of tubes, are really immense in size and scope.\nThe lymphatic system helps protect the body against toxins of various types.

If caused by PMS, the tenderness may occur regularly every month; if associated with early\npregnancy, missed periods and a positive home pregnancy test will reveal that.\nThe cause is generally the natural cycles of your reproductive hormones, which are estrogen and\nprogesterone. They signal the milk-producing glands in the breast to grow and areas around them to\nexpand with blood and other fluids to nourish the cells. This can result in stretched nerve fibers and a\nsense of pain.\nThen there are fibrocystic changes, which include lumps and cysts (see \"Breast Cyst\" for more\ninformation).",

This is most frequent in women of child-bearing age, and primarily occurs between the ages of 30 and\n50.\nWhen there is too much fluid in the breast, instead of moving it out of the breast, the lymph system\nstores it in small spaces, here and there. Eventually, fibrous tissue surrounds them and thickens, forming\ncysts. These cysts frequently swell just before the monthly, causing pain.\nThese cysts may change in size; but, although tender, they move freely. In contrast, a cancerous growth\ngenerally does not move freely, is usually not tender, and does not leave.\nIt is important to regularly examine each breast for lumps, and determine what kind they are. It is best to\ndo this weekly.\nIt is known that the risk of breast cancer is three times as great in women with cysts.\nBreast cysts rarely appear after the age of 50, when estrogen levels are less.\nHormonal imbalance, abnormal production of breast milk (caused by high levels of estrogen), and an\nunderactive thyroid can induce cysts.\nOther causative agents are listed below.",

Do not eat nuts which have been heated.\n- The trace element, germanium, is important. It is found in garlic and onions.\n- Research shows that milk and dairy products have high estrogen levels. It is best to avoid\nthem, for the cyst problem can always lead to a cancerous condition.\n- Avoid a diet high in meat, eggs, butter, and cheese.\n- White-flour products should be avoided.\n- Do not eat chocolate, animal products, cooked oils, fried foods, sugar, salt or drink\nbeverages with alcohol or caffeine.\n- Do not use nicotine products. They stimulate the growth of cysts.\n- Not using caffeine and applying primrose oil will help reduce the cysts.\n- Methylxanthines (which include caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine), found in\ncaffeine and chocolate foods have, been found to induce breast disease.\n- Keep the weight low. It is more difficult to locate tumors in larger breasts.\n- If you have an underactive thyroid, do what is needed to strengthen it, since\nhypothyroidism (which see) has been linked to fibrocystic disease.\n- Breast congestion can be caused by padded bras. Do not overheat the breasts; this can\nlead to breast cancer.\n- Excess clothing on the trunk, and not enough on the extremities, is a significant cause of\nfemale problems of various types.\n- Drink enough water, so it is easier for the blood and lymphatic system to care for the\nmilk glands.\nHere is additional advice, to help you avoid problems with benign breast changes:\n- Regularly take B vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium. These vitamins help\nregulate the production of prostaglandin E, which in turn slows down prolactin activity.\nProlactin activates breast tissue.\n- Do not use diuretic drugs. Instead, drink more water to help improve kidney function.\n- Do not use highly salted foods.\n- Some find that applying cold water to the breasts helps when they are painful. But others\nfind that alternating very warm and cold works better. This can be done via heating pads,\ncold cloths, showers, etc.\n- Gentle breast massage will help move liquids out of the breast area into the lymph\npassages.\n- Dong quai helps regulate hormonal levels. Goldenseal helps heal infections. Red clover\ncleans the blood. Chlorophyll helps clean the liver and prevent formation of cysts.\nGermanium and CoQ10 provide oxygen to the cells and prevent free radical damage.\nFlaxseed oil helps prevent breast cancer.\n—Also see \"Cancer.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—When you open your eyes in the morning, thank God that He has kept you\nthrough the night.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—There are over 150 symptoms linked to PMS, of which the most common include\nabdominal bloating, anxiety, acne, backache, breast swelling and tenderness, swollen feet, depression,\ncramps, food cravings, fainting spells, headaches, fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, nervousness, impatience,\ndrastic mood swings, angry outbursts.\nOther symptoms include sluggishness, lethargy, delusions, indecisiveness, dizziness, constipation,\nhemorrhoids, skin eruptions, and migraines.\nCAUSES—PMS affects many women during the one to two weeks prior to the onset of menstruation. It\naffects one-third to one-half of all American women between the ages of 20 and 50. As many as 75%\nhave the problem at one time or another. About 5% are incapacitated by it, and about a third report\nsymptoms severe enough to interfere with their daily life.\nBearing children or being married seems to increase the likelihood. The problem is a major cause of\ndivorce.\nHormonal imbalance is part of the PMS problem (see \"Menstrual Disorders\").\nThe liver regulates hormonal balance, by selectively filtering out of the blood and excreting unwanted\nexcess hormones. One of these is estradiol, a type of estrogen which causes problems. If not eliminated,\nit can build up in the body.\nPart of the hormonal imbalance problem is that there is too much estrogen in the body and not enough\nprogesterone. Fluid retention is the result. This affects the circulation and impedes oxygen and nutrient\nflow to the brain and female organs.\nAdditional causative factors are mentioned below.",

      "overview": "- Constipation is a primary reason why the liver cannot get rid of excess estradiol. Eat\nnatural foods with sufficient bulk. Avoid processed and junk foods.\n- Meals high in complex carbohydrates help one deal with stress. It is thought that they\nincrease the production of serotonin, a brain chemical which counteracts depression.\n- An inadequate supply of B complex vitamins is another factor causing PMS. B vitamins\nand magnesium help the liver excrete unwanted estrogen. Fried foods block the absorption\nof magnesium.\n- Eating chocolate, caffeine, sugar, and excess sodium are additional causative factors.\nWomen who regularly consume caffeine are four times more likely to have severe PMS.\n- Red meat and dairy products help produce a hormonal imbalance—exactly the kind in\nPMS, excessive estrogen and inadequate progesterone.\n- Another factor is unstable blood sugar levels. This can be caused by hypoglycemia or\nsimply poor eating habits. Either way, eat complex carbohydrates and avoid the sugar\nfoods.\n- Food allergies are another related factor. Search out the offending foods and stop eating\nthem (see \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test\").\n- It is important that you not eat foods which contain hormones! Many have been added to\ndairy products (via cows and chickens) and meat.\n- Obtain a full supply of vitamin/mineral supplements.\n- Adequate calcium intake during the monthly cycle is very important. Blood calcium\ndrops 10 days before menstruation. A lack of it causes headaches, tension, nervousness,\ndepression, insomnia.\n- Magnesium and vitamin D help in calcium absorption. Adequate stomach acid is also\nneeded.\n- Do not use caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.\n- Fast for 1-3 days on fruit and vegetable juices before the period onset, to reduce\nproblems.\n- Regular outdoor exercise is important. Walk at least half a mile a day. This increases\noxygen intake, which in turn aids in nutrient absorption and elimination of toxins.\n- Here are herbs which may help reduce the pain of cramps: rosemary, black haw, cramp\nbark, red raspberry, kava kava, and angelica.\n- Selenium is an antioxidant and helps prevent menstrual cramps.\n- Use warm sitz baths, heating pad, or hot water bottle for cramps. This draws the healing\nblood and relaxes muscles.\n- Herbs helpful in treating PMS include dong quai, false unicorn root, fennel seed, squaw\nvine, blessed thistle, and sarsaparilla root. They help balance the hormones.\n- Some women with PMS are deficient in melatonin.\n- Wild yam cream contains a natural form of the hormone, progesterone, and helps many\nwomen. Rub the cream into the skin on the chest, inner arms, thighs, and abdomen just\nafter ovulation. The active ingredient is absorbed through the skin.\n- Vitamin E has been found useful in the treatment of PMS, with most improvement\nwhere benign breast disease was a major problem. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and helps\nprevent inflammatory reactions to dietary fats. It is possible that Vitamin A and zinc also\naids in this function.\n- Vitamin B (50-150 mg daily, especially during the 10 days preceding menstruation,\n6\nhelps relieve premenstrual edema, swellings, and soreness.\n- Discuss the problem with your spouse. This will help him understand the situation.\n—Also see \"Menstrual Disorders\" and \"Breast Discomfort.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The angels of God guard us every moment. Have we not reason to be thankful\nfor the protection we are given? All through the day, thank God for His blessings.\nMENSTRUAL DISORDERS (Amenorrhea—1; Dysmenorrhea—1;\nMetrorrhagia; Oligomenorrhea)\nSYMPTOMS—Depression, tension, melancholia, breast tenderness, cramps, fainting, water retention,\nrapid heartbeat, and backache may occur.\nCAUSES—Menstruation is also called menarche. Women whose general health and resistance are good\nare less likely to have menstrual problems.\nAn irregular cycle often indicates the general state of a woman's health, and is usually the result of\nnutritional deficiencies or autointoxication caused by constipation, an organic malfunction, drugs,\nvitamin or mineral deficiency, and/or chemicals.\nAmenorrhea: Absence or suppression of menstruation.\nDysmenorrhea: Painful or difficult menstruation.\nMetrorrhagia: Bleeding between periods.\nOligomenorrhea: Infrequent or scanty menstruation.\nPeriods tend to stop in athletes and in women who drop below 20% body fat.\nThere are two types of dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation):\nPrimary dysmenorrhea usually does not occur until several years after menstruation begins. The pain\nbegins a few hours before or at the onset of bleeding, may last from a few hours to 1-2 days, and is\ngenerally worst the first day. At first, there is a scanty flow, which increases as the pain subsides.\nSecondary dysmenorrhea may start 2-3 days before onset, with pain in the abdomen, small of back, and\non down the legs. It is a more constant pain, but includes sharp cramps, and continues throughout the\nperiod. This type is often linked to a pelvic disorder (inflammation, uterine malposition, endometriosis,\ntumors, etc.), which needs to be eliminated in order to lessen or remove the pain.\nHormonal imbalance is usually involved (see \"Premenstrual Syndrome\").",

      "overview": "- The diet should contain an adequate, but not excessive, amount of high quality proteins,\npreferably from non-meat sources.\n- Eat complex carbohydrates (whole grains), to avoid blood sugar drops. This is important.\nBut do not overeat on anything. Low blood sugar is common during menstruation.\n- Include B complex, especially B and B ; along with vitamins C and E. Take brewer's\n12 6\nyeast, kelp, and essential fatty acids.\n- B vitamins, especially B and folic acid, help reduce some of the tensions associated\n6\nwith menstruation.\n- Deficiencies of essential fatty acids, together with cyclic hormonal patterns, produce the\nclassic symptoms of fragile emotions, irritability, etc.\n- Take vitamin A as beta-carotene during the last 14 days of the cycle.\n- Iron is vital because of the loss of blood each month. Vitamin C helps the body absorb\niron. Beware of supplemental iron during pregnancy! Iron-rich sources include blackstrap\nmolasses (best single source), apricots, and raisins. Iodine is also needed, when there is a\nblood loss. Eat kelp or dulse.\n- Calcium supplementation is very important, if you want to avoid painful cramps!\n- Cramping may be relieved by additional intake of calcium and niacin.\n- Manganese is needed for normal reproduction and the mammary glands, and helps\nprevent osteoporosis.\n- Vitamin B helps restore normal menstrual cycles.\n12\n- Limiting salt and fluid intake a short time before menstrual onset may help reduce edema\nin the legs and elsewhere in the body.\n- Food allergies can be involved in painful menstruation. In one study, eight patients were\nfreed of the problem when all foods they were allergic to were eliminated (see \"Allergies\"\nand \"Pulse Test\").\n- Allergenic foods most frequently listed were whey, milk, eggs, beef, chocolate, nuts,\nfish, beans, cauliflower, pepper, and cabbage.\n- Avoid overeating! This encourages abdominal congestion.\n- A low-salt diet helps relieve bloating and water retention.\n- Taking the birth control pill greatly upsets the entire hormonal system, and it does not\nrecover, even after the pill is stopped for many months or years.\n- Problems with the pituitary, adrenals, or thyroid may produce amenorrhea, or abnormal\nbleeding cycles. Stress or the birth control pill can seriously affect the adrenals (which\nproduce 20% of the total estrogen used by the body).\n- Extreme diets (strict fruitarianism, very low protein diets, or repeated strict weight loss\nregimens) can produce amenorrhea.\n- Poor body mechanics (poor posture) causes the female organs to move out of place, and\nthis can affect menstruation. Proper posture tends to reduce cramping.\n- Those who have diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing tend to have no menstrual pain.\nAvoid belts and tight clothing about the waist.\n- Adequate exercise is also needed.\n- Avoiding constipation is very important.\n- Avoid overfatigue just prior to the period. Maintain a regular daily schedule throughout\nthe month.\n- An excess of stress can also affect menstrual flow and attendant problems.\n- Sexual stimulation at that time of the month increases abdominal congestion.\n- If you are overweight, lose weight in order to reduce painful periods.\n- Using tobacco aggravates menstrual disorders. Smoking induces painful menstruation.\n- Take a daily hot sitz bath. If available, add chamomile or juniper needles to the water.\n- Or take two hot baths each day at the beginning of menstruation. This draws blood from\nthe over-congested uterus to the skin.\n- A four-minute back massage to an area an inch to the right of the lumbar (small of the\nback) spine may bring relief from painful menstruation.\n- A hot sitz bath (105o-115o F.) with a hot footbath (110o-117o F.) for 3-10 minutes is\noften helpful.\n- Drink catnip tea each morning and evening during the period.\n- Helpful herbs include: yarrow and blue cohosh in menstrual difficulties; wormwood and\npennyroyal, when there is painful menstruation; chamomile relieves menstrual spasms;\npeppermint tea eases the pain; desert tea (ephedra viridis), for delayed or difficult\nmenstruation; life root, when there is suppressed menstruation; black cohosh when there is\nobstructed menstruation; garlic and motherwort, to promote menstrual flow; amaranth and\nlady's mantle, when there is excessive menstruation; blazing star, for low-ovarian function\nand lack of estrogen.\n—See \"Premenstrual Syndrome\" for much more information.\n—Also see \"Lack of Menstruation\" and \"Painful Menstruation.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—All heaven is interested in the work going on in this world, to prepare people\nto live forever in heaven. It is important that we cooperate with God by accepting Christ as our Saviour\nand, by faith in Him, obeying the Ten Commandments.\nLACK OF MENSTRUATION (Amenorrhea) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,\nFormulas)\nBASIC APPLICATIONS—Tonic Sitz Bath; cold Pelvic Pack; Graduated Baths, twice daily, for tonic\npurposes; short very cold Douche to lower spine, over stomach, and to inner surfaces of thighs; pelvic\nmassage daily, and especially when period is due.\nSUPPRESSED MENSTRUATION—Short Cold Douche to spine, thighs, and over stomach, daily or\ntwice a day; Hot Footbath or Hot Blanket Pack during the interval between the periods; Hot Hip Pack;\nwarm vaginal irrigation at 950-1000 F.\nGENERAL METHOD—It is very necessary to seek for the problem and not merely to \"treat a\nmalady.\" Apply such measures as may be required for relief of anemia, chlorosis, indigestion, or any\nother disturbance of the nutritive functions.\n—Also see \"Menstrual Disorders.\"\nPAINFUL MENSTRUATION (Dysmenorrhea) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,\nFormulas)\nBASIC—Rest in bed during period.\nWHEN DUE TO OVARIAN DISEASE (beginning before flow)—Hot Hip and Leg Pack; Hot\nBlanket Pack; Fomentation over stomach; hot Pelvic Pack; Revulsive Sitz; hot Colonic, followed by hot\nFootbath if flow is checked; hot Douche at 990-1020 F.; very Hot Full Bath (1050-1100 F.) for 5-8\nminutes.\nWHEN DUE TO UTERINE DISEASE (beginning with, and accompanying, flow)—Hot Hip Pack\nwith Hot Footbath, followed by Cold Compress to area above stomach and inner surfaces of thighs for\n30-40 seconds.

      "overview": "Fomentations, Hot Pelvic Pack, Hot Blanket Pack.\nGENERAL METHOD—In addition to the local measures for relief of pain which have been indicated\nabove, it is in most cases necessary to combat some general disorder to which the local disease may be,\nmore or less, directly related. See \"Anemia,\" \"Neurasthenia,\" \"Hysteria.\" General tonic measures must\nbe used between the menstrual periods. In chronic ovarian congestion, apply the stomach compress\nduring the night; daily give a Revulsive Sitz Bath or Hot Pelvic Pack and the very hot vaginal irrigation,\n1150-1200 F., for 15 minutes. In cases of deficient development, as in infantile uterus or nerve spasm of\nthe uterine vessels, employ the Revulsive Sitz Bath, alternate genito-urinary douche, tonic sitz bath,\npelvic and general massage. Surgical measures are often required for permanent relief, but a surprisingly\nlarge number of cases are resolvable without surgery; hence water therapies should be perseveringly\ntried before resorting to surgical procedures.\n—Also see \"Menstrual Disorders.\"\nMENOPAUSE (Climacteric, Change of Life)\nSYMPTOMS—Hot flashes, insomnia, disturbances in calcium metabolism, irritability, mental\ninstability, dizziness, backaches, headaches, bladder problems, dryness and aging of the skin, shortness\nof breath, and heart palpitations. Some have almost no symptoms at all.\nCAUSES—Menopause is the cessation of ovarian function, the stopping of the menstrual cycle, and the\nend of reproductive years. This is caused by glandular changes, and is a natural event in a woman's life;\nthis usually occurs between 42 and 55. The average age is about 50, and the transition is generally up to\n5 years.\nThere tends to be a hormone starvation at that time, since menopause usually results from a decreased\nproduction of the female sex hormones.\nThe lessened supply of estrogen increases the possibility of cardiovascular disease, vaginal atrophy, and\nosteoporosis.\nIt is popular to take estrogen supplements, to prevent or postpone menopausal symptoms. But keep in\nmind that there is an increased risk of cancer when this is done.\nIf estrogen (hormone replacement) therapy is begun, take vitamin E several hours earlier or later, not at\nthe same time.\nIn addition, generous amounts of vitamins B , C, folic acid, pantothenic acid, PABA, and B will make\n6 12\nthe estrogen therapy more effective.\nOral estrogens should not be accompanied by progesterone because they increase the cancer induction\nrisk.\nKeep in mind that synthetic, not natural, estrogens are given in hormone replacement therapy. These\ntend to accumulate in the body, and also can cause metabolic changes in the liver. This can lead to high\nblood pressure, fluid retention, and blood clots. But natural estrogens are available; one is equine\nestrogen, and is extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. But it is very powerful, and may also cause\nchanges in the liver. Do not use it if you are obese, smoke, or have high blood pressure, high cholesterol,\nor varicose veins.\nThe safest natural estrogens are estropipate (Ogen) and estradiol (Estrace, Emcyt, and Estraderm); these\nare all metabolized more easily by your body. Be sure and use the smallest possible dose, and take it\nonly every other day.\nIt is coming to be recognized that it is often more important to replace the lessened progesterone than the\nlessened estrogen. Natural progesterone creams (from the herb, wild yam) provide a simplified way to\ndo this. Many, many, have been helped by doing this!\nWhen the menopause proceeds normally, the adrenals and liver increase their output of female hormones\nand make up the difference from the lost ovarian function.\nProper diet, nutritional supplements, exercise, and adequate rest can minimize the effects of menopause.\nTREATMENT—Vitamin E (up to 1,200 IU daily) is especially important at this time.\n- Vitamin C, working with bioflavonoids, maintains capillary strength.\n- The B complex vitamins, especially pantothenic acid and PABA, relieve nervous\nirritability.\n- It is very important that sufficient calcium be taken, to maintain a proper calciumphosphorous balance. Not doing so can also result in a broken hip later.\n- An increase in protein and reduction in carbohydrates is recommended at this time.\n- Maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D, iron, and magnesium.\n- Eliminate all processed, refined, and junk foods. This includes white sugar and whiteflour products.\n- Raw fruit and vegetable juices, brewer's yeast, lecithin, kelp, and cold-pressed vegetable\noils are needed. The diet should be at least 50% raw food.\n- Avoid animal products and dairy products.\n- Do not use alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, sugar, and hot soups and drinks. They make\nthe emotional swings worse and the blood more acidic. This causes the bones to release\nextra calcium, to balance blood pH and weaken the bones if extra calcium is not taken.\n- Substitute garlic and onion powder for salt. Consuming salt increases urinary excretion\nof calcium.\n- Drink 2 quarts of water each day, to help prevent drying of skin and mucous membranes.\n- After menopause begins, you will not have as much calcium in your body, due to the\nlessened estrogen; it is important that you henceforth supplement with calcium. Of the\n250,000 hip fractures that occur in the U.S. every year, 80% are due to osteoporosis.\n- Avoid mental and emotional stress and worry. Be happy with the blessings you have,\nand thank God for them.\n- Get plenty of outdoor exercise and sufficient rest. Lay down and rest a little before lunch\nand supper. A lack of exercise weakens bone density.\n- Especially important are vitamins E, C, A, and B complex, including PABA and\npantothenic acid.\n- Hypothyroidism is common during menopause, and is responsible for a number of the\nsymptoms. Be sure and take additional amounts of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp.\n- Helpful herbs include lady's mangle, motherwort, and St. John's wort.\n—Also see \"Menstrual Disorders\" for related information.\nENCOURAGEMENT—All the instructions we need to obey God is found in the Bible. Read it every\nday; and, accompanied by earnest prayer for help, you will receive the strength needed to fulfill God's\nwill one day at a time.",

Warm the douche to body temperature before taking.\nPossible douches include:\n4-8 ounces of diluted vinegar to a pint of distilled water, 4-8 ounces of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 ounce\nof bayberry myrtle (myrica cerifera) to 1 pint water.\nA replant of lactobacillus acidophilus may be needed, to normalize flora after vaginitis or antibiotic drug\nmedications. Plain, unsweetened yogurt (4 ounces) can be emptied into warm water (10-20 oz.).\nRoutine douching is not necessary for personal hygiene. Douching is best reserved for therapy, in time\nof infection. Excessive douching may actually help promote infection.\nWARNING—Douching may induce pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In one study, almost 90% of\nthe women with PID were vigorous douchers, often since the age of 16 or 17. Very likely, infected fluid\nis flushed up into the uterine cavity by the douche.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Home is to be the center of the purest and most elevated affection.

A single attack of this disease produces sterility about 15% of the time.\nIt is believed that this disorder owes its origin to unsanitary conditions, especially during intercourse.\nThe use of intrauterine devices is another cause. The disorder was over four times higher in IUD users.\nThey may not have been sterile or may have been inserted by hands that had not been carefully washed.\nDouching is yet a third cause of this problem.

Avoid junk food.\nDo not use tobacco, caffeine, or alcohol.\n- For pain relief, apply heat to the lower back or abdomen. Sitz baths are also helpful.\n- A hot half bath is useful in fighting the infection.\n- Every 4 hours, take a hot footbath while ice bags are on the lower abdomen for 30\nminutes, followed by 30 minutes rest in bed. This will speed the healing process.\nENCOURAGEMENT—A great name among men is as letters traced in sand, but a spotless character\nwill endure to all eternity. God stands ready to help all willing to surrender their lives, so He can help\nthem live a clean life.\nMETRITIS, CHRONIC (Inflammation of Uterus) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,\nFormulas)\nBASIC APPLICATIONS—Graduated cold applications; hot vaginal irrigation, 10-15 minutes, twice\ndaily; Hot Blanket Pack to legs with cold pelvic pack (Wet Sheet Pack over pelvic area), continued to\nsweating stage, followed by cold friction or Wet Sheet Rub.\nPAIN—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath at 950-970 F., for 15-20 minutes.\nLEUKORRHEA—In addition to the above measures, antiseptic vaginal irrigation. In certain cases,\ncool irrigation, at 750-650 F., produces better results than hot irrigation. Constipation and portal\ncongestion must be relieved. Cervical catarrh and erosions often require the use of the curette (a spoonshaped scraping instrument for removing foreign matter from a cavity).\nACUTE INFLAMMATION—If attacks of inflammation occur, rest in bed. Hot Hip or Leg Pack. Hot\nand cold pelvic compress or hot and cold pelvic pack.\nUTERINE BLEEDING (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC APPLICATIONS—Hot vaginal irrigation; short Hot Hip Pack; Hot Footbath, followed by\nCold Compress over stomach and inner surfaces of thighs. In obstinate cases, cold vaginal irrigation.\nModerately prolonged, very cold, Shallow Sitz Bath at 500-650 F. for 5-15 minutes, accompanied by Hot\nFootbath when other measures fail; hot Douche to lower spine area over stomach and inner surfaces of\nthighs, twice daily during intervals.\nCAUTIONS—Avoid prolonged Hot Sitz Bath, Hot Douche, Hot Leg Bath, Hot Footbath, or Hot Sitz\nBath, and in some cases even Fomentations and hot vaginal irrigation. It is equally necessary to avoid\nshort cold applications to the lower spine, abdomen, thighs, and feet, as the reflex effects of such\napplications increase pelvic and uterine congestion.\nGENERAL METHOD—It is always highly important to inquire closely for all possible causes of the\nprofuse flow. The cause may be simple anemia from defective nutrition, constipation, sexual excess,\nenteroptosis, uterine displacement, ovarian or tubal disease, uterine inflammation, or congestion. The\nmost common cause is vegetation of the endometrium, which must be removed by surgical measures.\nThe operation must be followed by treatment for chronic metritis. In many instances, several of these\nconditions may be combined. Good results generally follow water treatments.\nNOTE—The following two paragraphs were typed as part of the \"how to stop bleeding\" section, but\nthey have been placed here instead because they are lengthy, cover the subject of uterine bleeding well,\nand are not effectively duplicated in this present section of Kellogg formulas.\nFor hemorrhage from the uterus, apply short, very hot fomentations (or the hot douche) to the thighs\nand spine while an ice bag is placed over the lower abdomen and a hot vaginal douche is given. Another\nvery useful procedure for uterine hemorrhage is this: a very short hot douche to the lower back, the inner\nsurfaces of the thighs, and the soles of the feet. Prolonged cold applications to the same surfaces produce\nlike effects. These applications may be made either with or without a simultaneous use of the hot uterine\nor vaginal douche, according to the severity of the case.\nCaution: Cold applications must not be used in cases of menorrhagia (excessive bleeding during\nmenstruation, either in amount of loss or number of days), except with the utmost care and discretion, on\naccount of the danger of producing hematoma or hematosalpinx, through the sudden checking of the\noutflow of blood. Therefore, use only less strong measures during the first 24 or 36 hours of the period.\nReserve the cold applications to a later time. During the first day: The hot vaginal douche is better and\nsafer. \"The danger of producing hematoma is, in the author's opinion, very small after the first day.\"\nKellogg then tells of a girl who had suffered for nearly a year without relief, although she had gone to\nmany physicians. When brought to him, she was \"placed at once in a sitz bath of about 500 F. for 15\nminutes, the feet being placed in cold water at the same time, with the result that the hemorrhage ceased\nat once; and, by continued and repeated application of the cool sitz bath for a few weeks, the difficulty\nwas relieved. The above measures will not solve the problem when the hemorrhage is due to\nvegetations, a uterine fibroid, or a malignant disease. In cases where the hemorrhage is accompanied by\nsevere nerve pain or acute pelvic inflammation, use very hot rather than very cold applications to the\ninside of the thighs and lower back region. This should be brief and the temperature sufficiently high to\nbe somewhat painful, and is best done by sponging the parts with water at 1400 F. or by applying, for 1\n2 minutes, cloths wrung from 140o F. water.\nUTERINE FIBROIDS (Fibroids, Uterine Fibroma)\nSYMPTOMS—In half of all cases, there are no symptoms. But these growths can cause abnormally\nheavy and frequent menstrual periods, or even result in infertility. Other possible indications: anemia,\nfatigue, bleeding between periods, weakness from blood loss, increased vaginal discharge, bleeding after\nintercourse.\nCAUSES—A uterine fibroid is a benign tumor, varying in size from a millet seed to a size large enough\nto fill the entire abdominal cavity. May be single or multiple. The tumors are completely covered by a\nfibrous connective tissue capsule.\nFibroids rarely cause symptoms before the age of 30, but is common after that age, especially among\nblacks; 20-30% of women have them. The type of symptoms shown depends on where the fibroids are\nlocated. They can exert pressure and cause pain to the bladder, bowels, or even block the urethra\n(producing kidney obstruction).\nWhen they produce no symptoms, they should be left alone, but should be removed if unusually rapid\ngrowth occurs.\nIf the flow is far too heavy or rapid, you may have interfering fibroids.",

      "overview": "- Taking oral contraceptives increases the likelihood of developing fibroids.\n- If found, do not take oral contraceptives with a high-estrogen content; the estrogen may\nmake them enlarge faster.\n- Over 30% of the hysterectomies done in the U.S. are for the purpose of removing\nfibroids. But, if possible, do not remove them. Fibroids generally shrink when menopause\nbegins. This is due to the decreased amount of estrogen in the body from that time\nonward.\n- An alternate surgery is a myomectomy, which removes the fibroids and leaves the uterus\nintact. It is true that there is a slightly higher possibility of complications with a\nmyomectomy, and the results are not always permanent (50% of the time new fibroids\nwill appear).

(Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the membranous coat lining the abdominal\ncavity (see \"Peritonitis\").\nCAUSES—Salpingitis is inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Ovaritis is inflammation of the ovaries.\nOvaritis may involve the substance of the organ (oophoritis) or its surface (perioophoritis), and may be\nacute or chronic. These technical words are defined because it is easy to confuse ovaritis and oophoritis\nin the medical literature.\nThe fallopian tubes and ovaries are normally protected by the acidic vagina, the mucous plug of the\ncervix, and cilia in the uterus and fallopian tubes. But there are five situations, during which infection\ncan more easily penetrate those delicate organs:\nDuring menstruation, the vagina is alkaline, the plug is gone, and only a healthy flow protects the\nfallopian tubes and ovaries from infection. Sexual activity, during a period, can introduce bacteria.\nDuring and just after childbirth.\nFollowing an abortion. It has been well-documented that abortion clinics tend to operate on a massproduction basis instead of the careful and sterile conditions one would find in a hospital operating\nroom.\nUse of an IUD is also a significant cause of infection.\nGeneral enervation or local congestion, due to a variety of causes—ranging from poor diet, overwork,\nconstipation, pelvic infections, etc.\nOnce salpingitis or oophoritis occurs, there is a 70% likelihood of sterility.",

There are four types:\n1 - Yeast vaginitis, also called monilial, or thrush. The yeast infection causing it is candida albicans. It is\nmore common in pregnant women, diabetics, and those on antibiotics, oral contraceptives, or long-term\nsteroid therapy. Changes in the vaginal pH (caused by tap water, tub baths, certain additives to bath\nwater, and some commercial douches) permit the yeast to grow in the vagina. The discharge is moderate\nin amount, but thick yellowish or white and curd-like. It may cause severe itching of the external\ngenitalia (see \"Candida\").\n2 - Trichomonas, caused by trichomonas vaginalis. This is a protozoan which likes an alkaline\nenvironment. It may be sexually transmitted (so both should be treated at the same time). In the man,\nthere are no symptoms; in the woman, there is a greenish white or heavy yellow, frothy, discharge which\nmay have a slight odor. The discharge causes itching, burning, and reddening of the skin. If it spreads to\nthe urethra, there may be frequent burning urination. Flagyl, which is a medication for this, is known to\ncause cancer in animals.\n3 - Non-specific vaginitis is caused by organisms other than yeast or trichomonas, and occurs when\nresistance is low and the normal vaginal flora changes.\n4 - Atrophic vaginitis occurs in post-menopausal women and those whose ovaries have been surgically\nremoved. Adhesions form and there is a high susceptibility to infection. Symptoms include itching or\nburning, painful intercourse, and a thin watery discharge, sometimes tinged with blood.\nVaginitis may have one or more of the following causes: bacterial or fungal infection, intestinal worms,\nvitamin B deficiency, congestion of the pelvic organs, gonococci, chemical irritation (strong douches),\nmechanical irritation (tampons), drug medications, and deodorant sprays.\nOther contributing factors include tight and nonporous clothing, diabetes, and the use of antibiotics.\nThe birth control pill causes a B deficiency and changes the vaginal pH.\n6\nPregnancy increases the vaginal pH, and also its glycogen content. This is favorable to yeast infection.\nBut it generally leaves\nTight-fitting synthetic underwear provides poor ventilation and a warm, moist, environment for yeast\ninfection to occur.\nExcess sugar and refined carbohydrates help feed yeast infection.\nNormally, the pH of the vagina is acid; anything that alkalinizes it contributes to vaginitis. Causes\ninclude diabetes, menstrual period, pregnancy, and the time just after a miscarriage or abortion.\nThe most common aftereffect of antibiotic therapy in women is a vaginal yeast infection.\nFrequent douching upsets vaginal pH and flora.\nExcessive sex or intercourse, without proper lubrication, irritates vaginal walls.\nAbout 5% of women given tetracycline for acne develop vaginitis.\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) produce a favorable environment for yeast infection, since they reduce\nnormal vaginal secretions.\nFour primary factors are antibiotics, oral contraceptives, diabetes, and pregnancy.",

If so, apply\na vinegar douche (1-4 tablespoon of vinegar to 1 quart water) twice a day for 7 days, then\nonce a day for 30 days.\n- Garlic-water douche (1 clove into part of a quart of boiling water; add the remainder of\nthe quart, let cool to 110o F. twice a day for 7 days, then once a day for 30 days).\n- For organisms other than yeast and trichomonas, a warm normal saline douche (1\nteaspoon of salt per quart water) is useful.\n- Hot sitz baths, 2-3 times a day will soothe local irritation; but it is important that the tub\nbe sterilized first, lest bacteria be introduced into the vagina.\n- An alternate method is to apply garlic suppositories. Peel a clove of garlic and wrap it in\na piece of sterile gauze. Lubricate the suppository with pure organic vegetable oil and\ninsert it in the vagina, yet keep a piece protruding outside. Continue doing this for 3 days,\nchanging suppositories every 3 hours.\n- Adequate rest, a healthful diet, and meticulous personal hygiene with frequent bathing\nare important.\n- Take vitamins A and B complex.\n- Avoid panty hose, girdles, or synthetic pants or panties. Tight-fitting clothing increases\nmoisture retention. Wear cotton clothing.\n- Avoid chemical deodorant sprays, tampons, and colored toilet paper. Do not use\ncommercial sexual lubricants.\n- Beware of tub baths! Take showers instead.\n- Do not wash socks and stockings with underwear, lest foot infections be transferred to\nthe pelvic organs.\n- Cotton underwear can be microwaved to destroy yeast. Wet it, wring it out well, and\nmicrowave on high for 30 seconds.\n- Do not have marital relations during menstruation or infections or, if you can avoid it, a\nfew days immediately afterward.\n- Require that your husband wash his hands and genitals before intercourse. If he really\nloves you, he will gladly do this.\n- Tea tree oil is good for vaginitis. Use creams, suppositories, etc.\n- Aloe vera is helpful for infections, including yeast infections. It can be taken internally\nor used as a douche.\n- Also helpful are bayberry, goldenseal, yarrow, marshmallow root, calendula, chamomile,\npau d'arco, and dandelion.\n- To normalize vaginal flora, eat plain yogurt and/or apply it to the vagina.\n- Include adequate fiber in the diet.\n- Do not take iron supplements until the infection is reduced. Infectious bacteria require\niron for growth.\n- Apply an opened vitamin E capsule to the area, to reduce itching.\n- For atrophic vaginitis, use natural progesterone cream and apply to the vagina.\nPrescription ointments for this condition contain estrogen. But they increase the need for\nvitamin B . Vaginal absorption of estrogen may be dangerous.\n6\n- Do not use sweet-smelling douches. A plain yogurt douche is much better. (Also see\n\"Douches.\")\n- If you have chronic or persistent vaginitis, you may have diabetes.\n- If you have recurring vaginitis, you may be getting it from your husband.\n- For more information on dealing with a yeast infection, see \"Candida\" and \"Athlete's\nFoot.\"\n—Related articles include \"Candida,\" \"Chlamydia,\" \"Toxic Shock,\" \"Leukorrhea,\" and \"Douches.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—By sin, earth was cut off from heaven and alienated from its communion.

These may include urinary tract\nproblems, lengthy and heavy periods, a heavy and bloated feeling, abdominal swelling due to fibroids,\ninfertility resulting from fibroids or endometriosis, or reactions to drugs given for endometriosis.\nBut the problems resulting from a hysterectomy are, if anything, more significant:\nThe hormones are suddenly stopped. This sends shock waves throughout the entire system.\nLack of those hormones can result in immense bone mass loss, osteoporosis, and greater likelihood of\nheart disease, depression, urinary tract problems, dizziness, insomnia, headaches, and general fatigue.\nEven those women who do not have their ovaries cut out still experience a drastic lessening of estrogen\noutput. In addition, menopause begins years earlier for half the women who are spared their ovaries.\nDepression may also occur, and reduced sexual desire frequently does. There is a 50% chance of a minor\npost-operative complication, such as fever, bleeding, or wound healing.

But modern technology permits them to be examined, by ultrasound, for abnormalities. A\nmyomectomy should be performed to remove problematic fibroids, not a hysterectomy. (Also see\n\"Fibroids.\")\nWomen who have hysterectomies have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.\nIf you decide to have a hysterectomy, ask that a horizontal incision be made, not a vertical one.

      "overview": "- If you have had a hysterectomy, eat a nutritious diet, with vitamin/mineral\nsupplementation. This will reduce the amount of estrogen deprivation, especially if you\nstill have your ovaries.\n- If you do use hormonal replacement, take the lowest dosage possible. Ask for a\ncombined hormone containing both estrogen and progesterone. That will help reduce the\nrisk of cancer. Progesterone, not estrogen, is the hormone most needed in replacement\ntherapy.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Keep your thoughts on Christ and the heavenly world, and you will have more\nstrength for the trials of life. Talk His praise and rest in His love.\nSection 13\nReproductive\nPart 4\nMale Pelvic Organs\nSPERMATORRHEA—1 (Nocturnal Emission)\nSYMPTOMS—Involuntary loss of semen, without orgasm, often while asleep.\nCAUSES AND TREATMENT—The male generative organs, the testes, must remain somewhat cooler\nthan body temperature. When they become overheated (by taking a hot tub bath), a release of sperm will\nbe made in the night, since that supply of sperm has become damaged.\nIf you sleep too warm at night, due to an electric sleeping blanket set on high, the overheated testicles\nwill eject sperm the next day.\nAnother cause is visual or thought sexual stimulation. A poor diet is another cause.\nA low-protein diet, free from the use of eggs may also prove of benefit.\n—Also see \"Spermatorrhea—2.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Pray with unshaken faith and trust. The Angel of the covenant, even our Lord\nJesus Christ, is the Mediator who secures the acceptance of the prayers of His believing ones. God can\ngive you the help you need.\nSPERMATORRHEA—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC—Graduated cold applications, to improve general conditions.\nGENERAL NERVOUS IRRITABILITY—Prolonged Neutral Bath at night.\nIRRITABLE PROSTATE, IRRITABLE URETHRA—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath, 30-60 minutes,\nat bedtime; Revulsive Douche to perineum with little pressure; tepid Colonic at 800 F.\nRELAXED EJACULATORY DUCTS—Rubbing Cold Sitz Bath; cold or alternate hot and cold\nColonic; Cold Douche to feet and legs; Cold percussion Douche to lower spine. Bowels must be kept\nregular by the Cool Enema, if necessary, and proper diet. An aseptic dietary is essential. Condiments\nmust be strictly avoided.\nCAUTION—When losses are frequent or parts irritable, avoid Cold Sitz Baths and prolonged Hot\nBaths.\n—Also see \"Spermatorrhea—1.\"\nPROSTATE DISORDERS (Prostatitis; Enlarged Prostate, Prostate\nHypertrophy; Prostate Cancer)\nSYMPTOMS—Pain on urination, frequent urination, urine retention, often a fever. There may be a\ndischarge.\nAcute prostatitis: fever, frequent and burning urination, pain between the scrotum and rectum, a feeling\nof fullness in the bladder, pus or blood in the urine.\nChronic prostatitis: frequent and burning urination, blood in the urine, lower back pain, impotence\n(inability to copulate).\nGradually, urination becomes still more difficult.\nCAUSES—The prostate is a doughnut-shaped male reproductive gland. It is under the urinary bladder,\nand surrounds the urinary tube (urethra).\nMuscles located within the prostate squeeze prostatic fluid into the urethral tract during ejaculation.\nMost of the semen consists of this fluid, which provides nourishment and protection for the sperm.\nThere are three primary prostatic problems:\nProstatitis: This is inflammation of the prostate gland, is common in men of all ages, and is the most\nfrequent type of prostate problem.\nThe inflammation tends to block off the urine flow (urine retention), and this causes bacteria to build up.\nSometimes hormonal changes, from aging, may be a contributing factor.\nWhen urine retention results, the bladder becomes distended, weak, tender, and liable to infection.\nInfection can easily pass up the ureters to the kidneys.\nEnlarged prostate: This is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy. It is the gradual enlargement of the\nprostate, and occurs in half of all men over 50, and three-fourths of men over 70. It is probably the most\ncommon infirmity of aging in the human male. More than 500,000 American men are afflicted each\nyear.\nIt is believed that, with age, testosterone production and levels decrease, and certain other hormones\n(prolactin and estradiol) increase. This results in more of a powerful form of testosterone, called\ndihydrotestosterone. This hormone causes an overproduction (hyperplasia) of prostate cells—and that\ncauses the prostate gland to become larger. As it does, it eventually tends to pinch upon the urethra, and\ninterfere with the flow of urine.\nAs a result, neither the bladder nor kidneys empty fully. This produces pressure which can damage them.\nUrination becomes more frequent. It flows more slowly, and there may be difficulty in starting and\nstopping the flow. Sometimes there is blood in the urine.\nHere is how to check your own prostate:\nThe prostate can be felt (palpated) with the gloved finger. If you are going to do this effectively, you\nwould need to examine it monthly. The normal prostate is firm like an orange and about the size of a\nwalnut. You would reach into the rectum, to carry out this examination. The prostate is found at a depth\nin the rectum that is just comfortably in reach of the index finger. An acute case of enlargement may be\nhard while a chronic enlargement may be boggy. Tumors, either benign or malignant tend to be irregular\nand nodular.\nProstatic cancer: An enlarged prostate can become cancerous; but, fortunately, it always proceeds very,\nvery, slowly. So slowly, in fact, that an operation to remove the prostate, because of cancer, is generally\nnot needed. This is because, before the man is likely to die of prostate cancer, he is quite aged and dies\nof something else first. But, of course, you will want to consult your medical specialist.\nThe suggestions below are for prostate problems, in general. For more information on home care, in\nthose instances in which cancer is present, see \"Cancer.\"\nVasectomy, for sterilization, has been linked to prostate disorders and even cancer.",

      "overview": "- Avoid sexual stimulation without a natural conclusion (an orgasm). Continued\nstimulation leads to a prolonged engorgement. This is not good for the prostate.\n- Avoiding sexual activity entirely is the best way to care for your prostate in the older\nyears.\n- Maintain optimal physical and emotional health. Avoid that which is sexually\nstimulating.\n- Regular exercise outdoors in the open air is important. Walking for an hour or two every\nday is excellent.\n- Riding bicycles, motorcycles, or horses may injure the perineum, resulting in congestion\nof the prostate.\n- Avoid exposure to dampness or cold.\n- Avoid constipation. This is important.\n- Do not sit for hours on padded seats in cold places (such as buses, trains, etc.). Whenever\npossible, sit on a hard chair. This reduces compression.\n- Increase fluid intake, in order to flush the kidneys and bladder of toxins and bacteria.\n- Do not let the bladder become too full. Urinate as quickly as possible, when the urge\ncomes. Try to completely empty the bladder each time.\n- Do not eat junk food, fried food, caffeine, spices, chocolate, nuts (especially cashews),\nor drink alcohol or use nicotine.\n- Eat a nourishing diet, including vitamin/mineral supplementation, especially zinc.\n- The diets of those who have prostate trouble are usually low in essential fatty acids\n(flaxseed oil and wheat germ oil are the best). Never heat these oils.\n- Treat it with zinc (50 mg, three times a day), essential fatty acids (flaxseed oil, 1\nteaspoon, three times a day), and a high-fiber diet which includes pumpkin seeds and\nalfalfa. Vitamin A (as beta-carotene, 300,000 IU a day), vitamin C to bowel tolerance,\nchlorophyll (as alfalfa), selenium (250 mcg, three times a day), amino acids (alanine,\nglycine, and glutamic acid; 5 grams each, daily for 90 days), and cranberry juice (2 pints a\nday).\n- Many medicinal drugs, including pilocarpine, irritate the prostate.\n- When there is an acute condition, take hot sitz baths daily and add chamomile tea to the\nwater.\n- Also helpful is a short cold bath.\n- A high charcoal and water enema helps the healing process. Use 1 cup of hot water to 1\nteaspoon of powdered charcoal. Allow it to remain as long as possible.\n- In order to increase circulation in the area, lay flat on your back on the floor. Then swing\none leg across the other till the knee touches the floor and vice versa. Do this as many\ntimes as you can, and eventually bring it up to 50 repetitions at a time.\n- Helpful herbs include echinacea and goldenseal, for bactericide. Horsetail, combined\nwith hydrangea, helps contract the prostate. Saw palmetto and cayenne are also useful.\n—Also see \"Prostatitis\" and \"Prostate Cancer.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Cling to God with all your heart, and He will guide you aright. You need His\nhelp every moment. Trust and obey His Written Word.\nPROSTATITIS (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC APPLICATIONS—Revulsive Sitz Bath; Hot Colonic; Neutral Sitz Bath, for 30-60 seconds;\nCold Mitten Friction.\nPAIN—Revulsive Sitz Bath; Fomentation or the Revulsive Douche to perineum, with little pressure;\nColonic in chronic cases. Hot Enema, when bowels are constipated.\nCHRONIC ENLARGEMENT WITH INDURATION—Good results often follow the use of the\nfollowing measures: alternate hot and cold Colonic; Shallow Cold Rubbing Sitz Bath, for 4-8 minutes;\ncold pelvic pack (Wet Sheet Pack over pelvic area) with Hot Leg Pack; massage of prostate; graduated\ntonic baths; ice bag to perineum, with Hot Hip and Leg Pack for 15-30 minutes.\nCAUTIONS—When pain is present, avoid general cold baths, cold Sitz Baths, Cold Footbaths, and\nchilling of feet. Absolute sexual continence is essential.\nTESTICLE INFLAMMATION, ACUTE (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nBASIC POINTS—Rest in bed; elevation of scrotum upon a tense broad band of cloth, placed about the\nthighs close to hips; Hot Pelvic Pack or Hot Hip Pack with Cold Compress over genitals, every 3 hours.\nDuring intervals, Compress at 600 F. over perineum, genitals, and over stomach, with heat to feet. Tepid\nEnema, twice daily; Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub, twice a day; prolonged Neutral Bath or\nNeutral Pack to control temperature, if necessary.",

Either the woman or the man may be the cause (see\n\"Impotence, Male\"). Infertility usually means that the problem can be reversed; sterility means that the\nsituation is permanent. An estimated 20% of American couples experience infertility. Determining the\nexact cause can be difficult.\nIn general, 60% of couples conceive within 6 months, and 90% within a year. If you both are under 28,\nand have no reason to think otherwise, you ought to have a baby within a year.\nA frequent cause is a deficiency in one or more nutrients.\nThe problem may be that the woman is not cycling and ovulating properly. If she has less than 20%\nbody fat, she may not.\nOther causes include inherited disorders, infections, venereal disease, mishandled abortions,\nendometriosis, bacterial organisms, drugs, plugged fallopian tubes, emotional trauma, or frigidity (which\nsee).\nIf you are producing milk or have male-pattern hair growth on your breasts, upper lip, or chin, you may\nhave a hormonal imbalance.\nYou or your spouse may have had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease which can destroy the\nfallopian tubes in women and inflame and scar the ductile system in men. Over 4,000 Americans\ncontract this disease yearly.\nYou may have had pelvic infections, endometriosis, polycystic ovary disease, abdominal or urinary tract\nsurgery, injuries to the perineum, excessively high fevers, the mumps or measles. You may have used an\nintrauterine device (IUD).\nOne of you may have been exposed to a harmful chemical, such as lead.\nKidney problems can result in reproductive imbalances. Clean out the kidneys.\nIn rare instances, women develop antibodies to their partner's sperm.\nIn some cases, one or the other is only half-hearted about having a baby.",

A high-protein diet, essential fatty acids, vitamins A, B\ncomplex, zinc, germanium, and CoQ10.\n- A deficiency of selenium can lead to infertility in women.\n- Vitamin E is very important if you wish to conceive.\n- Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a B vitamin which stimulates the pituitary gland and\nsometimes restores fertility to a woman.\n- Test for food allergies (see \"Pulse Test\").\n- Avoid white flour, fried, sugar, junk, and caffeine foods. Do not eat animal fats.\n- A gluten-free diet has enabled women, who previously were unable to conceive, to\nbecome pregnant.\n- Stop smoking and do not be around cigarette smoke.\n- Avoid caffeine and medicinal drugs. Caffeine can prevent pregnancy from beginning.\n- There is the possibility that you have had heavy metal poisoning.\n- Women who drink alcohol can prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in their womb.\n- Helpful herbs include black cohosh, red clover, yellow dock, wild yam, chamomile,\nskullcap, dong quai.\n- Black cohosh balances hormones, False unicorn, wild yam, and dong quai help increase\nfertility.\n- The use of natural progesterone cream has helped many women become pregnant. An\nexcellent alternative is wild yam, which contains progesterone. Rub it on the abdomen.\n- Avoid stress.\n- The closer a woman's weight is to the ideal, the more likely she is to conceive.\n- Do not exercise too much at that time.

Beware of commercial douches,\nlubrication agents, and jellies.\n- Use egg whites instead of petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly might kill the sperm; the egg\nwhites may help them in their journey. Only use egg whites during the few days each\nmonth when the woman is fertile. Egg whites are pure protein; a study, in Canada, found\nthat it was the best lubricant to use if conception was desired. Take the egg out of the\nrefrigerator earlier, so it will not be cold, and separate the yolk form the white.\n- Do not work so hard that you are fatigued. It is well-known that people who go on a\nvacation trip are more likely to conceive. They have more time to relax and rest up.\n- Make sure you time it just right.\n- The woman should remain lying down for 20 minutes after ejaculation.\n- If a woman has developed antibodies to her husband's sperm, avoid releasing sperm for a\nmonth (via a condom, etc.).

Whatever path God chooses is the very best for us.\nFEMALE INFERTILITY—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nGENERAL CARE—When not due to organic disease, this may be eliminated by a course of water\ntreatments. A series of graduated cold applications (Tonic Frictions) is most useful. The Cold Rubbing\nSitz is highly useful. Remove catarrhal conditions of uterus and vagina and subinvolution by means of\nhot vaginal irrigation, followed by tonic (cool or cold) Sitz.\nMALE IMPOTENCE—1 (Male Fertility Problems)\nSYMPTOMS—Inability of a man to produce viable sperm which will unite with an ovum and result in\nconception.\nCAUSES—There are more than 20 million sperm in a teaspoon. The most frequent cause of male\ninfertility is low sperm count or an anatomical abnormality. Sperm factors account for 40% of all cases\nof infertility.\nFactors affecting this include excessive heat to the testes, exposure to toxins or radiation alcohol\nconsumption, endocrine disorders, recent acute illness, or prolonged fever. Any viral illness associated\nwith a fever up to 3 months earlier. Testicular mumps is another cause.\nA very common structural damage problem in men is a varicocele. This is a dilated vein of the spermatic\nduct.\nIf your sperm count is healthy, a cold or flue probably will affect it. But if sperm count is borderline, an\nillness might render you infertile for a time.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—A variety of problems can occur during pregnancy—ranging from backache,\nconstipation, stretch marks, and gas, to hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and miscarriage.\nINTRODUCTION—Pregnancy is that special 40-week period between conception and birth when the\nchild grows and develops. A weight gain of 20-35 pounds is desirable and, in most cases, is in keeping\nwith good health. But a number of problems can occur. Here are several of them. For more information,\nsee \"Morning Sickness,\" \"Premature Labor,\" and \"Miscarriage.\"\nMany of the problems occurring during pregnancy are related to hormonal changes, nutritional needs, or\nvarious expansion pressures as the fetus continues to grow.\nNUTRITION—Proper nutrition is important. There is a 20% increase of blood volume during\npregnancy. This requires additional complete protein.\nA healthy diet during this time would include 2 fruits a day, 7 vegetables (including salads, grains, and\nother worthwhile foods), etc. Complex carbohydrates, best obtained in whole grains, are important.\nComplete, vitamin/mineral supplementation is also important.\nVitamin A protects the immune system and avoids eye abnormalities, cleft lip, and cleft palate. Do not\nlet vitamin A intake go over 10,000 IU daily. Excessive intake of vitamin A is linked to cleft palate,\nheart defects, and other congenital defects. Foods rich in vitamin A may also cause problems. But foods\nwith natural beta-carotene are not harmful. (This is because it is only converted to vitamin A as it is\nneeded.)\nAll the B complex is important. They help prevent leg, back, and joint pains in the mother during\npregnancy.\nVitamin B (thiamine) prevents stillbirths, low-birth weight babies, and heart disorders. In late\n1\npregnancy and post-delivery, B requirements are greatly increased.\n1\nVitamin B (riboflavin) prevents short limbs and cleft palate.\n2\nVitamin B (niacin, niacinamide) prevents irritability, depression, disorientation, fatigue, nervousness,\n3\nand muscular weakness.\nVitamin B (pyridoxine) prevents several fetal abnormalities, including seizures, cleft lip, and cleft\n6\npalate. Take 100 mg daily until birth, followed by only 50 mg daily. This is because an excess of B\n6\nafter delivery can hinder the amount of mother's milk produced.\nFolic acid prevents anemia and birth defects. It is involved in cell growth and DNA production. But it is\nvital that this supplementation be started prior to conception. Take 400 mg daily. If there is not enough\nfolic acid in the system during the first six weeks of pregnancy, spina bifida and anencephaly can result.\nBut most women do not know they are pregnant until several weeks after conception has occurred.\nTherefore it is crucial that you be taking this vitamin regularly.\nVitamin C prevents infections and small babies.\nVitamin D works with calcium, to build strong bones.\nAll the vitamins are very important, but so are the minerals.\nMagnesium helps prevent birth abnormalities and miscarriage.\nCalcium prevents weak bones and teeth, premature births, and damaged nerves.\nAlthough phosphorous is important you always get enough in your food. Too much blocks iron and\ncalcium absorption. Soft drinks eliminate calcium. See \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\nThe trace minerals are also important. Nova Scotia dulse and Norwegian kelp are good sources.\nIodine prevents thyroid problems, abnormal development, and certain types of mental retardation.\nZinc prevents dwarfism and limb defects.\nManganese prevents certain brain abnormalities.\nInadequate folic acid, manganese, and zinc (as well as amino acid imbalances) have been linked to\nmental retardation and deformities in the fetus.\nDo not eat junk food of any type. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, spicy, fried, or overly processed\nfoods. If possible, avoid all drugs.\nSPECIAL NOTES—If at all possible, have your baby by natural childbirth—and with the help of a\nmidwife.\nBe sure and breast-feed your baby for at least the first three months, and longer if possible. (see \"Breastfeeding.\")\nDo not use an electric blanket. Studies indicate it may increase risk of miscarriage and problems in\ndevelopment.\nAspirin has been linked to fetal deformities, bleeding, and complications during pregnancy.\nDo not use cinnamon in large quantities during pregnancy.\nThe drug, etretinate (Tegison), is prescribed for psoriasis, and can cause birth defects.\nAvoid the following herbs during pregnancy: feverfew, goldenseal, black cohosh, tansy, angelica,\nbloodroot, celandine, dong quai, Oregon grape, rue, cat's claw, barberry, cottonwood bark, and\npennyroyal.\nKeep yourself healthy, so you can continue eating an adequate diet. Avoid long fasts, cleansing diets, or\nstrictly limited diets during pregnancy and lactation (see \"Eclampsia\").\nDo not take anything containing shark cartilage during pregnancy. It reduces production of new blood\nvessels.\nDo not take supplements containing phenylalanine. This is an amino acid which can alter brain growth\nin the fetus. The sweetener, Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet), contains high levels of phenylalanine.\nA drug prescribed for acne (isotretinoin, under the trade name of Accutane) can cause birth defects.\nAvoid mineral oil; it inhibits the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.\nTwo medications, used to control seizures, increase by four times the risk of producing a baby with heart\ndefects. These drugs are phenobarbital and phenytoin (Dilantin).\nDrinking large quantities of coffee, cola drinks, or other caffeine sources can result in birth defects.\nCertain chemicals in drugs can stunt fetal growth. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and\nothers); antacids (Pepto-Bismol, Alka-Seltzer, Rolaids, Tums, Di-Gel, Maalox, Gelusil); aspirin; cough\nremedies; cold pills; antihistamines; estrogens; and decongestants.\nINDIGESTION—Eat smaller meals and chew your food well. Acidophilus, peppermint tea, ginger, and\naloe vera juice will help. Also see \"Indigestion.\" Do not take baking soda to alleviate indigestion,\nbecause the sodium content will increase fluid retention.\nANEMIA—It is important enough that you obtain enough iron, so you can avoid simple anemia.\nNatural iron herbal formulas, which include yellow dock and dandelion, will build up the blood.\nChlorophyll, kelp, dulse, rice bran, whole grains, beans, dried apricots, and green leafy vegetables are\nother sources. But the very best source of iron is blackstrap molasses.\nYou should be aware of the fact that bottled iron supplement tablets frequently have the wrong kind of\niron in them. Because it is not natural, it can block the absorption of vitamins E and A. Vitamin E is the\nantiabortion vitamin, and is needed in order to bring a baby to full term. Also see \"Anemia.\"\nCONSTIPATION—Constipation can lead to high blood pressure, water retention, toxemia (toxic\nblood), and injure both the mother and baby. It can also produce leg cramps, backache fatigue, and\nvaricose veins. Also see \"Constipation.\"\nBACKACHE—The increase in weight and shift in center of gravity can cause problems if the mother\ndoes not maintain proper posture and avoid fatigue. The hormone, progesterone, tends to relax the\nmuscles.\nDo not wear high-heeled shoes, and do not stay in one position too long (see \"Backache\").\nDIZZINESS—Especially during the second trimester, blood pressure drops as the uterus presses on\nmajor blood vessels.\nDo not arise or change positions quickly. Breathe deeper when you sense that you need to do so.\nBLEEDING GUMS—The gums tend to swell and become softer because of increased estrogen output.\nGive your teeth and gums special care, lest bleeding and infection occur.\nGAS—Flatulence will tend to occur more frequently during pregnancy than normally. Try to determine\nwhich foods are causing the problem. Make sure you are obtaining enough fresh fruit and vegetables.\n(Also see \"Bloating.\")\nMOOD CHANGES—Hormonal changes, stress, and nutritional needs affect this. Be sure and obtain\nenough B complex vitamins. Know that mood changes during pregnancy are normal and generally\ntemporary.\nFREQUENT URINATION—Changes in kidney function and uterine expansion frequently cause this.\nBut do not reduce intake of liquids, thinking this will solve the problem!\nGROIN PRESSURE—Ligaments near the uterus can kink and spasm, causing a \"stitch\" on the right\nside. In later pregnancy, more direct pressure on the groin area can occur.\nDuring a spasm, breathe deeply and bend toward the point of pain. Lay down and rest until the pain\nleaves. Be sure and maintain adequate daily exercises.\nINSOMNIA—This is especially likely during the final weeks of pregnancy. At this time, it is more\ndifficult to sleep comfortably.\nDo not sleep until you feel like doing so. Include more B complex vitamins in your diet. (Also see\n\"Insomnia.\")\nHEARTBURN—The expanding uterus presses on the stomach and causes fluids to push back up into\nthe esophagus.\nDo not eat fried, greasy, spicy foods. Avoid baking soda, coffee, alcohol, and antacids.\nDo not bend over or lay flat for several hours after a meal.\nWhile in bed, place pillows under or behind your abdomen. (Also see \"Heartburn.\")\nVARICOSE VEINS—These will usually disappear after childbirth. Walk a mile a day, to increase\ncirculation. Change positions frequently, and never cross your legs. Sit with feet elevated. If necessary,\nwear support hose. Do not wear bands on the legs (see \"Varicose Veins\").\nHEMORRHOIDS—Constipation and uterine pressure can induce formation of these. Drink more\nwater. Increase intake of roughage, to soften stools. Keep legs elevated on a stool while eliminating.\nApply cold witch hazel compresses to help shrink them. (Also see \"Hemorrhoids.\")\nSTRETCH MARKS—These are strips (often wave-like) which appear on the abdomen, breasts,\nbuttocks, and thighs. They are pressure marks and do not totally leave, but after childbirth can become\ndifficult to see.\nApply oil, once a day, all over the areas where the marks are likely to appear. The formula includes ½\ncup of olive oil, ¼ cup of aloe vera gel, 6 capsules of vitamin E, and 4 capsules of vitamin A. Cut open\nthe capsules, mix it all together, and apply.\nLEG CRAMPS—Extra weight on the legs, nutritional deficiencies, and too much salt in the diet can\ncause this.\nElevate the legs while sleeping, so they are higher than your heart. Do not stand in one place too long.\nFlex your feet every so often. Take adequate calcium and potassium. Apply a heating pad to the\ncramping area.\nENCOURAGEMENT—With the eye of faith, with child-like submission, trust your life to God, and\nHe will wonderfully guide you. His promise is, \"I will instruct and teach you.\"",

Morning sickness is\ncaused by rising progesterone levels, and is quite normal.\nMorning sickness is said to be a cleansing of the body, to prepare a clean environment in which the fetus\ncan properly develop.\nBut about 1 woman in 200 experiences an abnormal amount of vomiting and severe nausea. This can\nresult in acidosis, malnutrition, dehydration, and significant weight loss.\nPossible causes of this abnormal condition include drug toxicity, vitamin deficiency (especially of B ),\n6\npancreatitis, bile duct disease, inflammatory bowel disorders.\nIt can also be caused by the production of high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, which is a\nhormone. Cysts in the uterus or multiple pregnancy can be the cause.\nMorning sickness generally does not continue beyond the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. If there is\npersistent vomiting or nausea later, consult with your health-care provider.\nAt its worst, morning sickness can degenerate into hyperemesis gravidarum. In this situation, the motherto-be has far too much vomiting and nausea; is overly dehydrated; not urinating properly; and cannot\nkeep food, water, and juice down for over a period of 4-6 hours.\nThis condition can lead to pulse irregularities, electrolyte imbalance, and even kidney and liver damage.\nKetones produced, when stored fat is broken down, can damage neurological development in the fetus.\nHow to avoid this danger?

This will relieve\nmuch of the nausea.\n- Keep crackers or whole-wheat toast near your bed and eat some as soon as you arise in\nthe morning. Pop them in your mouth, chew well, and swallow; then place your feet on\nthe floor.\n- It helps to keep some food in the stomach all day long. Eat small and frequent meals, but\ndo not overeat. When needed, snack on whole-grain crackers, possibly with a little nut\nbutter (but not peanut butter).\n- Another method is to carry some raw almonds with you, wherever you go. Make sure\nthey are not old and stale.\n- Do not go without food or drink even though you feel nauseated and may vomit. You\nmust continue to have both!\n- Vitamin B and the entire B complex is important. Essential fatty acids and a complete\n6\nline of nutritional supplements should be taken.\n- Drink lots of fluids: water, fruit or vegetable juice, broth, or certain herbal teas.\n- Avoid fried and fatty foods.\n- Helpful herbs include dogwood, catnip, dandelion, mint, peppermint, and red raspberry\nleaf.

Give it either orally or intramuscularly).\nTO STOP AFTER-BIRTH PAINS—Wild yam, cramp bark, and black haw are specific herbs which\nhelp reduce after-birth pains and cramping throughout the pelvic area. Hot fomentations over the area,\nafter a warming liniment has been rubbed into the skin, is useful.\nWarm whole baths help the pain subside. Make sure the bathtub is sterile beforehand.\nFast on vegetable juices and broths until the pains are gone.\nOnce the pain is relieved, apply a castor oil pack for an hour.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Let God's Word, the Bible, be a lamp to your feet and a light to your path.

The convulsions begin with\nfixation of the eyeballs, rolling of the eyes, twitchings of the face, arms, and hands. Then coma with\ntemperature at 103o-104o F. The person can die in the coma.\nCAUSES—Beginning about the turn of the century, physicians have sometimes prescribed women to\nkeep their weight down in order to have smaller babies (which are easier for the doctor to deliver).\nBut such arbitrarily restricted diets—low in protein, salt, and water—can lead to serious consequences.\nThe sudden weight gain occurs because of fluid retention, due to low blood protein, high blood pressure,\nand albuminuria.\nIf pre-eclampsia is not treated properly, then it develops into eclampsia—an even worse form of the\ndisorder.\nBoth forms of this disorder occur after the 20th week of pregnancy.

      "overview": "- A balanced high-protein diet. Do not restrict salt. Take seaweed products for trace\nminerals, also a full vitamin/mineral supplement. (See \"Pregnancy-related Problems\" for a\ndetailed list of nutritional needs.)\n- Take B (100 mg daily until birth, then only 50 mg daily) and 10-12 glasses of water or\n6\nfruit juice a day, especially in the hot months.\nENCOURAGEMENT—The old song says, \"Trust and obey, for there is no other way, to be happy in\nJesus, but to trust and obey.\" And how very true that is.\nBREAST-FEEDING; INFANT FEEDING (Lactation; Nursing)\nTOPIC—Helpful suggestions on nursing your child. Try to nurse him for 9 months, if at all possible.\nNUTRITION—Breast-fed babies are less susceptible to SIDS. In addition, they have less allergies,\nrespiratory diseases, hypoglycemia, obesity, and gastroenteritis. In addition, both mother and child are\nhappier and bond together better. The infant has better health and adapts much better to later physical\nand emotional situations which develop.\nA high-calcium diet is very important in maintaining a good milk supply. (See \"Bones, Strengthening\"\nfor lots of information on obtaining enough calcium.) Be sure and get enough sunshine for vitamin D.\nA high-protein diet is also very important. Take B complex, plus all the other vitamins and minerals,\nalong with a sizeable amount of brewer's yeast at every meal. You tend to have to stuff yourself on yeast\nand calcium foods in order to have enough milk for your baby.\nKeep yourself healthy, so you can continue eating an adequate diet. Avoid long fasts, cleansing diets, or\nstrictly limited diets during lactation.\nKeep your bowels open, and clean with high-fiber foods.\nDrink lots of lemon juice.\nAvoid sage tea, for it dries up the milk.\nAvoid mental depression, violent exercise, beans, onions, and cabbage. They upset the baby.\nDo not smoke while nursing! Avoid caffeine, liquor, junk food, fried food, and drugs.\nBe happy, rest often, and pray that God will help you raise a child who is dedicated to Him.\nTo increase milk supply, helpful herbs include milkweed, caraway, goat's rue, and fenugreek.\nTo reduce milk supply (or the pain of breast engorgement), the herb, goldenrod, is helpful.\nFor sore nipples, use sunshine or the light of a light bulb close enough to feel warm but not burn.\nFrom the beginning, give the baby a little water, gradually increasing the amount. Give tomato juice,\nstarting with a half teaspoonful at about the age of one month. At 3 months, begin a little blended food.\nBy 9 months, the baby should be eating a variety of carefully prepared natural foods.\nWhen the baby is six months old, dilute 4 teaspoons of whole-wheat flakes in boiling water till entirely\ndissolved, put through a fine sieve, and add to the baby's bottle (if you are giving him a bottle by then).\nA little powdered oatmeal can also be added.\nWhen the first teeth appear, begin feeding wholesome simple foods in puree form, such as greens,\nvegetables, fruit juices, and gruels.\nDo not give the infant cane sugar in any form. This can lead to fever and various ailments. Use malt\nsugar. Do not give infants honey or orange juice.\nDo not give the infant meat!\nFeeding an infant meat, cane sugar, white-flour products, candies, or soft drinks causes him to lose his\ntaste for simple, natural foods; and is responsible for rickets, scurvy, tonsil trouble, night terrors, anemia,\nand convulsions.\nBREAST-FEEDING—There are certain principles which, if followed, will avoid sore, fissured, and\npossibly infected nipples.\nTry to wash your hands before handling your breasts.\nPosition the baby properly. His entire body should face you. His buttocks should be in one hand, and his\nhead in the bend of your elbow.\nThe other hand is under the breast, with all four fingers supporting it. But do not place your fingers on\nthe areola (the darker area around the nipple).\n(If—if—your hands are clean, you can rub the nipple lightly to firm it. Pinching it lightly flattens the\nnipple, to fit his mouth better.)\nDo not try to toughen your nipples by vigorously rubbing them. This can damage them.\nAs you tickle the baby's lower lip with your nipple, his mouth will open wide. When it is open wide, pull\nhis body in quickly. His mouth should fix on the areola, and the nipple should be deep in his throat. At\nleast an inch of the areola should be in his mouth. In this way, there is no movement of the nipple as the\ninfant sucks.\nIf you feel pain, do not delay, but immediately use your finger to break the suction and reposition him.\nPlace a finger inside the corner of the infant's mouth to allow air to enter and break the vacuum.\nLa Leche says that 95% of the nipple soreness problems are caused by the way the baby sucks, and can\nbe corrected.\nLeave him on a breast as long as he is sucking effectively (swallowing every suck or two). If he begins\npausing, burp him, wake him, switch sides, and let him nurse as long as he wants. Feeding time is\nusually 20-30 minutes.\n(But, for the first few days, it may be necessary to limit feeding periods to 5 minutes on each breast,\nbefore rotating to the other. It is very important that you work with the baby properly, so that you avoid\nfissures developing on, or near, the nipple.)\nDo not let him remain on the breast after he has finished actively feeding. (See \"Mastitis\" for reasons for\nmany of these precautions.)\nThe next time you start, begin on the breast you ended with previously. Always have him nurse on both\nsides.\nYou will find that the baby will want to nurse often—frequently 8-12 times a day in the early weeks.\nGod designed that these frequent feedings would bond the infant to his mother.\nBreak the suction of the infant's mouth on the breast by inserting a finger into the corner of his mouth,\nnot just pulling the nipple out of his mouth.\nAfter feeding, empty the breasts manually or with a breast pump until supply and demand reach an\nequilibrium.\nAir-dry the breasts after each feeding, before covering them. (Exposing the breasts to the air for 20\nminutes at a time, two or three times a day, is helpful.) A 40-watt bulb can be placed near them for 15\nminutes at a time. Never use breast pads that might retain moisture (especially those with plastic in\nthem). Do not wear bras with plastic liners. If needed, place a folded handkerchief there.\nNipple cleanliness is important, but never use soap on the nipples; it dries them out. The milk contains\nits own oil and also a self-cleaning antiseptic. Leave a little on at the end of each feeding, to lubricate\nand soften the nipple.\nBaby saliva contains an enzyme which softens the skin. So, if possible, wash the nipples with clean\nwater. (Water or alcohol applied to the nipple will toughen the skin and assist in preventing sore\nnipples.) Or, better yet, place some mother's milk on them.\nIf a nipple becomes sore, put a little milk on it. The nipples should be checked daily; and, if they are sore\nor cracked, treatment should begin promptly; do not wait. (See \"Mastitis.\")\nClothing worn next to the breast should always be soft and non-irritating. Cotton is generally best.\nAvoid plugged ducts. Binding clothes, fatigue, or prolonged periods without nursing can cause them. If\nnot dealt with promptly, infection can begin. A place on the breast will feel hard and painful to the\ntouch. Get rid of it by massaging the breast, starting at the chest wall and working down with a circular\nmotion. It is important that you let the baby nurse on that side frequently. The sucking clears out the duct\nbetter than anything else, generally within 24 hours.\nFeed the baby before the breasts become too full; the infant has difficulty grasping the breast. Stasis of\nmilk (when it is not flowing on out, but remaining in the breast too long) helps lead to mastitis.\nIf the baby is fed before he is hungry, he will not suck the nipple too vigorously. Never allow him to\nchew the nipple.\nIf the nipples become sore, place some cold grocery-store tea (containing tannic acid) on a folded tissue\nand lay it on the area for 20 minutes; then dry and expose it to air for 20 minutes. Rinse it before the\nnext nursing. The tannic acid will promote healing.\nPoultices of comfrey root or leaf may be used for sore nipples.\nIf a nipple is cracked, pierce a vitamin E capsule and apply the oil just after nursing. Do not use very\nmuch.\nIf the baby is not taking as much milk as you are producing, and you are getting too full, apply hot, wet,\ncompresses to the breast. This will open up the ducts and increases the flow. Then nurse the baby more\noften and longer. Drink more fluids, so you can urinate every hour.\n—Also see \"Mastitis.\" That article will also explain prebirth preparation of the nipples.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Only the love that flows from the heart of Christ can heal. Only He can restore\nthe wounded soul. Submit your life to Him every day and obey His Written Word, and you will find the\nhelp you need.",

Keep\nnursing; you will recover more quickly and the baby will not be injured.\n- Obtain plenty of rest, including frequent rest periods throughout the day.\nPREVENTION—The article, \"Breast-feeding,\" contains many important points.\nPrevention of mastitis begins prior to childbirth. For 2-3 months, the mother-to-be must get her nipples\nready for lactation. She should massage the nipples daily with chickweed ointment. Vitamin E may also\nbe used. Perform the \"nipple pull\" several times each day during a shower.\nDuring breast-feeding, position the baby right. Place the baby on breast correctly, emptying the breast\nfully, and break suction properly. This should be followed by emptying the breast with a hand pump, if\nnecessary. Nipple cleanliness is also important. Proper clothing should be worn. All this and more is\nexplained in \"Breast-feeding.\"\n— Also see \"Fibrocystic Breast Disease.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care. Go to God with\nyour trials and problems, and find in Him the solutions you so much seek.\nSection 14\nBirth and Children\nPart 3\nBirth Defects",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—A variety of partially, or wholly, incapacitating physical or mental defects which are\npresent at birth.\nCAUSES—More than 90% of birth defects are the result of preconception and early pregnancy\nmalnutrition of the mother. Such defects include cleft palates, cleft lips, heart defects, limb defects, spina\nbifida, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart defects, brain defect, fetal hernia.\nAll of the above diseases have been eliminated from valuable livestock by the veterinary profession.\nThey have done this by giving the animals excellent nutrition.\nIt is well-known that bearing a child after the age of 40 can cause problems. But teenagers have a greater\npercentage of children with birth defects than do women over 40, because of their general poor eating\nhabits and lack of vitamin/mineral supplementation. Many young people today live on junk food and\nhave damaged offspring as a result.\nAs an example, let us consider cystic fibrosis; it is a type of adrenal damage). It is classified as the \"most\ncommon genetic defect\"; yet, in reality, cystic fibrosis is a selenium and fatty acid deficiency in the fetus\nand/or newborn breast-fed infant. If the mother has celiac disease, this can impede her absorption of\nessential nutrients, especially selenium, even more.\nIn 1958, Dr. Kaus Schwartz reported in the NIH publication, Federal Proceedings, that selenium was an\nessential nutrient. The deficiency symptoms he reported all fit cystic fibrosis. But no one paid attention.\nIn 1972, Cornell University found that chicks hatched from selenium deficient hens developed all the\nclassical symptoms of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. But they too did not connect the finding to\nselenium.\nBut they also discovered that, if selenium was given to the chicks within 30 days after hatching, they\nwere totally cured within 21 days.\nIn 1978, J.D. Wallach, a veterinarian researcher, identified this problem in animals and birds as being\n\"cystic fibrosis.\" But, when other researchers agreed with his findings, Wallach was fired within 24\nhours from his government research laboratory.\nSince that date, Wallach has treated over 450 CF patients with excellent results. He has cured threemonth-old infants of the disorder. Wallach later did joint research with the Chinese Government in their\nhospitals, and helped thousands of their people.\nYet, in America, the people are told CF is a \"genetic defect\" and nothing can be done, except expensive\nand time-consuming rehabilitation programs.\nDr. Arthur F. Coco, inventor of the pulse test, made this statement:\n\"I am a realist. As long as the profit is in the treatment of symptoms rather than a search for causes,\nthat's where the medical profession will go for its harvest.\"\nIt is true that radiation is another cause of birth defects, yet only .1% of birth defects result from X rays,\netc. Most pregnant women realize that they should avoid them.\nWhat is the solution to the problem? It is to give women a good nourishing diet. But it must begin a\ncouple years before conception!\nPrevention of birth defects requires more than \"prenatal\" vitamins after the second month of pregnancy,\nwhen the physician gives his pronouncement, \"You are pregnant.\" By that time, the embryo has formed\nall organs and tissues—for better or worse! Proper supplementation of vitamins and minerals, nourishing\nfood, and avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, drugs, and junk food must have had its effect on the\nmother's body—before conception took place!\nDo a home pregnancy test as soon as you suspicion the possibility, and immediately begin eating\nnourishing food and taking supplements.\n—A sample of such a birth defect is \"Cerebral Palsy.\" Also see \"Cystic Fibrosis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Faith is needed in the world today, faith that will lay hold on the promises of\nGod's Word and refuse to let go until Heaven hears.",

Keeping an eye on him, leave\nhim that way for as long as practicable. But if you do not watch him, you will regret the\nresults.\n- Keep the child bare and exposed to air and sunlight as much as the climate will permit.\n- Change the diaper frequently; wash the area with cool water and gently dab dry, using a\nsoft cotton diaper.\n- (Use corn starch as a drying agent; never use talcum powder! It is a powdered rock dust,\nand can cause cancer in anyone (infant or adult) that uses it.)\n- Expose the infant to small daily doses of sunlight or ultraviolet light. Be careful not to\nburn him. No ocean bathing until the rash is gone. But fresh pool water or rainwater is\nokay.\n- The new super-absorbent diapers greatly help solve the problem. They reduce skin\nwetness.\n- Try blow-drying the baby before rediapering him.\n- Adding vinegar to the final rinse when washing diapers will help reduce the pH of the\ncloth. Add 1 ounce of vinegar to 1 gallon of water during the final rinse.\n- Giving 2-3 ounces of cranberry juice to older infants will make urine pH slightly more\nacid.

Or thick, yellow, greasy crusts. Sometimes it spreads to the\neyelids, external ear canal, and nose.\nCAUSES—Cradle cap is the most common scalp disorder of infants. About 50% have it at some time.\nThere is an overproduction of sebum, a waxy oil substance that may plug the sebaceous glands, leading\nto inflammation and acne formation. The entire scalp can become covered with a thick mat of sebum\nand dead skin cells.\nPossible causes include food allergies. Of 187 infants which had it, in later years 67% later had an\nallergy (whereas 20% have allergies in the general population).\nThe problem most frequently develops within the first 3 months and usually 3-4 weeks after introduction\nof a new food. When that food was withdrawn, cradle cap cleared up. Most likely to cause problems:\nmilk, wheat, eggs, oranges, beans, peas, and sometimes oatmeal.\nA deficiency of vitamin B and zinc may be involved.\n6",

A catnip tea enema will\nalso help. Crying spells occur at regular intervals; so, if a very warm bath is given an hour\nbefore an expected attack, it may be prevented. Have catnip tea on hand to use in an\nemergency.\n- In addition, a hot footbath or hot fomentation over the abdomen will relieve the baby.\n- If the baby is totally breast-fed, the cause is in the mother's diet. Any food the mother\nmay eat may, through her milk, causes the baby to suffer infant colic; onions, cabbage,\ngarlic, wheat, yeast, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are common offenders. Another major\ncause is fried food, junk food, refined food, and all types of confused food combinations.\nBoth the mother and the child need a good diet.\n- Colic in a formula-fed infant points to the food given to the child. It may be the milk,\nwheat, soy, or sugar in the formula. If possible, substitute vitamin-enriched goat's milk.\nAlso try to have the mother begin breast-feeding the baby. Even if she did not begin doing\nit after delivery, she can, with some effort, get the flow started later. This is done by\nfrequent attempts to feed the baby over several months.\n- If the infant is bottle-fed, for added nourishment at this time you might pour boiling\nwater over wheat flakes, to dissolve them; put them through a sieve; and add soybean\nmilk, to bring it to a desired consistency. Potassium broth and oatmeal gruel are also\nhelpful.\n- If colic develops after weaning has begun, the new food is the problem. The infant must\nbe given proper foods and only one new food should be added at a time, so the infant can\nbe carefully monitored for colic, rashes, or other reactions.\n- Wheat and dairy products are especially suspect. When in doubt, eliminate them first.\nWheat and other grains are often introduced far too early. But this can cause the child to\nlater develop celiac disease, which will affect him throughout life (see \"Celiac Disease\").\nThe infant does not have the digestive enzymes to handle grains until 5-6 months. Let\ngrains be one of the last foods introduced, and do not give yeast bread until after a year\nold.\n- Give fresh, boiled, goat's milk; it is far less of a problem.\n- Keep diet diaries and do pulse testing, to ascertain offending foods (see \"Pulse Test\").\n- It may help to give pancreatic enzymes (75-200 mg three times a day) before meals\n(enzymes may be constipating), flaxseed oil (1-2 drops) after each meal, and vitamin B\n6\n(10 mg twice a day).\n—Also see \"Colic in Children.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Speak words of hope and good cheer, and you will encourage all about you in\nthe pathway of life.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—The infant suddenly dies.\nCAUSES—There is no advance warning or symptom. That is what it is called \"sudden infant death\nsyndrome.\" The central nervous system is affected, which in turn suppresses the involuntary act of\nbreathing.\nEach year, in the United States, there are 10,000 deaths from this problem. SIDS primarily occurs in the\nwinter, primarily to underweight babies from poor families, and the mothers are generally under 20.\nSeveral possible causes have been traced:\nThere may be high blood levels of the toxic mineral, lead. It has been reported that there are high levels\nof lead in infants who die of SIDS.\nSuffocation may be the cause. It has been found that infants who were laid on their stomachs, to go to\nsleep, are much more likely to suddenly die than infants who are laid on their backs.\nBreast-fed babies are less susceptible to SIDS. In addition, they have less allergies, respiratory diseases,\nhypoglycemia, obesity, and gastroenteritis.\nIt is now known that SIDS can be caused by the pertussis vaccine, which is given to infants at 2, 4, and 6\nmonths of age.",

If the infant is breast-fed, the\nmother's diet should be excellent; if the baby is bottle-fed, then, if possible, fresh boiled\ngoat's milk should be used. Mothers should nurse their babies, if at all possible.\n- Locate allergenic foods and eliminate them.\n- The mother should avoid chemicals, drugs, and junk food during and after pregnancy.\nEven aspirin is not good (it interferes with blood clotting, and could damage the fetus).\n- Do not use caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco; they harm the unborn child, so it does not\ndevelop properly.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Heaven is very near to those who suffer for righteousness' sake.

They also tend to urinate more frequently during the day.\nHere are the frequency statistics: 50% wet by the age of 2; 10-15% by 4; 4% at 12. Boys do it more\nfrequently than girls, but girls can develop urinary tract infections from it.\nA primary cause of bed-wetting is allergy. Their parents are more likely to have hives, hay fever, urinary\ntract infection, food allergies, or drug allergies.\nFood allergies in the children are responsible for many cases. The most frequent problem foods were\ncow's milk (60% of the time), chocolate, eggs, citrus fruits, wheat, grains, corn, chicken, meat, peanuts,\nand fish. You would need to do pulse tests, to determine the problem food (see \"Pulse Test\").\nHyperactive children tend to be bed wetters.\nConstipation may at times be involved, by pressing on the bladder.\nSome children, especially older ones, continue to wet the bed because of tensions they live under in the\nhome or at school.\nRemoving milk from the diet reduced bed wetting in 50% of a group being studied.\nAnemia, pinworms, upper respiratory tract infections, or any toxic condition can be contributing factors.",

This causes him to acquire better mental control of the function. This may solve\nthe problem in as little as six weeks.\n- Spanking the child is not the solution! Do not praise and do not punish. The child does\nnot do it on purpose, and he is sorry. Just change the bed and do not say a word. —But\nkeep working on possible solutions listed here. No child wants to do it.\n- The child should be encouraged to have vigorous outdoor exercise. (It is known that bed\nwetters wet less during the summer months, and some who have stopped may return to it\nin the winter.)\n- In children over 10, limit the amount of fluid intake after 5 p.m. at night, until several\nmonths after bed-wetting ceases.\n- Bed-wetting alarms can be purchased.

The result is an infected ring.\nItching, burning, or pain may be present. The lesions appear to be circular. The area is often covered\nwith small blisters.\nWhen the scalp is affected, the hair falls out in circular patches. The fingers can also be affected.\nCAUSES—Ringworm is a very contagious disease, caused by a parasitic fungus. It can infect children\nor adults, and is caused by unsanitary conditions. Keep the hands clean! Pet the dog and then rub your\nface, and you may regret it.\nRingworm of the beard (face) is more persistent than ringworm of the scalp. Ringworm of the body is\nthe easiest to eliminate.\nDogs, cats, rabbits, children, and contaminated clothing are generally the carriers of the disease.\nThere are several different types of ringworm, all of which are of fungal origin:\nRingworm of the scalp - This can be on the scalp, face, and on the nails, is the most noticeable kind. It is\nhighly contagious, and often found on school-children. It frequently induces baldness, which may\nbecome permanent if hair shafts are destroyed by the fungus.\nRingworm of the trunk - This includes “jockey itch,” and is spread by contact with people or their\nclothing. Dogs and cats can also spread it.\nRingworm of the nails - This consists of a fungus growing under the nails. It produces thickened,\nmisshapen, brittle, discolored, chalky, pitted, or grooved nails. The nails can either be on the hands or\nthe feet. This type of ringworm is quite difficult to eliminate.\nRingworm of the feet - This is also known as athlete's foot (see \"Athlete's Foot\").",

This can be sunlight, or a\nsunlamp. Never place a sunlamp closer than 18 inches from the skin.\n- Apply apple cider vinegar to the area several times a day.\n- Equally useful is castor oil, goldenseal tea, and borax. Rub the area with borax and with\ncastor oil.\n- A 3-day citrus fast is very helpful, cleansing the bowels daily. Follow this with a\nnutritious diet.\n- Eat plenty of garlic. Put raw garlic over the ringworm and cover. You can also use black\nwalnut extract. Wash the area with garlic juice or wormwood.\n- Place freshly cut garlic 3 times a day on the area. This is a very good remedy. Blend the\ngarlic with a little water and apply as a soak, compress, or poultice. But this remedy is too\npowerful to apply to raw flesh between the toes; it can burn lower layers of skin.\n- Take 2 chaparral or wormwood capsules daily.\n- The scalp can be shampooed with tar soap and borax. Moisten the area every morning\nand evening with goldenseal (1 teaspoon) and myrrh (½ teaspoon), which has been\nsteeped in a pint of boiling water.\n- An herb tea can also be taken internally: goldenseal or plantain, twice a day.\n- Make a salve from equal parts of burdock root, chaparral, wormwood, and chickweed;\napply to the area. Some of it can also be made into a tea to drink in order to fight the\nfungus internally.\n- Keep the skin clean and dry. Ringworm likes damp skin. Take frequent baths, but dry\nthoroughly each time. Rub briskly with a towel, to remove the outer dead layers of skin\nthat the ringworm initially attacks.\n- Do not scratch. Keep fingernails cut short, to lessen accidental scratching and spreading\nof the infection.\n- To remove crusts, soak the area in a saline solution. An alternate method is to apply\nmoist cloths for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day.\n- To treat nails: Pare and scrape the infected area, and try to remove as much of the loose\nmaterial beneath the nails. Apply vinegar with a Q-tip twice a day. Keep at it, even though\nit may require months to eliminate. Fungus of the nails is the slowest to conquer.\n—Also see \"Athlete's Foot,\" which is a type of ringworm fungus.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Nothing of the world can make you sad, when you have submitted your heart\nto be molded by the Spirit of Christ.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Inflammation and possible infection of the tonsils and the adenoids. If streptococcal\nbacteria have caused the infection, it is called strep throat. There is a sore throat with fever, lack of\nappetite, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, nasal obstruction and discharge. The lymph\nglands may become swollen. Symptoms continue for 24-72 hours, and then gradually subside over 7-10\ndays. The tonsils may look red and enlarged, and pus may be observed.\nCAUSES—The tonsils and adenoids are glands containing lymphatic tissue, located in the upper throat.\nBoth are part of the immune system; they protect the body, at the top of the gastrointestinal tract, against\ninfection. Each tonsil contains 200 million lymphocytes. We will here primarily deal with tonsillitis;\ntreatment for adenitis is essentially the same. Strep throat also has the same treatment.\nWhen the body's resistance is lowered, viruses or bacteria (usually streptococcal) set to work. And a diet\nof processed and junk food, that is high in carbohydrates and low in protein, can also bring on this\ncondition.\nIf streptococcal infection (strep throat) is not present, then the throat condition is eliminated much\nquicker.\nIf not cared for properly, strep throat can be potentially dangerous and can lead to rheumatic fever or\nmeningitis.\nFood allergies weaken the body: usually cow's milk, chocolate, or too much white-flour or sugar\nproducts. Cow's milk or wheat are the two primary allergens to beware of.\nAntibiotics weaken the body more.\nThe more frequently this infection occurs, the more difficult it is to eliminate. The tonsils become\nscarred from previous inflammations.\nQuinsy is peritonsillar abscess. It is an infection of the tonsil, between the tonsil and the pharyngeal\nconstrictor muscle. The solution is not a tonsillectomy, but the care specified below.",

The eruptions continue in cycles from 3-7 days, and the disease generally runs its course\nin 14 days. It is communicable 1-2 days before the rash develops, until all the blister-like lesions have\ncrusted (averaging 5-6 days).\nChickenpox mainly occurs between 2 and 8 years of age, and is much more severe if not contracted until\none is an adult. If a pregnant mother has it in the first four months of pregnancy, birth defects are\npossible in the infant. Once you have had it, you generally have lifetime immunity. This is why\nchickenpox vaccines are dangerous. It is better to get the disease as a child when it is relatively harmless\nthan to wait till adulthood to contract it.\nOddly enough, the same virus that causes chickenpox in children (varicella zoster) is the one which\ncauses shingles (which see) in adults.\nChickenpox is transmitted by contact and by airborne droplets.

Bathe him often.\n- Relieve itching with calamine lotion, moist baking soda, or starch baths.

Do not let him become chilled.\n- Each day, give a tepid bath, followed by a change of clothes and linens. Protect against\nchilling while bathing and other times. Chickenpox pneumonia can develop!\n- Oatmeal baths are soothing, because they are alkaline. Put 1 pound of uncooked oatmeal\n(or 1 heaping cup of uncooked rolled oats, ground fine, in a blender) in a bag made of 2\nthicknesses of old sheeting. Soften it with hot water and then float it in the bathtub or hang\nit, so the faucet will flow through it. You can use the bag to gently sponge the body. Pat\ndry when finished; do not rub.\n- If needed, mix 1 level teaspoon of salt with 1 pint (2 cups) of water, and gargle with it.\n- Avoid constipation.\n- If you contract chickenpox as an adult, go on a fasting program of fruit and vegetable\njuices, interspersed with light meals.\n- Keep the infected child away from newborn infants, elderly people, and pregnant\nwomen. They may not have had chickenpox before.\n- Do not send the child back to school until all lesions have finished being crusted.\n- Antibiotics and corticosteroids do not help in any way, and should not be given.\n- Do not give aspirin! About 10% of Reye's syndrome (which see) cases occur after\nchickenpox, as a result of aspirin dosages. Reye's can cause irreversible coma or death.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Guard against the tendency to forget God. You dare not do this. He is the only\none who can give you the help you need every day.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Swelling of one or both salivary glands, fever (up to 104o F.), chills, headache, sore\nthroat, and pain when swallowing or chewing. Swelling often occurs in one gland first, and then begins\nin the other as swelling in the first subsides. But it may occur on only one side.\nCAUSES—Mumps is an infection of the salivary (parotid) glands, located in front of, and below, each\near. It rarely occurs before 3 years of age or after 40. Either direct contact or droplets spread the disease.\nMumps is not as contagious as chickenpox or measles. But a person with the disease is still contagious\nfrom 48 hours, before symptoms develop, to 6 days afterward. Incubation is 14 to 21 days.\nOne bout and lifetime immunity generally follows.\nIf it is acquired after puberty, the ovaries or testes may become involved and sterility may result. Other\ncomplications can also occur, which affect the heart, kidneys, and brain.\nIf no complications occur, complete recovery generally occurs within about 10 days.\nSwollen salivary glands can be caused by several other diseases: A partial list includes cirrhosis of the\nliver, leukemia, lupus, and tuberculosis (all of which are dealt with in this book). It also includes strep\nthroat and the taking of certain drugs. If it is an isolated case of \"mumps,\" it might actually be something\nelse.",

      "overview": "- Follow treatment specified for common measles (see \"Measles\").\nWhat precautions should a woman take?\n- A pregnant woman must avoid exposure to German measles. The disease should be\nconsidered contagious from 1 week before the rash appears until 1 week after the rash\nfades.\n- If she thinks she has been exposed to the disease, she can immediately see a physician\nand request that she be given a gamma-globulin injection. If given soon after exposure, it\nmay reduce the severity of the disease or possibly prevent it from occurring.\n- Immunity to German measles can be determined by a special blood test. She may wish to\nbe vaccinated. If this is done, pregnancy must be avoided for 3 months following\nimmunization.\n- Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death! (See \"Reye's\nSyndrome.\")\n—Also see \"Measles\" and \"Childhood Diseases.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—God has given, in the Bible, sufficient evidence that it is from Him. Study and\nobey it, and God will guide you day by day as you pray for help.\nSCARLET FEVER—1 (Scarlatina)\nSYMPTOMS—Symptoms appear 2-7 days after exposure. Vomiting, along with sore throat and\nheadache. Within a day, high fever develops. Throat membrane is inflamed, and soft palate may show a\nfine light-red rash.\nThe tongue is coated white, but on the second day reddened raised points show through, especially at the\ntip and sides.\nThe throat condition becomes more severe, with redness and enlargement of glands under lower jaw.\nThe rash usually begins on the chest within 1-2 days after the first symptoms, and later extends to other\nparts of the body and limbs. But infection can occur without a rash occurring.\nCAUSES—Scarlet fever is an acute contagious disease and is caused by one of several different\nstreptococci germs. Urine and discharges from nose, mouth, ears, and any abscesses are highly\ninfectious. One attack generally brings lifelong immunity, and few contract it after the age of 15.\nThe fever usually does not remain high more than 4 days, and the rash fades within a week. The more\nintense the rash, the more scaling forms on the skin.\nInflammation of the ear is one of the most frequent complications of scarlet fever. The infection in the\nthroat passes up the Eustachian tube into the middle ear (see \"Earache and Infection\"). Children can\nbecome deaf as a result.\nThe infection may extend from the ear to the mastoid cells in the bone behind the ear, or to the\nmembranes covering the brain, or to both, producing mastoiditis (which see), brain abscess, or\nmeningitis (which see). These conditions are serious and often fatal.\nRheumatic fever (which see) frequently follows scarlet fever, and this sometimes results in inflammation\nof the lining membranes and valves of the heart.\nEnlargement of the lymph glands of the neck can turn into an abscess of these glands, as late as 5-6\nweeks after the disease began.\nIn a child well-advanced toward recovery (especially in the third week), nephritis (which see; it is a\nkidney infection) can develop. So this is another danger to be warded off by proper treatment.\nScarlet fever is not a matter to be taken lightly.\nYou do well to call a physician, if possible. He may need to lance the middle ear if infection develops.\nHe will probably examine the heart daily for indications of damage and do frequent urinalysis for signs\nof nephritis.",

There are slight chills, possible vomiting and diarrhea, always fetid\nbreath, difficulty in swallowing, and hoarseness.\nChildren first complain of feeling tired and sleepy. The tonsils appear inflamed, dark red, and unevenly\nswollen. White, parchment-like patches appear on them. The glands in the neck usually swell.\nCAUSES—Diphtheria is an acute contagious disease. It begins 3-8 days after exposure and primarily\noccurs between 1 and 10 years of age.\nPart of the danger is the obstruction to breathing, due to the above-mentioned false membrane and is\npartly due to the toxins carried by the diphtheria germs which, carried throughout the body, especially\nharm the heart muscles, nerves, and kidneys.\nThis is a serious disease. Diphtheria is transmitted by clothing, contact, domestic animals, and\nsometimes by raw milk. Anything (dish, garment, etc.) coming in contact with the person must be\ndisinfected.\nIndividuals can carry the germs on them for several years and transmit them to still others. A carrier\nshould be isolated until the germs can no longer be found in his throat, nose, or catarrhal discharge.\nIf there are no white patches or developing membrane, it is not diphtheria.\nThe membrane is tenacious and dangerous. If not checked, it will cover the air tube and the child will\nsuffocate. It is generally whitish, but may appear yellowish or greenish. When the child breathes harder\nand then has a frightened look, his air flow is narrowing.\nWhen someone develops diphtheria, there must be no delay. Give him vigorous treatment.

The diet should be liquid.\nFast on carrot juice or fresh citrus juices.\n- If the child insists on eating something, give him bananas, raisins, figs, and\noranges—and no other food. It is best to give him only liquids (water and fresh juices)\nuntil he is cleaned out, the throat is clean, and the phlegm and false membrane are totally\ngone.\n- After the disease appears to be ended, give him no meat for quite some time (better not\nto give it to him at all).\n- Give him warm baths.\n- An emetic is usually needed, to empty the stomach of putrefying matter; otherwise high\nfevers will result. Lobelia in water can be given, but combined with bayberry bark is\nbetter. The vomiting must be repeated until the stomach and throat are entirely clean.\n- As the disease progresses, lobelia and bayberry bark tea can be given at any time, to\nclean out the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Bayberry cleans the membrane\nand eliminates the odor. It is also healing and antiseptic. A very small amount of cayenne\nor ginger can be added as stimulants.\n- Problems can develop while the child is sleeping—serious ones. Therefore, always give\nhim the emetic before he goes to sleep each time. Otherwise he might suffocate in his\nsleep.\n- Give him an enema every morning and evening. This helps clean out toxins from the\ndiphtheria germs. An herb tea can be added to detoxify the colon: bayberry, white oak\nbark, or red raspberry. There should be at least 3-4 movements a day.\n- Bayberry is excellent in all throat or stomach mucous conditions.\n- If the heart rate is rapid, apply an ice bag over the heart.\n- In case of headaches, place cold compresses or ice bags to the head and neck.\n- A gargle can be made of goldenseal and myrrh, with a pinch of cayenne. Use this every\nhalf hour. It will clean the mucous and germs out of the throat.\n- Apply hot and cold fomentations over the liver, stomach, kidneys, and spine to keep the\ncirculation normal. This stimulates the lymphatic system, to help clean out toxins.\n- If there is any danger of paralysis, give hot and cold applications to the spine, stomach,\nand liver.\n- Give 2 high enemas daily.\n- If symptoms of heart failure appear, give a half teaspoon of cayenne in hot water. Have\nhim drink it all down immediately.

The eyes may be red, and the\nchild seems to have a cold in the head. There is sneezing and watering of the eyes. Then a persistent\ncough develops, especially bad at night. This coughing continues a week, and keeps getting worse—and\nis the most significant indication that the problem may be whooping cough.\nIn about 2 weeks, the typical whoop begins. At first, only 1-2 times a day, it degrades to every time there\nis coughing. It is a deep breath at the end of a series of deep coughs. The child's face may be reddish or\nbluish from the effort and lack of air. Vomiting may also occur.\nThis whooping stage lasts 3-6 weeks, and the cough may not entirely disappear for several months.\nCAUSES—Whooping cough is a contagious bacterial disease, which usually attacks children between 6\nmonths and 5 years of age. But infants and adults can also be affected. A person rarely has a second\nattack of this disease.\nThe disease is not highly contagious after the first few weeks. The most contagious phase is before a\ndefinite diagnosis is possible.\nWhooping cough occurs more frequently, and seriously, in overcrowded and unhygienic quarters and\ncold weather. In very young, delicate, or undernourished children, it is more likely to develop into\nbroncho-pneumonia—the principle cause of death in cases of whooping cough.\nComplications include convulsions, bleeding from the nose, into brain, or area around eyes. Bronchopneumonia can also occur; death only rarely.\nYou may choose to have the child vaccinated at an early age (2 months is recommended for the series).\nYou should weigh the fact that pertussis vaccine is one of the most dangerous of the shots in its\noccasional side effects.",

      "overview": "- Treat the cough—When a cough first develops, treat that cough! If you do so, the\nwhooping cough phase can be entirely prevented!\n- Wild cherry bark tea is excellent. Here are other herbs useful for coughs; select from\nthose you have on hand or can most easily obtain. They can be mixed: black cohosh,\nflaxseed, rosemary, comfrey, horehound, hyssop, myrrh, white pine, bloodroot, red sage,\nblue violet, ginseng, coltsfoot. Prepare a tea and give a teaspoonful every hour until the\ncough is better.\n- Be sure and include other worthwhile practices, such as partial or complete fasting on\nfruit and vegetable juices until the cough is past. In all kinds of coughs, first cleanse the\nsystem with high herb enemas and a herbal laxative.\n- When the cough is severe, as in whooping cough, have him drink warm water, one cup\nafter another, then stick your finger down his throat and have him vomit.\n- A light diet is essential. Overfeeding during the whooping cough prolongs the disease\nand leads to complications. In case it is a breast-fed infant, do not overfeed either. The\nchild is thirsty, not hungry.\n- As soon as it is perceived that the problem is whooping cough, place him on a full fruit\njuice fast. First, give citrus juices. This can be followed by other fruit juices; then carrot\nand other vegetable juices, and clear vegetable broth soup. Later still, fruit can be added.\n- Give vitamins A and C in large doses.\n- It is good to soak the feet in hot water, with a little mustard and salt added to it.\n- Steam inhalations are often very helpful. They can be given every 2-4 hours, according\nto the severity of the case.\n- Thick slippery elm tea is very good in whooping cough; mix in a little lemon juice and\ndrink it freely.\n- A light diet is essential.\n- Keep him isolated from other children.\n- If the weather is warm, sunny, and not too damp or dusty, keep him out of doors most of\nthe day. But he should not exert himself in play.\n- Air and sun his bedding every day, if there is sunshine.\n- Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death!

He should drink 3-8 pints of water daily.\nHELP KIDNEY ACTION—Neutral Bath daily for a half hour, followed by Cold Mitten Friction to\npromote activity of skin and kidneys.\nGENERAL METHOD—The disease can not be greatly shortened, but the strength may be maintained,\nsuffering mitigated, convalescence facilitated, and grave effects prevented by the faithful employment of\nthe above measures, which should be continued, not only during the active stage of the disease, but for\nseveral weeks after the beginning of convalescence.\n—Also see \"Whooping Cough—1.\"",

This disease affects many internal organs,\nespecially the brain and liver.\nIt primarily strikes children between the ages of 4 and 15 (but most frequently young teens), in the fall\nor winter.\nNot long ago, the death rate stood at 42%-80%, but more recently it has dropped to below 10%.\nMost cases occur after a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox. Influenza B, Epstein-Barr virus,\nand viruses which primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract (enteroviruses) can also occur prior to its\nonset.\nIt is known that giving aspirin to a child or youth who has a fever can lead to Reye's disease and the\nlikely possibility of death. In the early 1980s, it was discovered that a viral infection, plus the taking of\naspirin, dramatically increases the risk of developing Reye's syndrome.\nThe cause of the disease may be consumption of aflatoxin, which is an exotoxin of the grain mold,\naspergillus flavus.\nA biopsy generally shows liver necrosis (the liver is dying). Yet, if the person survives, there is a full\nrecovery of the liver within 12 weeks.\nIf you see the above symptoms, just after your child has come out of a viral illness—do something\nquickly! Here are the key symptoms again:\n(1) Agitation, disorientation, and delirium.\n(2) Fatigue, lethargy, and lapses in memory.\n(3) Prolonged and heavy vomiting, followed by drowsiness.\nCall a physician!

The pattern of events is this: The child\nhas a fever, and aspirin is given. There is improvement for a day or two,—then a sudden\nturn for the worst occurs, and coma or death follows. A Centers for Disease Control\n(CDC) study revealed that 96% of the children contracting Reye's syndrome had been\ngiven aspirin while they had a viral infection.

The gonorrhea is entering the bones,\njoints, tendons, and other tissues, causing mild fever, aches, inflamed joints, and sometimes skin lesions.\nIn men, the outcome can be sterility.\nAs long as 10 years later, the urethra may narrow or stricture, making urination difficult and at times\nimpossible. This produces serious inflammation of the bladder. This occurs more often in men than in\nwomen.\nWomen, who unknowingly contract gonorrhea from their husbands, generally do not know they have the\ndisease until it is far advanced.

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—A chancre appears on the skin, either on the mouth, in the mouth, or on the genitals. It\nis also called a hard chancre or Hunterian sore. This is a red, painless, raised ulcer with hard, welldefined edges, and appears 10 days to 3 weeks after exposure, and lasts from a few days to several\nweeks. In women, it sometimes develops on the cervix and so is not recognized.\nLater, a rash and patches of flaking tissue appear in the mouth or genital area. This skin eruption consists\nof either a few red, pimply, blemishes or a profuse crop of various types of blotches. By this time, the\ndisease is well-established throughout the system.\nLater stages occur, as the disease worsens. Paralysis, insanity, and death are the final outcome.\nCAUSES—Syphilis is caused by the germ, treponema pallidum, which is corkscrew in shape and much\nlarger than most bacteria. Drying quickly kills the germs, so they must remain wet; they generally enter\nthe body through a living source—another person (acquired syphilis) or through the placenta to the\nunborn child (congenital syphilis).

Nearly 10% of men and 70% of women who have chlamydia—have no symptoms.

About 30% of the women become\nsterile and pelvic inflammatory disease and other reproductive problems can, and do, result. In young\nwomen, the disease can also produce a form of arthritis.\nIn men, prostate infection and seminal vesicle inflammation may occur later. (Symptoms of prostatitis\ninclude pain when urinating and a watery mucous urethral discharge.)\nThe disease is transmitted through the discharge produced by both men and women.

Only in Christ can they be resolved.\nHe can do for you those things you could never do for yourself.\nGENITAL HERPES (Herpes Type II)\nSYMPTOMS—Recurrent fluid-filled blisters on the genitals that rupture, leaving red, inflamed, painful\nlesions. These are preceded by a slightly irritating tingling. When the lesion appears, it is accompanied\nby a sharp pain.\nCAUSES—Of the 90 varieties of animal herpes, only four affect humans. Herpes is a virus that causes\nrecurrent blisters and ulcers (cold sores, also called fever blisters on the lips [Type I] and on the genitals\n[Type II]). (See \"Cold Sores\" for information on Type I.) A third type is herpes zoster, which causes\nchicken pox and, as a secondary infection, shingles. (See \"Chicken pox\" and \"Shingles.\") Type II can\nproduce blisters either on the genitals or on, or around, the mouth.\nWe will here deal only with Type II, which is also called herpes genitalis, venereal herpes, and genital\nherpes. It is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. One-sixth of all\nAmericans (about 30 million) have the disease, although about half never develop serious symptoms. A\nhalf million new cases are reported yearly, and 80% are 20 to 39 years of age. The first attack generally\noccurs about 4-8 days after initial exposure to a sexual partner. Each occurrence is quite painful and lasts\nup to three weeks; but, once a person is infected, the disease can be transmitted at any time. Symptoms\nreoccur from every few weeks to once a year or less. Scarring does not usually occur, but can. Outbreaks\nrarely occur after the age of 50.\nHerpes is a virus which enters the body thorough the skin and travels into nerve groups at the base of the\nspine. It remains with you the rest of your lifetime. But it can be dormant for years and then appear\nagain when the immune system is lowered by poor diet, stress, illness, too much sunlight, or harmful\nchemicals.\nType II reoccurs when sexual intercourse takes place, as a result of irritation to the skin. It is not a newly\ninvaded infection, but one which was received from a sexual partner at an earlier time.\nThis viral infection can range from a symptomless infection in the nerves to a major inflammation of the\nliver, accompanied by fever. In women, it can lead to cervical cancer.\nThere seems to be a link between having Type II and later developing atherosclerosis.\nAs a baby passes through an infected birth canal, it can get Type II and possibly have brain damage,\nblindness, or death as a result. If an attack occurs late in the pregnancy, the baby should be delivered by\ncesarean section. If no lesions are present, the baby is far less likely to become infected as it passes\nthrough the birth canal.",

But,\ninstead, it is an exploding epidemic.\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) invades special immune cells in the body, which are called T\nlymphocytes, and then slowly multiplies over a long period of time. As it does so, the body's immune\nsystem gradually crumbles. All this time, the disease appears to lay dormant (and only an HIV test will\nreveal that a person even has the disease). But, after three to ten years, enough of the body's defenses are\nbroken down that full-blown AIDS develops. Suddenly, very pronounced symptoms appear, which are\ncalled \"AIDS-related diseases.\" These include pneumo-cystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, found in 60% of\nthose with AIDS), Karposi's sarcoma (a rare type of skin cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; which see),\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis.\nThe less deadly AIDS-related diseases are often the first to appear. The first sign is often the tongue\ncoated with white bumps. This is oral thrush, a type of candida (candidiasis; which see). Intestinal\nparasites (which see) and herpes simplex virus (herpes type I) are two other relatively simple infections\nwhich can occur. All indicate that the body's immune system is damaged, although candida, parasites,\nherpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus, and tuberculosis can occur in those who do not have AIDS.\nMost of those who are HIV-positive eventually develop full-blown AIDS. Once that occurs, they\ngenerally live only a few years. The median survival time, after full-blown AIDS appears, is 26 months.\nResearchers are searching for an \"AIDS cure\"; but the HIV virus changes form so fast, it is unlikely a\ncure will ever be found.\nSome say the origin of AIDS is unknown, and that the earliest documented case of it appeared in 1981 in\nSan Francisco. But there may be undocumented cases of it in the 1970s.\nOthers say that there is a different origin of AIDS. Dr. Eva Snead feels that the virus was created in the\nlaboratories. She insists that, if you have been vaccinated, you have the virus.\nThen there is Dr. William Campbell Douglass, M.D., who, in his book, AIDS the End of Civilization,\nmaintains that the vaccines were made from the kidney of the green African monkeys, and that the\ndisease was purposely invented to eliminate certain people.\nThe disease is transmitted by oral, vaginal, and anal sex; common needles for IV drugs; contaminated\nhospital and dental equipment; commercially prepared blood products; and immunotoxic lubricants. In\nother words, HIV is transmitted by sex, street drug IVs, blood transfusions, and getting someone else's\nblood into your eyes or into cuts on your skin. It is not possible to contract HIV by giving blood.",

Avoid removing\nthe stinger with your fingers; use a knife blade to scrape it out, to avoid squeezing in more\npoison.\n- Apply a paste of baking soda and water on the area or a compress that is wet with\nammonia water (more useful for scorpion stings).\n- Wet a little calcium gluconate and put it on the area.\n- Crush a charcoal tablet and place in the area, and cover with cloth. This will reduce pain\nand swelling. Put some wet powdered charcoal in an cloth and tie it on for 3-4 hours.\n- Charcoal has an amazing adsorptive (not absorptive) ability to pull into itself toxins and\npoisons, thus neutralizing them. This is due to its large chemical surface and the fact that\ncharcoal is pure carbon. The carbon molecules are eager to unite with other substances.\n- Clay or mud can also be used, especially if you are out in the woods. Put some mud on it\nas soon as possible and leave it on for a half hour. Try to select the mud from a clean\nplace, not from a mud hole, where animals may have polluted it. If pain persists, apply\ncharcoal.\n- An enzyme-based meat tenderizer breaks down the proteins that make up insect venom,\nbut you have to use it right away for it to be effective.\n- To avoid infection, do not scratch the area.\n- Also helpful are calcium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or ammonium chloride on the area.\n- Apply poultice of white oak bark and leaves, comfrey, and slippery elm.\n- Pain gels, DMSO, or Caladryl lotions can be applied.\n- Calamine lotion often reduces the itching.\n- Drink as much yellow dock tea as you can or take echinacea (tea or in capsule form).\n- Ironically, either hot or cold will lessen the pain.\n- A lengthy hot tub bath will help relieve abdominal pain that often develops after a bite.\n- A cold pack or ice pack on the area will help relieve pain.\n- Those sensitive to stings should avoid situations in which they might get stung. If they\nhave to be in such localities, they are wise to carry adrenalin (epinephrine) with them and\nbe accompanied by a friend who can go for help. Reactions can occur within minutes or\nhours. Contact a physician. Death can result if treatment is not sought.\n- If you have a known allergy to a certain venom, you can have a physician prescribe an\nemergency treatment kit which you can keep with you.\n- Purchase a small venom extractor and keep it with you.\n- Squashing a yellow jacket releases a chemical that causes other yellow jackets to attack.\nWhen one stings, that also causes the others to become excited. If bit, run. Go indoors or\njump into water. Insects have a hard time following a person through a thicket of woods.\n- Insects are repelled by the odor of turpentine.\n- Stinging insects prefer dark colors. So wear white or light-colored clothing.\n- Do not wear perfumes of any kind.\n- Insects are attracted to people who are deficient in zinc. Take at least 60 mg a day.\n- Sometimes brewer's yeast or garlic rubbed on the skin deters insects.\n- Drinking alcohol or eating an excess of sugar attracts biting, and other, insects.\n- Also see \"Spider Bite,\" which includes that of black widows. Also see \"Snake Bite.\"\nTreatment for a black widow bite is the same as that for a snake bite.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Praise God for all His blessings, and you will have more to praise Him for.\nHow many are the dangers He has protected you from!",

The person will feel like he is overheated or has a slight fever.\nCAUSES—There are three types of lice which infect people: the head louse (pediculosis capitis), the\nbody louse (p. corporis), and the crab louse (p. pubis). Crab lice (also called crabs) are spread by sexual\ncontact.\nLice can be spread by hanging coats, scarves, and caps together or using someone else's comb, brush,\netc. They live on the clothing (especially in the seams), travel to the skin once a day for a meal, then\nback onto the clothing.\nLice live about 30 days, and the female lays about ten eggs a day. The tiny eggs (nits) are laid at the base\nof a hair shaft. As the hair grows, the nits are carried upward and can be seen. They look like tiny black\nor rust-colored spots at, or near, the base of the hair. They can even be found on the chest, beard, and\neyelashes.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—One or two tiny bite holes which cause intense pain; frequently there is nausea,\nvomiting, and unconsciousness.\nCAUSES—There are two types of poisonous serpents in North America:\nThe pit viper (which includes rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cotton mouths [also called water\nmoccasins]) has a deep, heat-sensitive, pit on each side of the head. Pit vipers lunge forward, bite, and\nimmediately pull back. Their venom contains a blood poison.\nThe coral snake does not jump and, when it catches hold of the flesh, must hold on and chew awhile for\nthe poison to sink in. Its venom is a nerve poison.\nMore on identifying coral snakes: They are found only in the southernmost areas of the United States, as\nwell as south of the border, and have brightly colored rings. There is a non-poisonous snake which looks\nsimilar, but the colored rings are arranged differently. Remember it this way: \"Red by black, friend of\nJack; but black by yellow, kill a fellow.\"\nThe danger from snake bite occurs when the poison reaches the heart, and, secondarily, the effect of that\npoison on the blood and nervous system.\nThe action of the venom is rapid, regardless of the type of poisonous snake. There is rapid swelling and\ninflammation.\nIf treatment is not immediately given, the poison may cause death. If not death, then, after the initial\neffects of pain and shock begin to wear off, extensive tissue damage begins. There is suppuration,\ngangrene, sloughing, and hemorrhage.

      "overview": "- The best single remedy you can keep on hand is a small hand-suction extractor for\nimmediately pulling the poison out of the wound. Continue this for half an hour. (This\nsuction is less useful for coral snake venom, but use it on all snake bites anyway!) If there\nis no other way to extract the poison, another person should suck it out, continually\nspitting out the blood, for half an hour.\n- The person doing the sucking should not have any sores in his mouth.\n- Suction can also be done with a pop bottle heated and applied. As it cools a vacuum is\nformed.\n- Another alternative is to cut off the end of a plastic injection syringe at the bottom of the\nlarge end, apply to the bitten area, and pull back on the plunger.\n- Have the patient lie down, keep him calm and warm, apply a tourniquet above the limb\nwhere the wound is. This constricting band should be tight enough to shut off the venous\nblood, but not so tight that it stops the arterial circulation. Loosen the band 15 seconds\nevery 10 minutes.\n- The instruction formerly was to cut across between the two bite holes, so you could suck\nout more blood and poison. The current theory is that no cuts should be made, but only\nsucking. It might be the best to suck and spit for a couple minutes; this will clean the\nsurface as well. Then cut across, so you can suck even better. But, when you are in the\ncrisis, do what seems best.\n- Do not give liquor to the person, thinking that this will help him. It does not!\n- Specific antivenin serums are in stock for various species of snakes. Learn to identify the\nvarious snakes in your locality. (Coral snakes are primarily found only in the southeastern\nstates.)\n- Massive doses of vitamin C may save a life.\n- Keep calm and work carefully. Excitement speeds up the blood flow to the heart.\n- In most cases, the person does not die. But pray and get yourself prepared for whatever\nmay happen.\n- After the suction process is over, take charcoal from the campfire, mix it with water and\ndrink it, as follows: a half glassful of water with 1 teaspoon of charcoal, and drink another\none every 15 minutes until the danger is past.\n- If able to do so, a couple hours later, take a steam bath or something similar, to sweat out\nthe poison.\n- Throughout all this time, you should eat no food.\n- If, after several hours, the bite area is still swollen and painful, put kerosene on a cloth\nand apply it, keeping it wet for several hours. This will help neutralize the poison. An\nalternative is to grind up raw onions and apply to the area. Leave them there until an\noffensive odor, not of onions, is noticed. Remove; bathe the area; and apply more raw,\ncrushed, onions until the pain is gone.\nENCOURAGEMENT—When trials and tribulations come to you, know that every thing will work out\nwell if, through dedication and prayer, you will keep close to God.\nSection 16\nPoisons\nPart 2\nTransmitted Diseases",

    "fields": {
      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Between 2 and 32 days after the bite, symptoms appear: fatigue, flu-like symptoms,\nstiff neck, backache, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nUltimately, enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen may occur, along with irregular heart rhythm,\narthritis, and brain damage.\nSome of these symptoms slowly pass away over 2-3 years. But sometimes symptoms recur later without\nhaving been bitten again.\nBecause this disease is now so prominent, and because it can occur so mysteriously, here are more\ndetailed symptoms on its usual 3 stages (which not everyone goes through):\n1 - Small raised bumps (and/or a rash) appear on the entire body for 1-2 days or several\nweeks and then fades. Fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.\n2 - Weeks or months later, facial paralysis may occur. Frequently, enlargement of the\nspleen and lymph glands occurs and/or severe headaches, enlargement of the heart\nmuscle, and abnormal heart rhythm.\n3 - This can develop into backache, stiff neck, joint pains in the knees, swelling and pain\nin other joints, and even degenerative muscle and joint disease.\nPhysicians especially look for these symptoms, before treating with antibiotics: a small red bump at the\nsite of the tick bite; a bull's-eye rash surrounding it; and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, chills, and\njoint pain. If treatment is postponed until more advanced symptoms develop (heart, brain, or joint\nproblems), drug medications do not work as well.\nCAUSES—The bite of a tiny tick (Ixodes dammini) is primarily carried by deer; but it is also carried, in\nthe eastern states, by white-footed field mice and, in the west, by lizards and jackrabbits. In California it\nis also transmitted by the black-legged tick, carried by wood rats.\nBoth deer ticks and black-legged ticks are very tiny: An adult is less than 1/10th of an inch, and the\nnymph is a pinhead in size. They are much smaller than a dog tick.\nLyme disease most frequently occurs where the white-tailed deer is most abundant, which is the\nnortheastern states. Eight states report 90% of the cases: Connecticut, Massachusetts, California,\nMinnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. But it has occurred in every state\nexcept Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana, and Nebraska. The disease was first identified in the mid1970s in Lyme, Connecticut.\nDogs and cats can collect these special ticks out in the woods and bring them into your home.\nTick bites are generally painless and unnoticed; so the symptoms may not at first, or later, be correctly\ndiagnosed. But in advanced stages, when correct diagnosis finally occurs, the situation may have\nbecome critical.\nThe symptoms are similar to those of multiple sclerosis, gout, and Epstein-Barr virus (chronic fatigue\nsyndrome), all three of which see.\nA test now exists which can detect the bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) which causes Lyme disease.\nAntibodies are present from 3 days to 3 weeks after infection.\nThe majority of cases occur in the summer and fall. After a tick bites, it waits several hours before it\nbegins to feed on the host's blood; and, once it does, it feasts for 3-4 days. The longer the tick remains\nattached, the greater the risk of Lyme disease.\nLyme disease is treatable and almost always curable if correctly diagnosed in the early stages. But,\nbecause the bites are usually painless, the incubation period so long, and the symptoms so varied, the\nproblem may go unrecognized for weeks or months.\nIf you develop a bull's-eye type of rash anywhere on your body, see your health-care provider right\naway.",

Do not twist. You want the entire tick out, without leaving part of it in the\nskin or injecting bacteria from its broken body into the skin. You may pour rubbing\nalcohol on the tick before pulling him out. Do not touch the tick with your hands. Do not\napply kerosene, turpentine, or petroleum jelly.\n- Wash your hands and the bite area. Apply rubbing alcohol to the bite area. Do not use a\nmatch to get the tick out.\n- Save the tick in a jar. Call a physician if you want it tested immediately. Watch for\nsymptoms over the next 3 weeks.\n- Put suspicious clothing in the dryer for 30 minutes, to kill ticks by dehydration. Washing\nclothes, even in hot water and bleach, does not necessarily kill ticks.\n- Heat relieves pain. Hot baths are helpful. See \"Fevers.\"\nPREVENTION—The best solution to this problem is prevention. Avoid going out in the woods in the\nsummer months, when ticks are the most active (especially June to August). Stay on the center of the\ntrails. Check yourself and your children carefully afterward.\nWear long pants and tuck them into your socks. Wear a long-sleeved shirt with a high neck or scarf, plus\nhat or gloves. If the clothing is light-colored, you can see the ticks better.\nYou may choose to use an insect repellent containing deet (diethyl toluamide). It lasts longer than\nothers, and is said to be safe on the outside. But it is deadly if taken into your body, and dissolves\nplastics and synthetics.\nNot everyone bitten acquires the disease. A high sugar and fat diet attracts insects! The skin eliminates\ntoxins, which attract bugs when the diet is unnatural.\nWhen the blood is pure and the body clean, there is far less likelihood of tick bites and lice infestation.\nA diet high in fiber and natural food will help keep the body clean and protect against infections. Sugar\nattracts insects.\nHerbs useful in preventing infections include: echinacea, goldenseal, garlic, and burdock. Rubbing with\nlemon juice will disinfect the area. Aloe vera on the area will aid in healing.\nVitamins A and C protect against infections. B complex vitamins help keep the blood clean. Eat lots of\ngreens.\nA test is now available, but false positives occur sometimes. So, if you are being treated for Lyme\ndisease and are not getting better, consider having a second test made. One study of nearly 800 people,\ndiagnosed with Lyme disease, revealed that half of them did not have it! Physicians blame false-positive\ntests for this.\n—Also see \"Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—If, through surrender and prayer, you are in Christ, as the trials come, the\npower of God will come with them. You will receive exactly that which is best at this time.\nBUBONIC PLAGUE (The Plague)\nSYMPTOMS—Following an incubation period of 2-10 days, the disease begins suddenly with a high\nfever, severe headache, great weakness, and pains in the back and limbs. There may be vomiting and\ndiarrhea.\nThe fever may go up to 104o F. the first day, accompanied by intense thirst.\nBuboes (swollen places) begin to appear the second day in the groin, under the arms, and in the neck.\nThe disease causes great weakness, and death often occurs sometime between the third and sixth day.\nCAUSES—In the bubonic form of the plague, the lymph glands swell; when swollen, they are called\n\"buboes.\"\nThis is a disease carried by the Norway rat. The bacteria are in its droppings, which it leaves in the food\nstuffs it has broken into and partly eaten.\nIn earlier centuries, several outbreaks of the plague occurred; during one of which one-sixth of the\npeople of Europe died.\nThere is also a pneumonic form of the plague, which is far less common. The symptoms are about the\nsame as pneumonia, but it is transmitted through the air and is extremely contagious.\nThe plague essentially never occurs in the Western world today.

The final stages\nare depression, exhaustion and sometimes paralysis, coma, and death.\nIf the symptoms of rabies have already begun to appear, the person will probably die.\nSee end of this article for symptoms in a rabid dog.

      "overview": "- A backwoodsy nature doctor, who has treated all kinds of things with remarkable\nsuccess, says to do this: Wash the wound with water right away and then mix with half\nand half vinegar and warm water, and wash the wounds with it. When dry, apply 1-2\ndrops of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) to each wound. Do this even if, what appears to\nbe, a rabid dog only licks a previous wound on you.\n- For extra precaution, you may apply a tourniquet and a rubber vacuum cup as for a snake\nbite (which see for further details). If acid is not available, you may burn the wound with a\nmagnifying glass in the sunlight. Or use a red-hot iron. Then treat as for a regular burn\nuntil it is healed. This treatment usually prevents further worry. So says this\nbackwoodsman.\n- Jethro Kloss has a lengthy article on this in his book, Back to Eden (pp. 490-495) (see\norder sheet). He also says to put hydrochloric acid on the wound, to neutralize the rabies\npoison in the saliva. Then, after discussing a number of herbal remedies to also use, he\nquotes a scientific paper by an M. Buisson, read to the French Academy of Arts and\nSciences. M. Buisson had accidentally contracted rabies from a women suffering with it.\nBy the time he discovered he had it, the disease was advanced and he knew he was soon to\ndie. Kloss quotes a London newspaper which reported on the scientific paper:\n\"Concluding from these various symptoms that he was suffering with\nhydrophobia, he [Buisson] resolved to make an end of himself by\nsuffocating himself in a vapor [steam] bath. With this view, he raised the\nheat very, very, hot, but was delighted, no less than surprised, to find that all\nhis pains disappeared. He went out of the bath completely cured, ate a\nhearty dinner, and drank more freely than was usual with him. He adds that\nhe has treated more than fourscore persons who have been bitten by mad\ndogs in a similar manner, and they all recovered, with the exception of a\nchild seven years old, who died in a vapour bath he was\nadministering.\"—Kloss, Back to Eden, p. 493.\n- Water therapists normally work with a steam bath temperature of 115o-120o F. (See our\nWater Therapy Manual (see order sheet) for detailed information on steam baths, pp. 131138.) Those with diabetes, valvular heart disease, extreme arteriosclerosis, or emaciation\nshould not use a steam bath.\nKloss also quotes a German newspaper which discussed an incident which happened in Saxony:\n- \"A Saxon forester named Gastell, at the age of 82, unwilling to take to the grave with\nhim a secret of so much importance, has made public in the Leipsic Journal the method\nwhich he used for fifty years, and he affirms he has rescued many human beings and cattle\nfrom the fearful death of hydrophobia. Wash the wound immediately with warm water\nand vinegar; let it dry, and then pour upon the wound a few drops of hydrochloric acid,\nand that will neutralize and destroy the poison of the saliva.\"—Op. cit., p. 494.\nWe included the above as a matter of historical interest. Now we return to modern physiologic and\nmedical theory on rabies:\n- Nearly all human rabies cases result from dog bites. The animal can transmit disease\nbefore it shows symptoms of rabies; but, except in rare instances, the symptoms will\nappear within 10 days if it is rabid. The disease is always fatal, unless it is halted by a\nseries of Pasteur treatments, which are started before symptoms first appear.\n- If at all possible, it is crucial to confine the animal which inflicted the bite so it can be\nobserved. The course of the disease runs so fast that the animal should show symptoms of\nrabies before they begin to appear in the person. If the animal is rabid, it will show clear\nsigns within 2 weeks, then the person bitten should begin the Pasteur series of rabies shots\n(unless circumstances are clear that the animal was not rabid).\n- If the animal got away and cannot be found, then the person should immediately take the\nrabies vaccine series.\n- If the series has already been started, and the animal is then found not to have rabies, the\nPasteur treatments can be stopped.\n- About 10%-12% of persons bitten by a known rabid animal, and not treated, will\ncontract rabies and die. If the Pasteur series is started within 2 weeks or less after the bite,\nabout one-third of 1% of those bitten will die.\n- It is not widely known that rabies is sometimes transmitted accidentally in hospitals.\nRabies in humans is sometimes misdiagnosed as a stroke. After death, some of that rabid\ntissue may be transplanted to another person.\n- If your child's pet hamster bites him, do not think the child needs to start rabies shots.\nKnow that, if you have had that hamster for 3 weeks or more and it shows no symptoms of\nrabies, the hamster does not have rabies.\n- Rabies shots last 10 days and are so difficult to take that the person often goes to the\nhospital for respiratory support while they are in progress.\nSYMPTOMS IN THE DOG—Initially, there is a marked change in its disposition. He will become\nvery friendly or very snappy; the bark becomes hoarse.\nParalysis may soon develop—first the lower jaw, then the hind legs, and gradually the rest of the body.\nBut, instead, the dog wants to run away. It may run for miles, snapping at any creature which comes near\nit.\nFinally, it becomes exhausted and paralysis sets in.\nIf a dog shows signs of rabies, it must be chained (not roped), and observed for 2 weeks.\n—Also see \"Dog or Animal Bite\" and \"Antispasmodic Tincture.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus encourages you to persevere in prayer. In Him you can find the help you\nneed for the crisis you face.\nTULAREMIA (Rabbit fever)\nSYMPTOMS—The first indication is a local ulceration at the infection site. About 1-7 days after\ninfection occurs, chills, headache, prostration, and general pains suddenly begin. The disease is\ncharacterized by high fever and recurring chills with drenching sweat. A shallow but ongoing ulcer\ndevelops at the site of the original wound or bite. Lymph glands draining that area become swollen and\npainful (but they should not be lanced!).\nIf not treated, the fever generally lasts 3-4 weeks, and generally is not fatal. But convalescence is slow.\nPhysical and mental depression can last for months.\nCAUSES—One cause is the bite of an animal, generally a rabbit. A more frequent cause today (87%) is\ncutting oneself while skinning and dressing infected rabbits or ground squirrels. Often these are wild\nrabbits.\nIf you notice the appearance of symptoms—and you have been working with rabbits, especially wild\nones—then have the condition immediately diagnosed. Sputum samples are highly contagious, so the lab\nshould be warned about your suspicions.\nTREATMENT—Go to a physician.\nENCOURAGEMENT—We yearn for a deeper, broader, sense of God's presence. As we seek for it, we\nfind the strength, peace, and encouragement we need. God will help you.\nCAT COCCIDIA (Toxoplasmosis)\nSYMPTOMS—Symptoms can mimic the flu, cause headache, high fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes,\nmeningitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, blindness, and diarrhea.\nIf a pregnant woman contracts this disease, it will cause birth defects in the fetus (brain defects,\nblindness, and/or mental retardation).\nCAUSES—Those who keep cats should be aware of this danger. Cat coccidia is caused by a tiny\nprotozoa (Isospora bigemina) which lives in the intestines of cats. Apparently, it is in many cats!\nThis disease is acquired by inhaling or swallowing dust from contaminated kitty litter boxes or outdoor\nsand or dirt piles. But it can also come from eating rare beef. While that protozoa is in an intermediate\nstage, it is outside the cat's intestines—and can enter the human body.",

    "fields": {
      "overview": "WHAT IT IS—The Pulse Test is mentioned in this book occasionally. It was devised by Arthur Coca,\nM.D., and is discussed in detail in his book, The Pulse Test. It is a simple home method, to determine\nwhich foods you are allergic to.\nHOW TO DO THE PULSE TEST—Identifying specific food allergens can improve your health. Each\ntest is simple enough, but they must be continued over a period of time.\nFirst, how do you take your pulse? Place your finger on an artery somewhere on your body that you can\neasily feel. Nurses check the pulse at the inside of the wrist. The author has found that it is much easier\nto check it on the upper front side of his neck, at the carotid artery. Have a stopwatch in your other hand\nand time the beats for one minute.\nTo perform this test, you take your pulse. This is called your basal pulse or base pulse rate.\nThen you eat a single food, and check your pulse rate in 15, 30, and 60 minutes afterward.\nAn elevation in pulse rate of more than ten beats; that is, it beats more than 10 beats faster per minute\nthan your base pulse. This means that you are allergic to that food.\nA problem is that you may wish to eat more than one food at a time. You can take your base pulse, then\nsit down and eat your entire meal and keep checking your pulse 15, 30, and 60 minutes after you\nfinished. In this way you will obtain an inkling that everything was all right at that meal or that\nsomething was wrong. Gradually, over a period of time, you can narrow it down, and then work on\nspecific foods. Eating only one at a time and checking your pulse on those.\nOTHER TESTS—Here are several other tests:\nThe Elimination Diet: Eliminate certain foods from your meal for several days, and see how it affects\nyour pulse. This is a good pattern to use in connection with the Pulse Test.\nFood Rotation Diets: This is said to be a good method. Grains, proteins, and other suspected foods are\narranged in the diet so that their consumption is not repeated more frequently than every 4-5 days. This\nhelps you figure things out a little more quickly with your pulse test.\nThe Fast Test: Fast for five days and then add individual foods and test each one with your pulse. This is\nfar more accurate, but who wants to eat like a mouse all that time? The theory behind this method is that\nmany reactions take 5 days to settle down and another 3-5 days to begin again. But following that\ntheory, you will not be eating much for a good long time.\nSkin Patch Test: This is something you can buy at your drugstore. Perhaps it will tell you something.\nThe Diet Diary: This method helps when offending foods seem to afterward bother you emotionally,\ngive you headaches, etc. You keep an ongoing meal diary, at which you note what you ate, and\nafterward write down how it affected you. Within minutes or hours after eating an offending food, there\nmay be indications of problems.\nThe RAST Test—This test costs about $15 per food item, and you may want to use it, after narrowing the\nrange with the other tests. The Radioallergiabsorbent Test (RAST Test) identifies specific antibodies in\nthe blood to certain foods or other substances. Usually common allergenic foods, such as wheat, milk,\neggs, yeast, and citrus are tested. But any food can be a problem. Most good laboratories do RAST tests.\nHowever, because it is extremely selective (only showing up positive Ige-mediated allergies), many\nfalse-negative reactions occur.\nThe Cytotoxic Allergy Test: This test exposes some of your white blood cells to a fraction of the\nsuspected food or substance. A battery of 38 to 40 tests of common foods are routinely tested for only\n$80 to $90, so it is less expensive and more convenient than RAST. Even inhalants, food dyes, or other\nchemicals can be tested! But the test is only done at large medical centers; and, again, many falsepositives occur. Some experts question the reliability of this test, since human interpretation is required\nto analyze the results.\nUnfortunately, results of RAST and the cytotoxic tests rarely agree. (It is said that each test locates\ndifferent \"systems\" of allergies.) Frankly, it seems that you would do best just checking your pulse at\nhome, and saving the money.\nOnce you have identified specific allergenic foods, you then eliminate them from your diet.\n—See \"Allergies\" and \"Hay Fever.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—What must it be like to be close to God? It is a little heaven on earth, to go to\nheaven in. Yet, by daily surrender and prayer, we can each have this experience. Through the enabling\nstrength of Christ obey His Ten Commandment law, and you will fulfill His plan for your earthly life.\nHAY FEVER (Allergic Rhinitis)\nSYMPTOMS—Itching in the nose, throat, and eyes. Runny or stuffy nose, headaches, pain in the head\nand sinuses, blurred vision, red and itchy eyes, postnasal drip. A clear, watery, discharge from the nose\nand eyes occurs. There is sneezing and nervous irritability.\nCAUSES—Hay fever is most frequently caused by breathing in plant pollens. (Ragweed and grass\npollen are the worst offenders.) The problem tends to be seasonal (spring or fall), according to plant\ncycles. But some may have to suffer with it all year long if they are sensitive to dust, feathers, or animal\ndanders. Such people are said to have perennial allergic rhinitis.\nHay fever is a reaction of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and air passages to such seasonal\npollens, as well as to dust, feathers, animal hair, and other irritants.\nDry, windy, days; riding in an open car; and working in the garden sometimes increase symptoms.\nMorning and evening hours are the most uncomfortable. Midday may be better.\nStressful situations and alcoholic beverages can trigger an attack.\nAnger, resentment, or negative thoughts can increase the symptoms.\nHay fever sufferers frequently also have asthma and dermatitis.\nThe body is trying to clean out toxins and dust. If the diet is not nutritious; if the person is eating too\nmuch or eating foods, such as milk, ice cream, sugar, and white-flour products, the overloaded system\ncannot deal properly with the additional task of resisting the effects of airborne pollens.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—Pain, vomiting, cramping, weakness, diarrhea, dizziness.\nSymptoms occur quickly, 1-4 hours after eating the contaminated substance. They can last for a few\nhours or a few days.\nSalmonella symptoms: pain, vomiting, and diarrhea can require several days to appear.\nStaphylococcus aureus symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting 2-6 hours after the meal. It is good to\ninduce vomiting, to help rid the system of toxins.\nBotulism symptoms: 12-48 hours after ingestion, symptoms appear. Extreme weakness, double vision,\nswallowing difficulty. Paralysis and death can follow.\nGiardia symptoms: Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, flatulence, and\nvomiting.\nCAUSES—Eating food containing harmful bacteria causes food poisoning. Each year more than 2\nmillion Americans report food poisoning. Of course, the actual number is far higher. Unfortunately, we\nlive in a poisoned age. About 2 million Americans report food poisoning each year; of that number,\n9,000 people die each year. A far greater number have food poisoning, who think it is the flu.\nA full 90% of botulism cases in the United States are caused by improper home canning. The safest\nmethod is to cook the jarred food in a pressure cooker rather than in a tub on top of the stove.\nTwo-thirds of all food poisoning cases were related to the use of poorly cooked eggs.\nThe types of bacteria in food which cause disease (pathogenic) or produce toxins (toxigenic) cannot be\nseen, tasted, or smelled in the food.\nHere are the most common of these food poisoning organisms:\nSalmonella (Salmonellosis): This is the most common cause of food poisoning. It has especially\nincreased since antibiotics began being placed in animal feeds, to prevent disease in crowded,\nunsanitary, conditions and help them grow faster. (More than 50% of cattle, poultry, and swine are now\ngiven antibiotics.) But, doing this, promoted the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal\nintestines. A third of all chickens in America have salmonella.\nSalmonella is easily transmitted on hands, food supplies, knives, table tops, cracked eggs, partly raw\nfood, etc. Mechanical methods of evisceration in slaughterhouses also spread salmonella to all the other\nbirds being slaughtered. Cooks that handle raw meat or eggs, and then handle other food—especially\nraw food, such as salads—endanger many people. Vegetarians should wash their hands with soap,\nimmediately after handling raw egg shells. Cook eggs well. (Beware of mayonnaise; it contains raw\neggs.) Milk and ice cream can also be contaminated with salmonella. In 1985, 17,000 people in the\nnortheast became ill from contaminated milk.\nOutbreaks of salmonella poisoning primarily occur in the warmer months. Symptoms range from mild\nabdominal pain to severe diarrhea, and even typhoid-like fever. This disease can so weaken the immune\nsystem that the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels are damaged. Arthritis can result.\nEating raw or poorly cooked chicken, eggs, beef, and pork products is the main way salmonella is eaten.\nBut it can also be found in clams and oysters.\nOf 35 food poisoning outbreaks reported between 1985 to 1987, 24 were caused by contaminated eggs,\nor foods containing them. Boil eggs for at least 25 minutes.\nWe will briefly note some other sources of food-borne illness:\nStaphylococcus aureus: This is said to be the second-largest source of food poisoning (25%). This can\nbe transmitted by coughing and sneezing on food.\nClostridium botulinum: This is old-fashioned botulism. Many restaurants and roadhouses leave food\nsetting out at room temperature for hours. This can also be found in old mustard and other sauce jars.\nAlthough easily destroyed by cold or heat, botulism is the most deadly of all the food-borne diseases. It\nproduces toxins which block nerve impulses to the muscles.\nHeating food to 176o F. for 20 minutes or 194o F. for 10 minutes destroys the spores. Home-canned\nfood, not properly cooked, can be dangerous. Never use contents of a bulging can or a rusty can! It is\nfound in canned vegetables, meats, fish, mushrooms, and soups.\nGiardia (giardiasis): This is found in drinking water from lakes and streams. It is not destroyed by water\ntreatment, including chlorination. It can also be found in raw food which has grown in contaminated\nwater. Giardia grows best where it is cool and damp.\nFour other sources of food poisoning should be mentioned: Staphylococcus, complobacter jejuini,\ncampylobacteriosis, and clostridium perfringens.\nEach of these comes primarily from eating meat, and sometimes dairy products.\nBefore concluding, keep in mind trichinae (trichinella), which is found in pork. Also beware of mold\nfound on food; it can produce poisonous toxins. Do not eat potato sprouts; they have concentrated\nsolanine which can cause hallucinations even after recovery.",

      "overview": "- As soon as you believe you have food poisoning, take a eyedropperful of alcohol-free\ngoldenseal extract every 4 hours for 24 hours. This natural antibiotic will destroy bacteria\nin the intestinal tract. (But never take goldenseal for more than a week at a time, during\npregnancy, or if you are allergic to ragweed.)\n- Take 6 charcoal tablets immediately, and again in 6 hours. They will help neutralize\npoisons in your bloodstream. Drink lots of good water (distilled is best).\n- Telephone your regional Poison Control Center. There is a different phone number for\neach state. Dial the operator (0) or emergency (911) and ask for that number in your state.\n- Use enemas to clean out the colon.\n- Someone should help the one vomiting, so he does not choke. If he does not stop\nvomiting within 24 hours, collect samples for analysis, to identify the poison.\n- Sometimes it is best to induce vomiting. Lobelia will help or drinking water and putting\na finger down the throat.\n- If food poisoning may have occurred in a restaurant or roadhouse, contact the health\ndepartment.\n- If the condition continues, contact a physician.\n- Research at the University of Wolverhamptom, in Britain, disclosed that all types of\ndisease-producing intestinal bacteria died when garlic was present.\n- A severe headache and vomiting soon after a meal may be caused by food allergies,\nwhich see. Charcoal tablets will help solve that problem.\nPREVENTION—It is best to stop eating meat and dairy products or, if you do, be sure they are most\nthoroughly cooked. Check home-canned jars carefully before opening them. Beware of restaurants,\nroadhouses, and salad bars. When eating out, you eat at your own risk. To help protect you, eat 2 garlic\ntablets before you eat anything else. Better yet, pack bag lunches and learn to buy what you need at a\ngrocery store.\nRefrigerate food you buy as soon as you can. Keep perishables refrigerated. Keep food hot or cold; food\nleft at room temperature encourages bacterial growth. Keep the refrigerator set at 40o F. or below, and\nthe freezer set at 0o F. or below.\nMeat, poultry, eggs, and seafood are especially dangerous. They must be cooked thoroughly and hands\nwashed; all utensils touching the raw materials must be sterilized. Do not use recipes calling for raw\neggs which will remain raw or be inadequately cooked. Do not leave mayonnaises, salad dressings, and\nmilk products sitting out at room temperature. Be especially careful at picnics.\nWash kitchen towels and sponges daily with a 1-20 bleach and water solution.\nDo not use bulging cans or products with loose lids or cracked jars! Rusted, sticky, or bent cans should\nbe discarded. Wash lunch boxes and Thermos bottles after each use.\nThaw all frozen foods in the refrigerator.\nWhen reheating food, bring it to a quick boil, and cook it for a minimum of 4 minutes.\nDo not give honey to a young baby below the age of one. Fed by the honey, botulism spores will grow in\nthe infant's intestine, producing botulism toxin.\nENCOURAGEMENT—By firm adherence to the right, through the grace of Christ, each one of us can\nfulfill God's plan for our lives. Go to Him in prayer and find the answers you need.\nPOISON IVY (Poison Oak; Poison Sumac)\nSYMPTOMS—In those only slightly sensitive to it: One or more small round bumps with a slight pus\narea showing in the center. Each one is extremely itchy. It is slightly itchy until touched by something\n(clothing, a hand, etc.), when it suddenly becomes intensely itchy. Scratching brings momentary relief,\nbut causes redness, rash, and more itching.\nIn those who are very sensitive to it: Extreme redness, rash, and large swelling of the affected area. The\nitch is continuous. Many large blisters develop. As the poison is spread over other parts of the body,\nboth fever and secondary infection may develop.\nSymptoms appear within a few hours to 7 days after contact with the plant.\nCAUSES—The three poison plants in North America (poison oak, ivy, and sumac) contain a oily,\nslightly sticky, sap in the flowers, fruit, stem, bark; and roots which, when touched, produces a contact\npapular dermatitis on the skin. The plant has the greatest amount of this sap in the spring and early\nsummer. The poison is urushiol, which has both a plant resin and a volatile oil. Even dead roots and\nstems contain urushiol.\nScratching can transmit the toxic substance to still other parts of the body.\nContact with the poison can be made, not only by touching the plant, but by touching an animal's fur,\ncontaminated clothing, shoes, etc. Smoke from burning plants can, through droplets, transmit it to the\nskin, nose, throat, or lungs. In some cases, children have eaten the leaves or grayish berries and\ndeveloped severe inflammation in the mouth.\nSensitivity to the plant varies from person to person, and even in different times in a person's life.\nLightweight fabrics do not adequately protect against poison ivy or oak.",

      "overview": "- If the possibility exists that you may have touched it, wash your hands as soon as\npossible. Carefully wash downward, so the water drips down off your hands rather than up\nyour arms. Wash with soap and water; rinse in running water; wash again with soap and\nwater. Do this several times in order to get the toxic oils off your skin. Then dry and see\nwhat happens.\n- As soon as you touch the plant, try to wash the skin with water, even if no soap is\navailable. The water tends to carry off the oil. If nothing else is available, in an emergency\napply paint thinner, ammonia, or acetone to carry off the oils.\n- Yellow laundry soap is best for this purpose. You want a strong cleansing soap which\ncuts oil and carries it away. An alkaline laundry soap or detergent is the best.\n- In washing the skin, never use a washcloth; it only moves the toxic oil around.\n- Wash clothing and gear in soapy water.\n- Those slightly sensitive to the plant can simply avoid touching or scratching the pimples,\nand the itching will be only slightly noticed. If they wish, they can briefly apply\ncompresses of hot, plain, water to the area.\n- Those strongly sensitive may wish to consult a physician.\n- Keep in mind that, for most people, the treatment for urushiol is to reduce the itching\nuntil the poison eventually leaves the system, at which time the rash completely clears up.\nWhat should you put on the affected area to reduce the itching? Here are several suggestions:\n- Jewelweed always ranks at the top of every list. This is a small plant with dark green\nleaves and red berries, which may be found in your locality. If you are sure it is jewelweed\n(and if you can find it), crush the leaves and rub them lightly on the affected area. Another\nmethod is to ball up the whole plant and wipe it over the area.\n- Other herbs include bloodroot, echinacea, goldenseal, lobelia, myrrh, plantain, or\nSolomon's seal.\n- Another method is to apply a tea made of 50-50 white oak bark and lime water. Place it\non a cloth, cover the area, and reapply as often as needed.\n- Most poisons are either strongly acid or alkaline in pH. For an alkaline antidote to the\nitching, place some form of calcium powder, mixed with water to hold it in place, on the\narea. Calcium gluconate (a dietary calcium supplement) is what the author uses. It nicely\nreduces the itching. An alternate alkaline method is to blend oatmeal into a fine powder,\nand add a small amount of water to make a paste. Goldenseal, a very alkaline substance,\ncan also be used. Banana peels, rubbed directly on the area, bring relief for as long as 4\nhours. Another way is to place calamine lotion on it (but beware of the antihistamine\nadditives in some brands of it; they can produce their own allergic rash). White shoe\npolish (which contains calcium and pipe clay) has also been used, but it may contain\nadditives you do not want.\n- There is also an acid approach to the problem! Acid substances have also been used\nwith success, to reduce itching: Wash lemon juice over the area, then pat dry. Repeat as\nneeded. Vinegar can be used.\n- Wet dressings and soaks are helpful. A physiologic saline solution (2 level teaspoons of\nsalt to a quart of water) is useful.\n- Run hot water (as hot as can be tolerated) over the area. This seems to wash off some of\nthe oils. Itching may stop for several hours. Repeat when needed.\n- When you are finished working on the affected area, you might wish to wash rubbing\nalcohol over the skin exposed to that area. This washes oils off your skin. (But this would\nappear to be a poor solution, since the oiless skin ought to have a higher affinity to the\nurushiol than oiled skin.)\nLearn to identify the plant:\n- Poison ivy is a small plant which, when a bush or tree is nearby, grows as a vine up it.\nGrowing in the eastern states, it has three leaves with a notch in the two outer ones. The\ncentral leaf is at the end of the stalk.\n- Poison oak is a bush, generally small but which can grow taller than a man. Growing in\nthe western states, it has the same three leaf and notch pattern, but the leaves are curly and\nappear thicker—more like a live oak.\n- Poison sumac is also a bush, and, with its compound leaves, looks very much like other\nsumac. It does not have the three-leaf pattern. You are less likely to ever encounter poison\nsumac.\n- Avoid forest or other outdoor wood or leaf fires, if one of the three toxic plants may be\nburning.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Amid all the perils of life, we need help from God. The shield of His grace\ncan preserve us from yielding to temptation to sin. But we must submit our lives to God if we would\nhave this help.\nSection 16\nPoisons\nPart 4\nInfestations",

Worms sometimes causes spasms or\nconvulsions.\nCAUSES—Worms live in the gastrointestinal tract or burrow from that tract into the muscles.\nThere are several types of parasitic worms which can live in human intestines, including tapeworms,\nhookworms, pinworms, whipworms, and roundworms.\nThe degree of infestation is determined, upon examination, by the type, size, and number of worms\nfound.\nWorms tend to eat your food! They irritate your intestinal lining, and reduce even more the amount of\nnutrients which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The worms also produce toxic waste which is\nharmful to your body.\nCauses include eating raw or poorly cooked meat; eating vegetation, polluted by contaminated water;\nimproper disposal of animal and human waste; and walking barefoot on soil. Scratching the anus will\ntransfer worm eggs on your fingers to anything else you touch.\nPinworms: Very tiny white worms, which cause rectal itching at night. Contracted by eating raw or\npoorly cooked vegetables which have contacted contaminated water. Scratching the anal area can also\ntransmit them on the fingers. (Also see \"Rectal Itching.\")\nTapeworms: Flat worms contracted from eating poorly cooked meat (beef, pork, and fish). The most\ncommon one (beef tapeworm) can grow to 20 feet in length in the human intestine.\nHookworms: Found in southern soil and sand, they enter by boring into the feet, but can also enter when\neating with unwashed hands.\nRoundworms: Most common in children, they bore through the intestinal wall and settle in other organs.\nBecause of the warmth of the bed, worms tend to come out of the anus. So inspect that area on children\nafter they are asleep.\nWorm infestation can lead to arthritis, colitis, fatigue, diabetes, headaches, indigestion, lupus, nausea,\nsinus trouble, back and neck pain, and cancer.",

      "overview": "Here are suggestions for purging worms from the body:\n- Aloe vera, taken in any form, is especially helpful in eliminating worms.\n- The following herbs help expel worms: cascara sagrada, wormwood, echinacea,\ngoldenseal, burdock, and black walnut. Do not use wormwood during pregnancy.\n- Grapefruit tea extract helps destroy parasites. Eat black walnut extract, pumpkin seeds,\nfig juice or figs, and chaparral tea or tablets.\n- Take diatomaceous earth capsules for 3 weeks, to get rid of your worms. (Do not\nimagine you do not have some; everyone generally does.) The worm eats this, and it\ncauses them to disintegrate.\n- Clean the colon with enemas and colonics. Take 2 per week for 4 weeks.\n- A hot water enema, with 3 teaspoons of salt to a quart of water, may get rid of\npinworms.\n- Eat a diet high in fiber, primarily from raw vegetables and whole grains.\n- For a time, avoid all sugar foods, including fruits, with the exception of figs and\npineapples.\n- Eat figs and pumpkin seeds. This can be combined with black walnuts.\n- Eat garlic, onions, cabbage, and carrots. They contain natural sulphur which helps expel\nworms. As you might expect, worms do not like garlic.\n- Make sure you are obtaining enough water. Drink only pure water (distilled).\n- To eliminate pinworms: Eat 1-2 bitter melons each day for 7-10 days. It is available in\nAsian markets.\n- To eliminate tapeworms: Fast 3 days on raw pineapple. The bromelain in it destroys\nthose worms.\n- Drink one cup of wormwood tea three times daily between meals.\n- Cut up two raw onions and soak them 12 hours in 1 pint water; strain while squeezing\nout the juice. Drink a cup of this 3 times a day. Along with this, use garlic enemas.\n- Powdered tansy, balmony, bitterroot, and wormwood can be put in capsules. Take two\ncapsules 4 times a day.\n- For children, crush garlic in milk and drink it throughout the day. Use a garlic enema\nevery morning.\n- For children, make senna tea, strain it, add enough raisins to soak up the tea. Give the\nchildren a teaspoon of raisins 2-5 times a day. Use garlic enemas, and put a garlic clove up\nthe rectum before bedtime.\nHere are other precautionary measures which should be taken:\n- Eat a nourishing diet, rich in vitamins and minerals. You need all the good nourishment\nyou can get. The worms are robbing you of so much.\n- Make sure your children, if they have worms, are getting adequate nutrition.\n- Do not eat sugar and junk food.\n- Never eat watercress. It grows in streams, many of which are now polluted. Watercress,\nwhich is eaten raw as a salad, can have pinworms and tapeworms on it.\n- Do not eat raw or partly cooked fish, beef, or pork.\n- Wash vegetables thoroughly before eating them raw.\n- Wash all underclothing, bed clothes, and sheets frequently in hot water.\n- Have all family members wash their hands frequently, especially after using the toilet,\nbefore meals, and bedtime. Do not bite nails.\n- Clean rooms frequently, especially bedrooms. Put some ammonia on a cloth, to dampen\nit as a dustcloth.\n- Sterilize toilet seats. The infected person should sleep alone.\n—Also see \"Convulsions\" and \"Ringworm.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Living day by day with God—as we pray to Him; obey Him; and walk with\nHim—can bring a peace and maturity to our lives that is so much needed.",

      "overview": "- Eat a nutritious diet, supplemented with vitamins and minerals.\n- Avoid mucous-forming foods (milk and white- flour products). Do not eat meat or\nprocessed foods.\n- Keep body parts clean and dry.\n- Apply crushed garlic to the affected area on the outside of the body, alternating with\nhoney.\n- Another formula for fungal infections of any kind is tea (te or tee) tree oil. Place some on\nthe affected area for 2-3 weeks and the problem may be eliminated. Tea tree oil smells\nlike eucalyptus, and also comes from Australia.\n- Fungus under the nails: This is a special problem, and quite difficult to solve. It may\ntake six months of careful work before results begin to be seen. The fungus is generally\nunder one or more toenails, and causes them to warp out of shape.\n- Potassium permanganate is the remedy used on this for decades. This is poison, yet used\nexternally, it seems to be one of the best solutions to the problem. Permanganate is a\npowerful fungus killer! And fungus under the nails demands something very special. The\npermanganate also stains the skin dark brown, so after soaking your toes or feet in the\nsolution, they will not look very pretty. Formula: Soak the feet for half an hour in a warm\n1:5,000 solution of potassium permanganate. Dry the feet thoroughly after use. This is the\nsame formula for athlete's foot, which is a similar fungal foot disease.\n- If you need to prepare this solution at home, you dissolve a slightly rounded teaspoon of\nthe crystals in 8 ounces of water. Keep it in a dark-colored glass bottle. A teaspoon of this\nsaturated solution in a pint of water makes a solution of about 1:1,500 strength; a teaspoon\nin a quart of water makes one of about 1:3,000 strength. With this information, you will be\nable to prepare about any strength you might need.\n- The above is one of the few powerful poisons mentioned in this book. Do not let a child\ndrink it!\n—See \"Ringworm,\" \"Athlete's Foot,\" and \"Candidiasis\" for much more information.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Live to bless others, and you will find a happiness which you have not\nexperienced before.\nTETANUS (Lockjaw)\nSYMPTOMS—Symptoms generally appear within 5-10 days. Possible discomfort at the site of the\nwound. Stiffness on opening and closing the mouth, and the person becomes restless and apprehensive.\nMuscle stiffness and spasms increase and spread to more muscles in the body. The face becomes\ncontorted, and the slightest noise or disturbance produces muscle spasms. Pain intensifies, high fever\nand exhaustion develops, followed by death.\nCAUSES—Tetanus is caused by the toxin (waste product) of clostridium tetani, which normally lives in\nanimal manure.\nPuncture wounds from stepping on dirty nails is the most likely immediate cause. The germ only grows\nwhere there is little or no oxygen. The spores (seeds) were on that nail and, entering the body, begin to\ngrow and multiply. But the spores must penetrate deep enough; they cannot grow if oxygen is present. It\nis the toxin that the growing tetanus produces, which paralyzes voluntary muscle tissue, including the\njaw muscle (the masseter).\nTetanus is not common; but, if contracted, it is extremely dangerous.",

      "overview": "- Squeeze the puncture wound repeatedly to make it bleed. Keep doing this until it bleeds\nfreely. If necessary, cut the area open with a clean, sharp, razor blade. You must get air to\nthe wound and get it to bleed freely.\n- Then wash it well with soap and water; pour in hydrogen peroxide and let it fizz. Get the\nblood flowing again. Then wash the area with pure water, pat dry with a sterile cloth, and\ncover with a bandage.\n- Call a physician. If symptoms of tetanus begin appearing, call a physician at once! It is\nnot too late.\nHere is what nature healers in out-of-the-way places do, when there are no physicians available:\n- Take cramp bark tea in teaspoon doses.\n- Grind up some peach leaves and apply directly to the wound after washing it. Change\nthis raw poultice twice a day.\n- Heat some turpentine and apply to the wound; massage it over the jaw, neck, and spine\nwhen symptoms of lockjaw are suspected.\n- Use 2 cups of wood ashes per gallon of water, and soak the limb or punctured part in it.\nIf the wound is located where it cannot be soaked, apply the ash solution in a fomentation.\nDo this for an hour, and repeat if danger is suspected.\n- If lockjaw actually appears and the person shows stiffening, give 10 drops of\nantispasmodic tincture every 15 minutes until the stiffening is gone.\nThe formula for the tincture is as follows:\n- Into a large-mouth, glass, quart jar, put 1 ounce each of the following herbs (they should\nbe in ground form or you should grind them first): skullcap, skunk cabbage root or seed,\ngum myrrh, lobelia seed (or plant if seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root. Mix\nthem in the jar while dry, and add one pint of pure grain alcohol of 70 to 100 proof; 80\nproof Vodka works well. Let this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shaken well\nonce a day. Then strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all the sediment you\ncan. Keep the tincture in a tightly covered jar. Put some into a small dropper bottle. It is\ntaken internally in 8-10 drop doses.\n- In addition to the above, also give the person lobelia and cayenne. Prepare it by boiling a\nquart of water, take it off the stove, and put a teaspoon lobelia powder and a teaspoon\nground cayenne into the water. Let it stand 20 minutes and drink ¼ cup every half hour till\nrelieved.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Make it the law of your life, from which no temptation or side interest shall\ncause you to turn, to honor God. What would Jesus do if He were here? This is the question to be asked.\nPARROT FEVER (Ornithosis)\nSYMPTOMS—Weakness, fever, chills, and loss of appetite. Dry coughing changes into sputum\ncoughing.\nCAUSES—The primary cause is inhaling the contaminated dust from the feathers, cage bedding, or\nfeces of infected birds. These birds can include parrots, parakeets, lovebirds, canaries, or pigeons. Think\nespecially twice about keeping a parrot or pigeon. But there is danger with the other birds also.\nThe disease gives the appearance of an \"atypical (unusual type of) pneumonia.\" When it first starts, it is\noften misdiagnosed as the flu or confused with Legionnaires disease (which see) or Q fever (which see).\nOnly a blood test can provide a certain diagnosis, but a history of frequent exposure to birds ought to\nprovide an indication of the true nature of the problem.",

      "overview": "- Contact your nearest Poison Control Center and describe the situation to them. Have\nlabels of the product at hand. Every state and many large cities in America and Canada\nhave their own PCC phone number. There is no nationwide number. Telephone the\noperator (0) or emergency (911), and they can direct you to your nearest Poison Control\nCenter.\n- Many poisons are strong acids or strong alkalies. In such cases, the antidote will have the\nopposite pH. But the PCC will know what the antidote should be. The PCC will have even\nbetter data on the substance than will be found on the label of the product. Then contact a\nphysician.\n- If the poison is on the outside of the body, flush with plenty of water. If inside, follow\ndirections on the label if no other information is available.\n- Many poisons can be counteracted by taking an emetic to cause vomiting. (In the case of\ncertain caustic poisons, vomiting is not the best.) Put a teaspoon of salt in 2 cups of warm\nwater and drink it quickly. This will usually produce vomiting. Repeat a second or third\ntime if necessary. Tickle the throat with a finger. After vomiting has occurred, induce\nmore vomiting.\n- If the person has swallowed a caustic acid, swallow soda, chalk, lime water, milk, or\nvegetable oil first to neutralize the acid in the stomach; then induce vomiting.\n- If the person has swallowed a strong alkali, then first neutralize it with lemon or vinegar.\n- Swallow lots of powdered charcoal in water.\n- After swallowing the powdered charcoal, to help heal the stomach, drink a tea of white\noak bark, alfalfa, oregano, or sweet basil.\n- If bits of glass from a broken bottle got into the food and some was swallowed, eat lots\nof soft bread. This sticky dough will tend to wrap around the glass and may help carry it\nsafely through the intestines.\n- Cleanse the body; eat nutritious food. Include lots of fiber, including pectin in apples;\nthis helps discharge metals from the body. Have a hair analysis made. It will tell you how\nmuch you have. Whole grains are all high in fiber. A urine analysis can also identify the\nmetal excess or deficiency.\n- Vitamin A helps the body discharge poisons. Deficiency of vitamin A can cause lesions\nfrom radiation, antibiotics, and metal poisoning. The B complex vitamins protects the\nnervous system and help the liver detoxify the blood. Deficiencies of vitamin B suppress\n6\nthe immune system. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and prevents free-radical damage.\nCalcium and magnesium are natural chelating minerals. Selenium enhances the functions\nof vitamin E. Zinc is a free-radical inhibitor, and helps utilize vitamin A.\n- Herbs which help counteract metal poisoning include Burdock, alfalfa, chaparral,\ndandelion, echinacea, fennel, garlic, juniper, kelp, lobelia, and cayenne.\n- Eat eggs, onions, beans, legumes, and garlic to obtain sulfur to counteract the arsenic. It\nhelps to eliminate the arsenic. But do not take inorganic sulfur into the body! It will\nproduce boils. Only drink distilled water. Drink plenty of fruit and vegetable juices.\n—Related topics in this book include \"Food Poisoning,\" \"Chemical Poisoning,\" \"\"Aluminum,\"\n\"Arsenic,\" \"Cadmium,\" Copper,\" \"DDT,\" Fluoride,\" \"Lead,\" \"Mercury,\" \"Nickel,\" \"Radiation,\" \"Toxic\nShock,\" \"Drug Rash,\" \"Tobacco,\" and \"Toxemia.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—There are many problems which we encounter in life, but only God can help\nus deal with them.

Aluminum was little\nused until the 1940s, when an inexpensive method was found to extract it from Bauxite by running an\nelectric current through that ore. Since then, Alzheimer's has rapidly increased.\nAn excess of either aluminum or silicon in the body results in reduced absorption of calcium and other\nminerals.

      "overview": "CAUSES—It is truly surprising what a high percentage of medicinal drugs are poisonous. But it need\nnot be, when the underlying modus operandi (method by which they work) is understood.\nMedicinal drugs work by introducing a strange new poison into the body. The system immediately turns\nits attention from the debilitated area—and begins fighting the drug. The type of poison (the drug)\nintroduced, and the way it operates, affects the reaction of the body. For example, the body was\neliminating sulphur through a boil but then a drug is introduced, and the boil seemingly \"heals.\" The\nbody has let the boil no longer suppurate, so attention can be diverted to the radical poison which has\nbeen introduced.\nNatural remedies operate in a different way: They clean out the body and restore it to a healthy\nnormalcy. Whether it be fresh air, pure water, nutritious food, simple herbs, or water treatments, the\nnatural remedies assist the body in carrying on its work of cleansing the body. For that is what \"dis-ease\"\nis: an effort of nature to cleanse the body of impurities and eliminate the effects of enervation.\nA drug is a foreign substance of a poisonous nature. The healing herbs are not \"drugs.\" It is true that\nabout five of every 100 herbs is poisonous, but natural therapy only uses the safe ones. The poisonous\nones can be purchased at the drugstore or grocery counter (tobacco, coffee, black tea, chocolate, black\npepper, digitalis, quinine, etc.). Such things as aspirin, valium, phenobarbital, dilantin, morphine, etc.,\nare foreign chemical substances of a poisonous nature. They all produce dangerous side effects, called\n\"contraindications.\"\nIn contrast, the safe herbs are the ones you eat (all your worthwhile vegetables) and use for treating your\nills. They were given us by the God of heaven (Genesis 1:29).\nMost of the damage that drugs inflict on the body is beneath the skin, but drug rashes are effects on the\nskin.\nHere are but a few examples of drugs which produce drug rashes:\nAntipyrine: Papular, erythematous rash, sometimes accompanied by edema and much irritation.\nArsenic: Papular or erythematous rash, sometimes urticarial. Prolonged use may produce pigmentation\nof skin.\nBelladonna: Erythematous rash, usually accompanied by intense itching.\nBromides: Usually like acne vulgaris. Sometimes erythema.\nChloral: Papular erythema.\nIodides: Usually papular erythema, sometimes with acne-like pustules.\nPhenolphthalein: Macular rash, sometimes purpuric.\nQuinine: Very irritable erythema or urticaria.\nSalicylate: Erythematous rash, possibly morbilliform.\nSerum: Usually urticaria.\nSulfonal: Erythematous or urticarial rash.\nHere are some other drugs which produce skin rashes: opium compounds, acetanilide, amidopyrine,\nbarbiturates, ephedrine, novocain, sulfanilamide, and other sulfa drugs.\nSome of the drugs have been given very nice-sounding names, but note the chemicals in them: calomel\n(mercurous chloride), green vitriol (ferrous sulfate), goulard water (lead lotion), oil of vitriol (sulfuric\nacid), and vermilion (mercury sulfide). Most drugs are compounded from, not two but, a wide range of\nextremely complex and very poisonous chemical mixtures.\nLet it be emphasized that most drugs work their damage in a thousand other ways in the body, without\nproducing skin rashes.",

      "overview": "SYMPTOMS—A continual craving for tobacco in some form.\nIf the person smokes, there is irritation and inflammation of throat and lungs, chronic cough, chronic\nbronchitis, and premature aging of the skin. This eventually leads to lung cancer, high blood pressure,\nosteoporosis, emphysema, respiratory ailments, heart disease, stroke, and/or many other diseased\nconditions and cancers. Women will have intensified problems with menstruation and menopause, and\nmen will have greater prostate trouble. Women who smoke age twice as fast as other women. Their skin\nrapidly ages; and the result is a dull, lifeless, gray, deteriorating complexion, and wrinkles.\nIf one chews tobacco, there is irritation and inflammation of the lips, mouth, teeth, throat, and\nesophagus. This eventually leads to cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, and\nother diseases.\nCAUSES—Nicotine is remarkable for the vast number of harmful chemicals it naturally contains, and\nthose which are added to it during growth or processing of the leaves. Nicotine is also remarkable for its\naddictive qualities. It ranks with heroin, and some who have been hooked on both declare it to be worse\nto quit than heroin. Like heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, tobacco gives a sense of relaxing while making\nthe heart pump harder (12-25 beats per minute faster), causing palpitations and a generalized feeling of\nanxiety. For the smoker who takes the last puff before bedtime, the circulatory system is only normal 2\nhours out of every 24.\nEach cigarette destroys 25 mg of vitamin C; a full pack in one day eliminates more of this vitamin than\nis in the diet.\nIn America alone, tobacco causes 35% of all cancer deaths, 78% of all fatal heart attacks, 18% of deaths\nof all kinds, 85% of lung cancer, and 85% of obstructive pulmonary disease. More Americans die each\nyear from smoking than from alcohol, illegal drugs, traffic accidents, murder, or suicide. Those coffin\nnails shorten lifespan by at least 15-20 years. These are some of the blessings you get from the nicotine:\nlead, carcinogens, cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and over 5,000 other irritating\nchemicals in tobacco. Tobacco not only injures you, but it also damages those around you: your spouse,\nyour children, your unborn, and fellow workmen. Did you know that the breath of a smoker contains\nslightly more nicotine than the side smoke from his cigarette? Men and women who smoke are\nconstantly exhaling air into the room for their children to breathe.",

If\nsupplementary treatment is given, the crisis can be weathered easier, and with less\nlikelihood of a return to smoking.\n- In order to quit, it is best to accompany a firm decision with a cleansing program. This\nhelps speed up the elimination of stored-up nicotine and other poisons. The quicker this\nhappens, the faster the cravings cease.\n- A nutritious diet must be adhered to. Carrot juice and citrus juices are very helpful.\nVitamin C is important.\n- Take the tobacco pack or can and throw it away. In its place put a candy bar. Blood\nsugar level is a factor in the addiction. When the cravings are successful gone, throw away\nthe candies.\n- Take extra calcium and eat chamomile 3-6 times a day. Both will help relax during the\nwithdrawal period. Vitamin B complex is also important for the nerves.\n- Lobelia contains lobeline, which is similar to nicotine. It is non-addictive, but helps a\nperson quit tobacco. Here is how to use it in aversion therapy:\n- Only smoke one hour each day, at which time 15 drops of lobelia, diluted in water, are\nswallowed every half an hour and then 15 minutes before lighting the first cigarette. With\neach 15-minute period, an additional 15 drops are added to the water to drink—while the\ncigarettes are smoked. The result will be nausea, which the person will associate with the\ncigarettes. This kills the desire for the cigarettes.\n- If the lobelia method is not used, the alternative must be a definite quit all at once\napproach. See the author's book.\nHYDRO—Here are suggestions from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):\nHeating and Sweating Packs are also used for the elimination of nicotine from the body, which lessens\nthe physical craving for more tobacco (p. 64).\nThe Steam Bath is also useful in tobacco addictions (p. 131).\nEliminating the tobacco habit: Drop the drug at once. Put him to bed. Sweating procedures (such as\nRadiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath, sweating Wet Sheet Pack), twice daily; follow with short cold\napplication, as Shallow Cold Bath, Wet Sheet Rub, or Cold Douche.

Sugar only increases the hypoglycemic problem. Nourish the system with good\nfood; do not sugarize it.\n- The alcoholic craves potassium.

Regarding the hard drugs, it is best that\nwithdrawal be done under professional guidance.\n- Nutritious food should be eaten along with heavy vitamin/mineral supplementation. Vitamin C and the\nB complex are especially important. Drink lots of water and get extra rest. Take sweat baths, to help\nexcrete poisons.\nHYDRO—The following hydrotherapy methods used for opium, cocaine, and related habits are from the\nauthor's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):\nGeneral: Rest in bed. Sweating baths (such as Radiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath) twice a day for 3 days\nbefore withdrawing the drug. Follow bath by vigorous cold applications. While withdrawing the drug,\nthe symptoms may be successfully combated as follows:\nNervousness, restlessness, \"indescribable sensations\": Prolonged Neutral Bath at 92o-94o F., for 10\nminutes; Neutral Douche at 92o F. for 2-4 minutes.\nCardiac weakness: Cold Compress or Ice Bag over heart; alternate (hot and then cold) applications to\nthe spine; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub, repeating treatment hourly if necessary.\nVomiting: Hot and Cold Truck Pack, Ice Bag over stomach and spine, Hot Leg Pack.\nDiarrhea: Hot Enema after each movement; Cold Compress over abdomen, changed every 30 minutes.\nLocal pain: Revulsive Compresses, alternate or hot and cold Compress.\nInsomnia after withdrawal: Wet Sheet pack; Prolonged Neutral Bath, 20-60 minutes; Heating Leg Pack;\nHot Abdominal Pack; cold Ice Cap.\nGeneral Method: Same as for alcoholism. Withdraw gradually within 2-3 days (pp. 191-192).\n—Also see \"Alcohol Withdrawal\" and \"Tobacco Withdrawal.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Every habit can be resisted and overcome in the strength of Christ.

Surgical removal is done to remove them.\nColon and rectal polyps: These growths in the outlet end of the colon can become cancerous. A\ncolectomy is the surgical removal of these polyps, but is generally done, not by cutting out the polyps,\nbut by removing part of the colon! Sometimes the rectum is left in place and the small intestine is\nconnected to it.

Here are official\nwarning signs of skin cancer:\n1. An open sore that bleeds, crusts over, and will not heal properly.\n2. A reddish, irritated, spot that is usually on the chest, shoulder, arm, or leg. It may itch,\nhurt, or cause no discomfort at all.\n3. A smooth growth with an elevated border and a center indentation. As it becomes\nbigger, tiny blood vessels develop on the surface.\n4. A shiny scar-like area that may be white, yellow, or waxy with a shiny, taut,\nappearance.\n5. An enlarging, irregular, \"angry\" appearing lesion on the face, lips, or ears.\nHere is a description of one of the more common types of skin cancer: large flat, tan, or brown spots,\nwith darker black or brown areas dotted on its surface. The edges may, or may not, be clearly defined.\nThe spot may appear mottled.\nMoles should also be watched—especially those that change in size or color, are irregularly shaped,\nhave ridges around the edges, widen, bleed, itch, or seem to be continually irritated by clothing.\nHere are still more identifiers of skin cancer—the so-called \"A-B-C-D checklist\":\nAsymmetry: Both sides of the mole should be shaped similarly. If the overall shape is\nirregular, then it might be skin cancer.\nBorder: The edges of moles should be smooth, not blurred or ragged.\nColor: It should be tan, brown, and dark brown if it is normal. If it is red, white, blue, or\nblack, it is not.\nDiameter: Any mole that is larger than ¼ inch in diameter, or whose diameter seems to be\nincreasing, should be treated with suspicion.\nSpots which are dry, red, and scaly (most frequently found on the face, neck, or backs of hands) may be\nactinic (solar) keratoses. These are lesions which result from years of overexposure to the sun. They can\nbe precancerous. Later they may become hard to the touch and grayish or brown in color.\nCAUSES—Skin cancer is also called melanoma, or lentigo-maligna melanoma, and appears on body\nsurfaces which are most frequently exposed to the sunlight: the face, neck, arms, and trunk. It can also\noccur on the lips and even eyelids.\nThe best thing about skin cancer is that it is often slow in spreading and invading the deeper layers of the\nskin. As long as the cancer is only on the surface, it can easily be removed.\nThere are three types of skin cancer; the first two are the most common, and the third is the most\ndangerous. Yet all three types can be eliminated if treated early. The medical route or natural methods\ncan be used to eliminate each of these. But, either way, be sure it is gone. As long as it is treated early,\nyou can easily see if it is gone.\nBasal cell carcinoma: This is the most common type, and the slowest growing. It does not spread until it\nhas been present for a number of years. It is an ulcer-like growth which spreads very slowly. The first\nsign is a large pearly lump, generally on the face, nose, or area around the eyes. About six weeks later it\nbecomes an ulcer with a moist center and a hard border which may bleed. Scabs continually form, then\ndrop off, but with no healing of the ulcer. Another form is flat sores which slowly widen. Treatment is\nthe same as for squamous cell cancer.\nSquamous cell carcinoma: Due to damage to lower-skin surface, a lump forms on the skin. Looking like\na wart or a nonhealing ulcer, physicians cut it off, freeze it off, chemical it off, or irradiate it off. A skin\ngraft may be applied afterward.\nMelanoma: This is the most dangerous of the three, and can run in families. It often begins as what\nappears to be a mole. Most people have moles, but be especially beware of those which appear after the\nage of 40. Any mole that is unusual or that changes in size or color should be eliminated. If in doubt, see\na physician!\nA melanoma mole arises out of the deeper pigment layer of the skin. For this reason, it spreads more\nquickly. Melanomas most frequently occur on the upper back and legs. But they may also occur on\nmucous membranes or under the nails.\nA fourth type of skin cancer might be noted here. It is the rare mycosis fungoides. For years there will be\nitching skin lesions. Eventually they become firm and begin ulcerating. Later they involve the lymph\nnodes and produce cancer of the lymph (lymphoma).\nOver 600,000 Americans develop skin cancer each year, and 10,000 die of it. More than 90% of skin\ncancers can easily be eliminated, if done so early.",

      "overview": "- Exposure to the sun is vital to good health. Unfortunately, the ultraviolet rays also cause\nwrinkles and 90% of all types of skin cancer. (It can cause cataracts too.) Yes, continue to\nget out in the sunlight, but try not to overdo it. Keep in mind that, in the early stages, it is\nnot difficult to remove skin cancers; but you have to have a certain amount of sunlight for\ngeneral physical health. Be especially careful between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when sunlight\nis strongest.\n- Those with a family history of skin cancer should obtain their sunlight more sparingly.\n- In the summer, wear light-colored clothing which has a tight weave. Consider using a\nsunscreen of at least 15.\n- Tanning salons are more dangerous than sunlight, because people tend to overdo them.\n- As the ozone layer is gradually destroyed over the north and south poles, those living in\nthe temperate zones throughout the world become more susceptible to skin\ncancer—without even being in the sun.\n- Every month or so check over your body carefully and look for signs of skin cancer.\nThen do something about it.\nSuggestions for eliminating the skin cancer:\n- You can go to your physician, and he will excise it with a knife or an ointment which\nwill burn it off. If you delay, surgery will cut more deeply and, as with all cancer surgery,\nthere is the very real danger that not all the cancer will be removed.\n- Or you can use natural remedies. Fortunately, with skin cancer, as long as it is treated in\nthe early stages, you can tell if it is gone!\n- Garlic is a faithful standby. Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you\nconsider might be, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If you\ncan't avoid it, the skin will redden and burn somewhat.) Russian research, from back in the\n1950s, revealed that garlic is more powerful than antibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also\ncauses moles and skin cancers to fall off.\n- Put the garlic on in the morning; take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening\nbefore bedtime. Put on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the\nprocess. Do this for about 3 days. The mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the\narea heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process at a later time.\n- If you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the\nskin (you will know, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not\nnecessary to slough off the cancer, and could be harmful.\n- The herb, chaparral, works well for skin cancer. Take it as a tea or in tablet form.\n- According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate\namount of essential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancers. It even helps\neliminate them, once they form.\n- Eat a nourishing diet; go off meat and processed, fried, and junk food. Get enough rest.\nRight living helps your body resist and throw off cancerous lesions.\n- Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance; also take vitamin A and selenium.\n- Carcelim is a cream which you can purchase, which requires 30 days to remove the\nmelanoma.\n—Read the sections on \"Cancer\" and \"Cancer Prevention\" for detailed information.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Take your problems to God, for He can help you know what to do. He can\nlead you to solutions which are the best.",

Lung cancer kills\nabout 56,000 women in America each year, and breast cancer is responsible for the death of about\n46,000.\nIt is vital that early detection be made. Discussions of how to carry out breast self-examination are\nreadily available elsewhere and need not be repeated here. As you conduct it, watch for subtle changes\nin the breast. You are looking for special types of lumps in the breast. These lumps are firm, do not go\naway, and are generally pain free. Lumps which do not move around may be malignant or may be\ncaused by normal fibrocystic changes during the menstrual cycle. The experts say a biopsy will detect\nwhat kind of lump it is.\nBut you should know that biopsies can be dangerous. A biopsy is a slice of the tissue which is then sent\nto a lab for microscopic examination. The problem is that slicing any suspected tissue—immediately\nreleases its cancer (if any is present) into the body, where it can more rapidly spread. You may or may\nnot choose to have biopsies made, but you should be aware of this fact.\nYou will often hear it said that \"1 in 9\" women will contract breast cancer—but that is sometime within\na lifetime. The average 30-year-old white woman has a 1 in 5,900 chance of getting it; at 50 years, it is 1\nin 430.\nThere are several different types of breast cancer. Most of them are similar, producing lumps described\nabove. But a few are different:\nPaget's disease of the nipple affects the nipple, and cannot be detected by a self-examination. Cancer\ncells have migrated to the nipple. The symptoms are itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple. This\nform of cancer only occurs when a different form of cancer is present elsewhere in breast tissue.\nInflammatory carcinoma is a different type. The skin thickens and turns red. The breast becomes\nextremely tender and appears infected with something. The lymphatic system and blood vessels have\nbecome clogged because of a tumor. This type of cancer spreads very rapidly. Professionals recommend\na biopsy; but, if you choose not to do so, you must be planning to go on an intense natural remedies\ncleansing, to eliminate the problem. Whatever you do, you had better set to work and do it.",

There are\nthose who have taken the natural remedies route, with the same end results. No one can, or\nought to, decide for you; the decision is yours.\n- In the late 1980s, researchers discovered that women develop breast cancer far more\nfrequently in certain localities than in others. Analyzing those locations, it was discovered\nthat they are those areas where there tends to be less sunlight throughout the year. For\nexample, northwestern California, the western slopes of Oregon and Washington, and the\nNortheast had a far greater number of breast cancer cases than did Florida, Texas,\nArizona, and southern California. The solution: Take sunbaths whenever you can,\nthroughout the year; sunlight is important for maintaining good health, purifying the body,\nand resisting infection.\n- Breast cancer more often occurs in women who started menstruation early in their youth,\nhad a late menopause, gave birth later in life, had a family history of breast cancer,\ndeveloped obesity after menopause, and had a history of alcoholism and eating a high-fat\ndiet.\n- Research indicates that those who take oral contraceptives are 3 times more likely to\ndevelop breast cancer. Silicone (used in breast implants) causes cancer in test animals.\nThose who develop breast, and other, cancers have less vitamin A in their bodies.\n- Eat a nutritious diet centered around fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts.\nEat garlic and onions. Drink distilled water and fresh fruit and vegetable juices. Get extra\nfiber.\n- Do not eat too much soy or peanut products.\n- Avoid meat; dairy products; alcohol; caffeine; nicotine; and processed, fried, whiteflour, and junk foods. Do not take supplements containing iron.\n- You should examine your breasts regularly. Procedures for doing this, and what to watch\nfor, are discussed in many other books.

The prostate makes prostatic fluid which nourishes the\nsperm.\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Americans. Poor diet, exposure to\nenvironmental toxins and cancer-causing chemicals, and overactivity of the sexual organs are possible\ncauses. There is a link between a high-fat diet and prostate cancer. It is believed, by some, that a\nvasectomy may increase the likelihood that this problem will later develop.\nMen over 65 have 80% of the cases of prostate cancer, and 80% of 80-year-old men have it.\nThe younger a man is, when he is diagnosed with prostrate cancer, the worse the outlook. Those with\nrecurring prostate infections are at greater risk. Men whose ancestors had prostate cancer are more likely\nto develop it.

Bloody urine is generally not a\ncancer symptom, but it can be.\nOvaries: Usually there are no obvious symptoms until later stages.\nEndometrium: Bleeding between menstrual periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.\nCervical and Uterine: Bleeding between periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.\nProstate: Weak or interrupted urine flow; continuous pain in lower back, pelvis, and/or upper thighs.\nTesticles: Enlargement of a testicle, lumps, thickening of scrotum, sudden excess of fluid in scrotum,\nmild ache in lower abdomen or groin.\nColon: Blood in stools, rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea and/or constipation).\nLymphoid Tissue: Enlarged, rubbery, lymph nodes; itching; night sweats; unexplained fever and/or\nweight loss.\nCAUSES—In this article, you will find an overview of many research studies and data.\nCancer is now the second most common killer in the United States and is increasing. One in every three\npeople will die from some form of it. Over 1,400 Americans die each day with it.\nCancer cells are wild, irregular, and different from other body cells. They grow rapidly and gradually\ninvade and fill surrounding areas. They rob neighboring cells of nutrition, resulting in a gradual wasting\naway of the patient. They can migrate to new locations and multiply. Wherever they go, there are\nabnormal growths and tumors.\nCancer cells are classified by the organs they initially invade (liver, breast, colon, lung, lip, etc.). There\nare more than 100 different varieties of cancer. Each varies in its symptoms and how fast it spreads.\nThere are four main types of cancer: Carcinomas affect the skin, mucous membranes, glands, and other\norgans. Leukemias are blood cancers. Sarcomas affect muscles, connective tissue, and bones.\nLymphomas affect the lymphatic system.\nEarly detection and treatment is vital. One person dies every 3 minutes from cancer.\nDr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner, stated: \"More is known about the cause and prevention of cancer\nthan most any other disease.\"\nDr. Ronald Raven, Chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, said: \"Seventy-five percent\nof all cancer can be prevented if we utilize the facts we now possess.\"\nAt the Eighth International Cancer Congress, Dr. Kavetsky said: \"It is essential in the treatment of\ntumorous disease, not only to act on the tumor, but to endeavor to strengthen the compensatory and\ndefensive reaction . . of the entire system.\"\nWhen a cancer becomes noticed, it is already far advanced. At this stage, it is important that the one with\nit place himself under the care of a competent physician who understands and uses nutritional therapy.\nHowever, the patient needs to understand, for himself, what is required and what he must do. There are\nsituations in which a cancer victim has no one to help him, and he must carry out such a program\nentirely on His own.\nBut, whether helped by others or going it alone, unless the individual fully cooperates with right\nprinciples, he cannot be successfully helped. He must cease his violations of the natural laws, given by\nGod to mankind, and live fully in accordance with them.\nThe type of food we eat, the way we live, and environmental factors gradually build up or weaken the\nbody. If the organs of elimination cannot keep up with the amount of toxic waste we are producing, in\ndesperation the body eventually turns to the formation of tumors and cancers. Soft cancers are cells gone\nwild because of the excess waste in the system. Hard tumors are garbage cans prepared to hold the toxic\nwaste.\nCancer generally has a lengthy incubation period of years. Nourishing the body, building up the immune\nsystem, and avoiding excess and debilitating substances enables the body to resist cancer.\nBecause of intemperate living, eating, sleeping, combined with stress, the body is weakened over the\nyears. This produces a chronic autointoxication—poisons have accumulated in the body. Vital organs,\nwhose job it is to purify and eliminate wastes (such as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bowels),\nbecome less active and efficient. The system becomes poisoned. These poisons accumulate around the\nweakest organs or where the body has been injured by a bruise, fall, or blow. The accumulated poisons\nfrom years of tea, coffee, tobacco, cola, meat, liquor, fried food, etc., especially accumulate in such an\narea. Then the body either tries to build garbage cans (tumors), to hold the waste products or the cells in\nthat area go wild from the irritation; so cancer cells form and spread. It is well-known that irritation,\nsuch as always picking at a certain spot, can cause cancer.\nUnfortunately, there are also toxic substances in the air, water, and soil. This makes it the more crucial\nthat we live as carefully as we can.\nPrevention of cancer requires effort; yet many people give more attention to caring for their prize dogs\nor their new cars. The human body requires careful attention also.\nDrs. Hans Nieper and Dean Burk stated that, by the time the tumor is present, a patient's malignancy is\nalready far advanced. As noted earlier, a tumor is something of a strange parasite, which has as little as\n2% of normal blood circulation. Its cells are living on sugar fermentation instead of oxygen as normal\ncells do. It is more like a plant or fungus.\n—Additional causal factors will be noted in Cancer Prevention.\nHere are two interesting facts: (1) The U.S. Government declares that the five-year survival rate from\ntaking the officially authorized cancer remedies (chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation) has not changed\nover the past 20 years. (2) Statistics reveal that patients who do not take officially authorized therapy\nwill, as a group, survive longer than those who do.\nA problem with the cut, burn, and poison routes is their deadly nature. Chemotherapy, for example,\nproduces hair loss, extreme nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, sterility, and damage to the liver,\nkidneys, and heart. What should you do? That is your decision. On one hand, you can take the officially\nrecommended remedies at your local hospital. Or you can try natural remedies. Your choice.\nSome of the natural folk remedies are listed here. There are many others.\nHowever, you should know that the government and the medical association advises that you should\nnever treat yourself for cancer. Their counsel is that you consult a medical doctor (M.D.), and follow his\nadvice explicitly. Not to do so, they say, could result in your death.",

Ader,\nPsychoneuroimmunology, 1981). Strong stress in a child can also lead to it (B.L. Bloom, et. al.,\nPsychological Bulletin 85 no. 4, 1978). Adults who who had recently lost a loved one, or were widowed,\ndivorced, or separated, have the highest cancer rates (B.L. Ernster, Journal of the National Cancer\nInstitute, 63, no. 3, 1979).\n- Ronald Grossarth-Maticek, M.D., a European researcher, spent 20 years working along a line of study\nwhich has been rejected by orthodox medicine. His concept is called Creative Novation Behavior\nTherapy, and it concerns people with certain personalities; that is, having certain mental-emotional\nattitudes, are the most likely to contract cancer.\n- Grossarth-Maticek is a Yugoslavian oncologist (cancer specialist) who used mortality data in\nHeidelberg, Germany.\n- People who view life in a certain way are more prone to develop cancer.\n- Type C persons are unable to solve problems in relationships with other persons, situations, and goals.\nWhen relationships are crushed, circumstances go back, or goals become unachievable, these people\nreact by sinking into a depression, characterized as feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Type C\npeople are highly prone to cancer.\n- Type H persons also have the same difficulties named above, but they react quite different to such\nproblems. Instead of feeling hopeless and helpless, they become angry and frustrated. Type H people\ntend to develop heart disease.\n- Type F persons learn how to roll with the punches. They are free of fears and worries, for they give\nthem into God's hands to care for. Although they encounter problems as others do, they trust in God,\nrecognize their own limitations, and, when difficulties arise, keep moving forward cheerfully. This type\ntends to die of other causes, such as accidents. They tend not to die of cancer or heart or circulatory\nproblems.\n- These people are not living under stress, with aroused hormonal flow, such as type 1 and 2\npersonalities have. They are at peace with life. They accept what has to be, change whatever they can\nchange, and, with God's help, keep cheerfully on their way, helping others as they go.\n- Still other researchers have found other aspects of this Type C (cancer-prone) personality.\nThe main aspect they have noted is loss, either loss of a loved one, or loss of hope. Many cancer patients\nfeel a profound sense of helplessness and despair, particularly about the meaning of their existence.\nFrequently, they need peace with God.\n- A second characteristic is the suppression or repression, of emotions.\n- The third factor is loneliness. Such people tend not to have close friends. (H. Dreher, Your Defense\nAgainst Cancer, 1988, 246-247.)\n- All three factors could be nicely resolved if such individuals would come to God and find in Him the\nencouragement, the forgiveness, and strength they need to meet life's difficulties.",

Add to that a seventh: the immune\nsystem, working together with the white blood cells, the T-cells, and vitamin C. (Vitamin E also purifies\nand detoxifies, but it carries on this function in the liver.)\n- The first step is to cleanse the blood by relieving constipation, making all the organs of elimination\nactive, and keeping them active. Take herbal laxatives or enemas.\n- A daily bowel movement is essential, even if an enema or colonic is required. All foods which\nferment in the bowel should be avoided. Absolutely no meat or fish!\n- Bowel movements need to be complete evacuations, even if enemas are necessary. The cleansing\nprogram is releasing so many toxins, it is important that they be flushed out. Enough water must be\ndrunk every day.\n- If necessary, keep the bowels clean with herbal laxatives or enemas. When the body is toxic, the\nbowels become sluggish; waste matter is reabsorbed by the blood and lymphatic system, which is\ncirculated throughout the body and stored in tumors or other trash sites. It is best that you not use these\nover a long period of time.\n- Many aspects of cancer therapy, including chemo and radiation therapy, pain killers and sedatives,\nreduce muscular contractions in the intestines, resulting in constipation. Sometimes physical assistance\nis needed. Using the flat side of your fist, gently massage with rocking motions, pushing about 1-2\ninches. Be gentle and slow! This not only helps reduce constipation, but increases muscle tone.",

      "overview": "- Coal tar dyes are highly carcinogenic. All artificial colors, flavors, and odors are made from coal\ntar. You will find them in all soft drinks, cosmetics, and many medicines. Foods which have bright\ncolors, strong flavors, or odors often have coal tar in them. (The FDA lists thousands of approved food\nadditives. The more natural and unprocessed the food is, the less likely it is to have additives. Junk foods\nare the worst.)\n- Research has shown that cyclamates, an artificial sweetener, will in later years cause cancer of the\nstomach and other digestive organs. Ditto for saccharin.\n- Food additives like MSG, BHT, BHA, DES, and others are poisons. Read the labels carefully. Keep\nin mind that many harmful food additives are not listed on the labels because the FDA considers them to\nbe \"Generally Regarded as Safe\" Those chemicals you will find in the FDA GRAS List. But that does\nnot mean they are safe!\n- Diethylstilbestrol (Des) has been shown by the FDA to cause cancer of the uterus, breast and other\nreproductive organs. This is an artificial sex hormone widely used in food production. Dangerous\nresidues of stilbestrol are in 85% of all the meat sold in the United States. This is the main reason why\n15 countries around the world now refuse to import American meat; 21 nations have a total ban on the\nuse of stilbestrol in food production or processing.\n- Nitrosamines cause cancer of the liver, stomach, brain, bladder, kidneys and several other organs. Dr.\nWilliam Lijinski, of the University of Nebraska, says they are \"perfect carcinogens.\" When chemical\npreservatives and color enhancers are ingested, they cause the body to produce nitrosamines. Another\nsource is nitrates and nitrites, which are heavily added to meat during processing. Runoff of nitrates and\nnitrites from fields sprayed with chemical fertilizers get into aquifers and wells and, when the water is\ndrunk, can lead to cancer.\n- Yes, aluminum cookware is a type of \"food additive!\" Throw it all away. It is poisonous to your\nbody. It is outlawed in Sweden; outlaw it in your kitchen. Aluminum is a poison, and also a relatively\nsoft metal. Particles of it gradually melt into the food you are cooking. That is why it remains so shiny\ninside!\n- Use only stainless steel or glassware for cooking.\n- Be very careful that you rinse all the soap off your dishes and pots, or you will have added an\nadditional chemical \"food additive\" to your next meal.",

Widely used in maternity and other hospital wards, as well as in cosmetics\nand deodorants, \"hex\" is a powerful cancer producer.\n- Chemicals encourage the formation of free radicals in the body, which may lead to cancer. Do not be\naround or use chemicals. The body has to work to throw off the chemicals, when it should be attacking\nthe cancer cells.\n- Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzidines, aniline dyes, and napthalenes, tends to promote\ndevelopment of bladder and kidney cancer.\n- Exposure to asbestos, nickel, chromates, pesticides, herbicides, and radioactive materials induces\nlung cancer.\n- Aflatoxins (found especially in peanuts and soy sauce) must be avoided.\n- Avoid amines (which are in cheese, meat, and unrefrigerated foods).\n- Antibiotics predispose to cancer. This would include tetracycline, penicillin, aspirin, diuretics,\nimmunosuppressants, Azolid, Butazolidin, Presamine, Tofranil, Sk-Promine, Tapazole, Methotrexate,\nantihistamines, amphetamines, Atromids, etc.\n- Aspirin inhibits lymphocytes (white blood cells) which are crucially needed in immunological\ndefenses.\n- No medicinal drugs ever healed anything; it is nature which heals. Drugs are given to shock the body\ninto healing itself. A poison is introduced, and this rouses the body to a supreme effort to throw off the\npoison. The result is generally a weakening of body organs, a transfer of the site of disease to a different\nlocation, and sometimes a smothering of symptoms—till a later, more deadly, form emerges.\n- The taking of birth control pills, estrogen, and other female hormones is damaging to the body. A\nlater result can be cancer. One anticancer physician (Gerson) found that the only cancer patients he\ncould not recover were those who were taking hormones or who had damaged livers.\n- The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported (May 1972) that pregnant women who take hormones can result\nin cancer in their daughters when they enter their teens. The rate of leukemia rate is highest in affluent\nareas, where medical help can be afforded and lowest among poorer people.\n- City living is depressing. It is also unhealthful. The carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and\nother photochemical pollutants in city smog definitely cause cancer of the lungs. Smog is somewhat\npresent in rural areas, but the thickest in the cities where it is especially produced.\n- Automobile exhausts and phosphate fertilizers produce cadmium. This trace mineral is very toxic in\nlarger amounts and produces various diseases, including cancer. Cadmium is concentrated in animal\nlivers and shellfish. Avoid both of them.",

But is this\nreally true?\n- It is not easy to arrive at clear-cut answers in this debate, but certain facts should be mentioned:\n- First, some sunlight on your skin is extremely important as a purifying agent. An entire book has been\nwritten about the physical benefits of obtaining some sunlight on your body.\n- Second, you need some sunlight in order to obtain enough vitamin D for your bones. The oils just\nbelow the surface layers of skin are irradiated by sunlight and vitamin D is produced.\n- Third, the author of that special book, Sunlight, by Zane Kime, M.D., is the recognized world authority\non the subject—and in a special section on cancer, he provides 25 pages of detailed information about\nsuntans in relation to skin cancer.\n- Kime declares that sunlight does not cause skin cancer, if the diet is correct! Here, briefly, are several\nof his points:\n- Sunlight can change cholesterol near the skin surface into free radicals, which can cause cancer. But a\ngood diet will eliminate the free radicals.\n- A high-fat diet increases the likelihood of skin cancer. This includes too much oil of any kind in the\ndiet—grease, hydrogenated oil, trans-fat, and vegetable oil.\n- Trans-fat (fat which is not polyunsaturated) stops oxygen utilization by the cell, and leads to cancer.\nLiquid vegetable oil can be up to 6% trans-fat, margarines up to 54%, and solid shortening up to 58%.\n- If you are on a low-fat diet, sunlight hitting your skin actually inhibits cancer.",

Do not eat\nthem at the third meal.

Hospital records show that Seventh-day\nAdventists, who eat little or no meat, suffer far less from cancer than the average meat-eating American.\nDr. Willard J. Visek, research scientist at Cornell University, stated that the high protein diet of\nAmericans is linked to the high incidence of cancer in the U.S.\n- Another cancer physician, who also worked with hundreds of cancer patients, said that anyone who\ndoes not eat meat, eats only good food, and does all he can to protect his liver, may never get cancer.\n- Cancer is less a disease than a condition existing in the whole body.

      "overview": "- Keep the weight down. Obesity is another factor linked to cancer, especially in women. Overweight\nwomen more frequently have cancer of the uterus, and do not recover as easily from breast cancer.\n- Accumulated fatty tissue in the body affects female hormones. The more that is present, the more\nestrogen is produced and converted into a special type of endocrine substance which stimulates cells to\ndivide in the breast and reproductive system. Overweight men and women are more likely to develop\ncancer.\n- A high-fat diet dramatically increases the occurrence of colon, breast, endometrium, and ovarian\ncancer, as compared with a low-fat diet. Eating a lot of fat encourages the development of cancer in both\nmen and women. Colon cancer is more likely to occur in men.\n- Those who eat the most saturated fat are twice as likely to develop polyps.\n- Dr. Ott Warburg, made that discovery in the 1920s. He demonstrated that the metabolism of cancerous\ntissue differs radically from that of normal tissue. A regular cell is nourished by oxygen which it uses to\nbreak down nutriments; without oxygen it dies. But a cancer cell lives by using chemicals to break down\nnutriments—not oxygen—and needs little or no oxygen to exist. The tumor, being a parasite, has a\nrestricted circulation of blood, sometimes as low as 2% of normal, hence it lives on fermentation of\nsugar, like a plant or fungus, instead of oxygen. Later experiments by Warburg revealed that normal\nliving tissue will become cancerous, if deprived of oxygen. It was this research which brought Warburg\nthe Nobel Prize.\n- Since the blood provides the cells with oxygen, Warburg concluded that the condition of the\nbloodstream played an important part in the development of cancer. This is substantiated by the fact\nthat malignant tumors are frequently found near scars, at the sides of ulcers, in atrophied organs, or\nwherever the blood supply is poor.\n- Rancid oils and heavy protein diets thicken the blood, and weaken its ability to transport food and\noxygen to the cells.\n- Unlike other cells, cancer cells do not need oxygen. Rancid oils and fats are dangerous, for they\ndecrease oxygenation and weaken normal cells while strengthening cancerous ones.\n- Rancid food and oils are unsafe and can produce cancer. Even health foods which have been on the\nshelf (not refrigerated) for too long can be rancid. Try to make sure that the wheat germ, wheat germ\noil, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flaxseed oil, and whole wheat flour are fresh. Natural,\nunprocessed foods are extremely perishable. Refrigerate as soon as possible after purchasing them.\nWheat germ is a special problem; it turns rancid a week after it is made. Vitamins E, A, and F are\ntotally destroyed in rancid foods. During the process of turning rancid, very harmful chemicals, such as\nperoxides, are produced. Because they are strong chemical irritants, after being ingested they can cause\ncancer. Research on this was done in Germany by Dr. H. Anemueller, and, in the University of\nPennsylvania, by Drs. Rownee and Barrett.\n- Heated fats (animal or vegetable), when heated to a high temperature, become carcinogenic. Never\nfry food, never eat fried food. Instead add no oil to your cooking, but place measured amounts on your\nfood after it is served at the table. In this way, you will be better able to control your oil intake.\n- Oil in the coffee bean turns rancid when heated; do not drink coffee because of that and several other\nreasons. Coffee has been shown to produce cancer of the bladder.",

The use of alcohol or tobacco leads to\ncancer of the larynx. Smokeless tobacco produces cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, and throat. Smoking\ncigarettes or cigars produces lung cancer and is a factor in bladder and kidney cancer.\n- Do not eat too much salt.

Older women who use generous amounts of sugar\nare much more likely to contract breast cancer. Do not use any cane sugar products, such as cake, pie,\njelly, ice cream, candy, etc.\n- In animal studies, progressive increase in sucrose in the diet leads to a dose-dependent decline in\nantibody production.\n- An epidemiological study of 21 countries revealed that high sugar intake is a major risk factor toward\nbreast cancer.\n- Artificial sweeteners are cancer-causing drugs.\n- Do not use China tea (the regular tea you buy in the grocery store); it contains tannic acid. Only use\nherbal teas.\n- Some natural-remedy cancer therapists say never use tomatoes at all, if you have cancer. There is\nsomething about tomatoes that tend to aggravate the situation for those with active cancer.\n- Others say that those with cancer can eat tomatoes by themselves, not with other foods. Some say it is\nall right to make a meal of them if you wish—eaten alone. Some say they can be eaten with fresh-baked\nzwieback (bread which has then been toasted in the oven until it is hard and chewy). Probably the best\ndecision is avoid tomatoes entirely if you have a malignancy.\n- Do not take supplemental iron tablets. The body tries to withhold iron from cancer cells, because the\ninorganic iron helps the cancer grow. People with excess iron levels in the blood tend to have an\nincreased risk of developing cancer, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Excess iron\nsuppresses the cancer-killing function of the macrophages and interfere with T- and B-cell activity. The\nrichest source of good iron is blackstrap molasses.\n- Cancer thrives on glucose. They produce a 3- to 5-fold increase in glucose uptake compared to healthy\ncells. Studies of cancer patients revealed that they tended to eat more sugar than healthy people. It was\nalso found that high sugar intake increases the likelihood breast cancer.\n- Simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose [white sugar]) honey, and orange juice significantly\nimpaired the capacity of neutrophils to engulf bacteria, but starch ingestion did not have this effect.\nHowever, you still need simple sugars, so eat them in moderation.",

Only nutritious foods should be eaten, and in moderation.\n- Overeating is associated in 35% of all cancers.\n- One group of mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted (about 3 g per day); the other was\nrestricted to 2 g. Over half the mice on the unrestricted diet developed cancer after 90 weeks. Later\nexperiments repeated this result, producing all types of tumors (lung, liver, skin, etc.). In every\nexperiment, the more the diet is restricted in calories, the less incidence of cancerous growths.\n- Carotenoids and bioflavonoids are both free radical protectors. Both stimulate the immune system,\nwhile there is evidence that carotenoids may be directly toxic to tumor cells. Carotenoids are the yellow\ncoloring matter in green and yellow vegetables. Deep green leafy vegetables and fresh carrot juice are\nthe best sources. Bioflavonoids are found in citrus, whole grains, honey, and other plant foods.\n- Animals fed cruciferous vegetables had markedly lower cancer rates matched controls.

Since that 1970 discovery the University of Minnesota, the active ingredient, called\nindoles, have been isolated from the vegetables is provides unusual protection against cancer. Scientists\nat Johns Hopkins found that lab animals fed cruciferous vegetables, and then exposed to the deadly\ncarcinogen aflatoxin, had a 90 percent reduction in cancer rates.\n- Greens and the green foods have every known vitamin, except Vitamin D and, possibly, B12. In\naddition, they have high levels of beta-carotene, potassium, glutathione (an amino acid) and other crucial\nnutrients which reduce tumor growth.\n- A diet high in beta-carotene, especially beta-carotene, has been found to protect against cancer\n(International Journal of Cancer, September 1984).\n- Green powders, such as Greenlife, Barley Green, etc., are invaluable. Eat a spoonful with your food or\nin juice.\n- Emphasize raw food to the degree you are able to do so. It is best that most of the food be raw,\nespecially fruits and green leafy vegetables.\n- Phytosterols are natural chemicals in plants which reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n- Abscisic acid is a plant dormancy hormone and vitamin A analog found in plants; it has profound anticancer activity. Abscisic acid is a carotenoid factor and is especially found in green leafy vegetables.\n- While cleaning the body (such as during a fast), breakfast can consist of fresh fruit and fruit juices.

All juices should be fresh, with no sugar\nadded.\n- But in other foods, a small amount of blackstrap molasses, pure maple syrup, or honey can act as a\nnatural sweetener in place of sugar.\n- Use whole wheat or rye in place of white flour. Whole grain products, well-baked, are good. Do not\nuse sourdough bread, sugared bread, or fruit breads. They are too indigestible.\n- Raw fruit and vegetables are best; lightly cooked or steamed are second best. Salt-free frozen are\nnext. Then comes salt-free canned; but such food should only be used if the first three choices are not\navailable.\n- Raw fruit and vegetable juices are needed to clean the system and help rebuild it. Use red beet juice\n(from roots and very little if any from tops) and juice from carrots, celery, grapes, and other\ndarker vegetables and fruits, such as black cherries, black currants, etc.\n- Fruit juices are best taken in the morning and vegetable juices in the afternoon and evening.\n- Drink spring or steam-distilled water only!\n- Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer researcher, uses fresh raw cabbage and carrot juice with excellent results.\n- Some recommend four 8-ounce glasses of freshly squeezed juice daily. Max Gerson, M.D., prescribed\n13 glassfuls a day. Along with a scientific program of other remedies, that juice pattern is still followed\ntoday at the Gerson Institute in northern Mexico.\n- Never mix fruit and vegetable juices in the same meal. It is all right to mix vegetables juices\ntogether, but do not mix fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, or grape). Some (including\nthe Gerson Institute) recommend a combination of carrot and apple juice.\n- Fresh lemon juice should be squeezed on all greens, salads, or lettuce that are eaten. This enables the\ncalcium and minerals to be better absorbed by the system. Dark green vegetables are better than lightcolored lettuce.\n- Lecithin should be included in the diet to keep cholesterol in the blood stream emulsified (so it does\nnot harden on the walls). This will improve blood circulation to the site of the tumor. Lecithin helps\nregulate metabolism, break down fat and cholesterol, and prevent malignancies.\n- Wheat germ oil is an extremely rich source of vitamin E, and should be taken daily. Only use coldpressed (Viobin), and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to use it during the meal.\n- Omega-3 fatty acids may inhibit cancers, especially breast cancer (Cancer, October 1986). Flaxseed\noil is, by far, the best source!\n- According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate amount of\nessential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancer. It even helps eliminate them, once they\nform.\n- Take a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses at the end of the vegetable meal. This will provide additional\namounts of iron, calcium, and important B vitamins.\n- Never eat fruit and vegetables at the same meals. Exception: lemon juice can be squeezed over\ngreens to help you better absorb and calcium and minerals in those greens.\n- Use plenty of soaked figs, prunes and raisins.\n- Eat garlic daily. Studies done in Japan suggest that taking garlic supplements may help reduce the size\nof tumors. It has been used for medicinal purposes for 4,000 years.\n- Garlic is a faithful standby, and protects against cancer in general (Acta Unio. Intern. Contra\nCancrum, 20 no. 3, 1964). Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you consider might\nbe, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If it does, the skin will redden and\nburn somewhat.) Russian research from back in the 1950s revealed that garlic is more powerful than\nantibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also causes moles and skin cancers to fall off.\nPut the garlic on in the morning, take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening before bedtime.\nPut on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the process. Do this for about 3 days.\nThe mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the area heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process\nat a later time.\nIf you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the skin (you will\nknow, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not necessary to slough off the\ncancer, and could be harmful.\n- Be sure to incorporate dietary fiber in each regular meal.\n- Fiber in the diet helps maintain regularity and avoid colon cancer. But it also helps the colon absorb\ntoxins and carry it out of the body. This is important. Be sure to eat at least 3 tablespoons of bran at each\nregular (non-juice only) meal.\n- Try to have a vegetable, fruit, and berry garden of your own, using natural fertilizers, seaweed, etc.\nYou are what you eat. Purchase food where organically-grown food is sold.\n- We do not generally think of mushrooms as the best food, for they are in the fungus family. But it has\nbeen found that three types (Reishi, Shiitake, and Maitake mushrooms) have decided anti-cancer\nfactors. Oral extract of Maitake provided complete elimination of tumors in 40% of test animals, while\nthe remaining 60% had a 90% of their cancers eliminated. Maitake contains a polysaccharide, called\nbeta-glucan, which stimulates the immune system and even lowers blood pressure.\n- Legumes and seed foods (such as soybeans) have protease inhibitors (PI). These tend to protect the\nseeds from being digested. As such, they were thought to be a problem. But recently it has been\ndiscovered that they tend to reduce tumor growth. The National Cancer Institute that some of these\nsubstances (isoflavones and phytoestrogens) have potent anti-cancer properties. However, eating a lot of\nbeans is not something you will want to do at home! Too much protein helps feed the cancer cells.\n- Certain other foods show an ability to slow tumor growth in some way. This includes apples, apricots,\nbarley, citrus fruit, cranberries, fiber, figs, ginger, spinach, and seaweed.\n- There are a variety of digestive enzymes. Take them with a meal to improve digestion, or on an empty\nstomach if the need is to help fight cancer (first thing in the morning, an hour before breakfast; or the\nlast thing at night, at least two hours after supper.)\n- Rice bran, pressure cooked, is rich in tocotrienols. (2-3 tablespoons a day).\n- Aloe vera extract (or, better, fresh aloe vera leaves) contains the active immune stimulant ace mannan.\n- Scientists have found that the active culture of bacteria in yogurt (lactobacillus) can fortify the\nimmune system. In both humans and animals, yogurt in the diet tripled the internal production of\ninterferon, a powerful chemical compound used by the immune system against cancer cells. It also slows\nthe level of natural killer cells. Yogurt slows the growth of tumor cells in the gastro-intestinal tract,\nwhile improving the ability of the immune system to destroy active tumor cells. It also helps block the\nproduction of carcinogenic agents in the colon. Women eating yogurt were found to have less breast\ncancer. It is well-known that milk is one of the worst allergenic foods, and can carry disease germs from\nthe cows. So you would do well to obtain lactobacillus cultures from health food stores, rather than\neating yogurt.\n- Other intestinal microflora products can be used, instead of yogurt (which can be allergenic and\ncontain cow diseases). Some broad spectrum products contain lactobacillus, bifidus, streptococcus\nfaecium. Others contain only lactobacillus, which is milk- and yogurt-free.",

At that point, the body urgently needs good nourishment, as well as cleansing; it should\nnot be given fasts. For further information on this, see the Gerson Therapy, later in this book.\nBut, as a cancer preventative, occasional fasting is helpful. Cancer prevention is theme of this entire Part\nOne section of this book.\n- Fasts on fruit and vegetable juices of 1 to 3 days can be taken. If under the care of someone who\nknows what to do, and you are not thin, a longer fast may be undertaken.\n- Go on a fresh fruit diet for several days. If the patient is thin, after a few days of fruit diet, give him\nan alkaline nourishing diet. This would consist of vegetable broth (simmer thick potato peelings,\ncarrots, and beets; strain; drink the water on top), mashed half-inch thick potato peelings, brown rice,\ncarrots, greens of all kinds, red cabbage, parsley, and other vegetables.\n- Eating good food treats malnutrition, and many people develop cancer because of a lack of the\nprotective, nourishing food needed to resist it.\n- There is a theory that you can starve cancer to death. This has been proven untrue. Cancer does better\nin a malnourished body. One study revealed that pure malnutrition (cachexia) is responsible for at least\n22% and up to 75% of all cancer deaths.",

    "fields": {
      "overview": "IMPORTANT: Throughout this study, when dosage amounts used in research are given, the amounts are\nalways for \"per day\" (mg per day, etc.) G means grams, not grains.\nIMPORTANT: According to the literature surveyed, when overdosage was possible, this was indicated.\n(See vitamins A, B6, niacin, selenium, cysteine, arginine.) Of course, vitamin D overdose can also be\ntoxic, but it is not listed here as an anti-cancer factor. For a variety of reasons, beware of taking much, if\nany, iron supplements.\nIMPORTANT: Fish oils have also been recommended in the literature as possible anti-cancer agents. But\nwe do not list them here for three reasons: Large amounts must be consumed to be beneficial. Fish oil\nhas a known history of damaging the muscle of the heart. Some forms inhibit blood clotting\nTake the supplements, which seem distasteful and hard to swallow, and put them in a fruit or other drink\nand swallow them all together. If necessary, briefly whiz the mixture in a blender.\nWhen possible, chew the tablets. Break open the capsules and pour the powder onto your food or into a\nspoon. Crack liquid capsules in your mouth, and spit out the capsule. Do not crack vitamin C in your\nmouth—the acidity can hurt your teeth. Just swallow it whole.\n- It is well-known, by biochemists, that most cancer victims have a deficiency of not only all vitamins,\nbut also hydrochloric acid, potassium, magnesium, iodine, and many trace elements.\n- Vitamins are very important. Do not trust yourself to the official standardized amounts of needed\nvitamins and minerals. The actual nutritional requirements are much higher. In addition, living in our\nchemicalized, polluted age destroys a number of vitamins and minerals.\n- For example, vitamin C is destroyed in its effort to combat auto exhaust fumes and mercury in the\nfood. Vitamin E destroys itself in the process of detoxifying cadmium (which nonsmokers breath in\nwhen they are in the same room as smokers). The list goes on and on. The world is not as safe now as it\nused to be. We can be thankful that we are aware of vitamins and minerals and how to obtain them in\nsufficient quantities.\n[Special note: The following data on vitamin A was compiled from information gleaned from sources\nwhich had not yet discovered that beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) was the more active agency in cancer\nprevention, and far more powerful than vitamin A.]\n- Vitamin A is crucial in cancer therapy, but can you get too much of this oil-soluble vitamin? High\ndoses of vitamin A (500,000 IU) can have acute reversible effects. Toxicity may start as low as 25,000\nIU in those with impaired liver function (caused by drugs, hepatitis, or protein malnutrition) Otherwise,\nit begins at several hundred thousand IU.\n- Toxicity of vitamin A can be reduced by taking vitamin E at the same time. This mitigates lipid\nperoxide effects.\n- Toxicity of beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A, as found in greens and carrot juice) has never been found.\nOne 15-year study involved immense beta-carotene intake.\n- Experiment after experiment has revealed that when vitamin A is missing, cancer can be started in\nanimals; but, when it is present in abundance, not even fast growing implanted cancers will not survive\nin test animals. Vitamin A inhibits the induction and retards the growth of both malignant and nonmalignant tumors. Taken over a short period, vitamin A can greatly aid in recovery of cancer. Take large\ndoses (up to 150,000 units per day or you may wish to remain with smaller doses: 50,000 units, twice a\nday). Later you can reduce this to a smaller amount.\n- Take vitamin A in emulsified form to minimize liver involvement. Alternate, taking it 2 weeks on and\n1 weeks off. Blurred vision and a soapy feeling in the mouth are signs that the body has too much A.\n(Vitamin A and D, which are oil soluble, can be taken in excessive amounts, so one must always be\ncareful. Never take large amounts of either for too long a time.)\n- In some instances, a person needs to take as much as 300,000 IU of vitamin A. When this must be\ndone, taking 3200 IU of vitamin E will help reduce the risk of vitamin A toxicity.\n- Vitamin A derivatives (retinoids) reverse bronchial metaplasia.\n- Vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene reduce the risk of cancer by radiation and chemical carcinogen\nexposure. Vitamins A,D. and E inhibit oncogenes activity.\n- Varying amounts of Vitamin A were given to different patients with bladder cancer. Those receiving\nthe smallest dosages were the most likely to have recurring cancer (i.e., the cancer return later).\n- The B-complex vitamins help prevent cirrhosis of the liver. This is important because a damaged liver\nhas a 60% greater chance of becoming malignant. Dr. Max Gerson found that to be consistently true.\nTake a B-complex supplement. Also take 3-4 tablespoons of brewer's yeast each day. Do not eat\nbaker's yeast; it contains live yeast and is not good for you.\n- Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner and director of the Max Plank Institute in Berlin, declared that\nthere is a lack of one or more of three B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid) in tissue\nwhich becomes cancerous.\n- In various countries, nearly 200 scientists have reported on the importance of niacin (vitamin B3) in\npreventing and treating cancer.\n- 2 grams of Niacin (B3) daily is recommended as an anti-cancer factor.\n- Niacin has been recommended by the NIH in amounts up to 3000-6000 mg, for lowering cholesterol.\nBut time release niacin is more suspect of causing liver damage; amounts which might do this were not\ngiven.\n- Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal with pyridoxal-5-pyrophosphate (P5P) is helpful in reducing\ndamage from radiation therapy and slowing cancer growth from polyamine synthesis of the tumor.\nEspecially good when a B6 ointment is applied to surface melanoma tumors. It helps prevent respiratory\nand cervical cancer (Nutrition and Cancer, June 1984).\n- B6-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor susceptibility and increased tumor size. In another\nexperiment, animals fortified with B6 and then injected with melanoma (skin) cancer cells, showed a\ngreater resistance to this deadly form of cancer. Studies on humans revealed similar results.\n- Less than 500 mg of vitamin B-6 in humans appears to be safe.\n- Vitamin B12 dramatically augments the tumor kill of vitamin C.\n- A combination of folate (folic acid, a B vitamin) and B12 has been found to reverse bronchial\nmetaplasia (pre-malignant lesions). Folic acid protects against cervical cancer (American Journal of\nClinical Nutrition, January 1982).\n- Pangamic acid is vitamin B15. Many scientists (Warburg, Goldblatt, etc.) believe that chronic\noxygen deficiency in cells leads to cancer cell formation. Pangamic acid increases the body's resistance\nto oxygen deficiency. Remember that cancer cells do not use oxygen and that poorly oxygenated cells\nare the most likely to become malignant.\n- Laetrile (also called amygdalin, nitrilosides, or vitamin B17) is another substance used to eliminate\ncancer. It is derived from apricot pits (seeds). Take two 500 mg tablets of laetrile 3 times a day. It is also\nfound in all fruit kernels, except those of citrus. Other food sources, which contain lesser amounts,\ninclude lima beans, lentils, mung beans, crab apples, peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, cranberries,\nsprouted seeds, and apples (chew up the seeds as well as the apple).\n- Several apricot kernels (i.e., apricots seeds or pits) should be eaten at each protein meal. Six per day\nmay be sufficient. They should be eaten with food or, better yet, with fresh, frozen, or dried apricots.\nThe slightly bitter ones contain more laetrile (also called nitriloside or amygdalin), and are better for\nyou than are the sweet ones. Do not mix the sweet and bitter varieties; there may be an interaction. If\navailable, 100 mg of oral Amygdalin may be substituted.\n- If people regularly ate the seeds when they eat apples, peaches, apricots, they would get enough\nlaetrile. Starting to do this earlier, will help prevent cancer from forming later on.\n- But when cancer is already developing, 500-590 mg of Amygdalin, in solid tablet form, should be\nswallowed at the two larger meals. They should not be taken on an empty stomach.\n- Vitamin C is a powerful aid in resisting cancer and other diseases. Swedish studies, at Karolinska and\nUmea Hospitals, revealed that vitamin C in large doses can be an effective agent in fighting cancer.\n- Vitamin C blocks the carcinogenic effects of most poisons, including nitrates. Vitamin C can be taken\nto bowel tolerance. This means you can take as much as you can, until you begin to have diarrhea. When\nthe body tissues reach saturation on C, the remainder of this water-soluble vitamin is sent into the bowel,\nwhich reacts to the acidity by somewhat runny bowels till the C is gone. Take large doses of 5,000 mg or\nmore a day. It is the most powerful antitoxin known, and can neutralize or minimize the damaging effect\nof most chemical carcinogens entering your body from the air, water, or food.\n- Cancer of the bladder can occur when the amino acid tryptophan is not properly metabolized, resulting\nin oxidation of its metabolites. Vitamin C prevents that oxidation process, and thus blocks cancer\ndevelopment. It is a preventative agent against a variety of cancers (Journal of the National Cancer\nInstitute, 73, 1984).\n- Vitamin C is such a potent cancer fighter, that it is well to here provide additional information:\nDeficiency symptoms include slow wound healing, pain in joints, immune suppression, bleeding gums,\nirritability, and increased risk of cancer. If you take too much at a time, it will cause mild diarrhea within\n30 minutes. Intake: RDA: 60 mg. Usual U.S.: 114 mg. Prophylactic: 500-2000 mg. Therapeutic: 500100,000 mg.\n- Taken in larger doses, Vitamins A and C inhibit hyaluronidase, an enzyme found in cancerous\ntissues.\n- Vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants. When accompanied by the minerals, selenium and zinc, they\nhelp protect against malignancies.\n- Low serum levels of vitamin A and E were common in patients receiving, and responding poorly to,\nchemotherapy. The great danger in using chemotherapy and radiation is the damage, introduction of a\npoisonous conditions, and destruction of anti-cancer vitamins.\n- Vitamin C and beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A) have been found to be effective in reversing cervical\ndysplasia and oral leukoplakia in humans.\n- Vitamins C and K separately showed anti-tumor activity against human cancer cells in vitro, but\nbecame synergistically effective at 2% the regular dosage when used together.\n- A substance in vitamin D, known as 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol has been discovered to be an anticancer factor. But, due to toxicity of vitamin D overdose, must be used only under the care of a\nprofessional. For most of us, it is best to avoid using too much vitamin D, although some is needed.\nSunshine is the best source. (Fish oils can cause heart trouble.)\n- Vitamin E, working with C, inhibits the activity of a growth substance (catalyst) found in cancerous\ntissue. Take up to 1,000 units a day. Vitamins C and E help the body inhibit the activity of the enzyme\nhyaluronidase, found in cancerous tissue.\n- A lack of beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamin E, and B complex in lung tissue may be related to\nlung cancer.\n- Injections of vitamin E, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin (a carotenoid) and algae extract\ndramatically bolstered levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, and reversed hamster buccal pouch tumors.\n- Human prostatic cancer cells in vitro were markedly reduced when vitamin E was added. It helps\nprotect against bowel cancer (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 73, 1984).\n- Vitamin F is the essential fatty acids. Add 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed vegetable oil to each food\nmeal (not juice-only meals). Wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil are the best. Corn oil and soy oil are\nsecond best. Safflower oil is not so good. Make sure the oil is fresh and kept refrigerated when not in\nuse. Never use cottonseed oil (it can cause blindness), hydrogenated oils, lard, greases, or animal\nproducts. The oil in the nuts is good, if the nuts are fresh.\n- Vitamin K helps protect the body against certain cancer-causing substances. Take it with vitamin C to\nincrease its cancer-reducing strength.\n- Quercetin (one of the bioflavonoids which, together, are called vitamin P) increased the cell kill rate\nin cancer cells, which were exposed to hyperthermia (heat therapy) with no negative effect on normal\nhealthy cells.\n- Quercetin reduced cancers in animals exposed to two carcinogens.",

      "overview": "- A Cancer Control Convention, meeting in Japan, reported that the trace mineral, germanium, in the\ndiet is a significant factor in preventing and eliminating cancer.\n- One cancer researcher, who studied in-depth into cancer remedies over the past 150 years, declared\nthat every effective anticancer formula (Glyoxylide, which is the Koch treatment; the Hoxsey herbs;\nHypotonic therapy; laetrile; the Gerson method; Krebiozen; and Carcalon) involves extra amounts of\npotassium. This is very important.\n- Be sure to include a significantly higher intake of potassium. Potassium deficiency is considered by\nGerson, Scott, and others as a primary contributing cause of cancer.\n- Potassium foods include almonds, apples, dried apricots, bananas, beans, beets, broccoli, carrots,\ndulse, grapes, kale, olives, pecans, rice bran, sunflower seeds, wheat bran, and germ. These foods help\nthe body resist and overcome tumors, cysts, and malignancies.\n- Center your diet around potassium foods. Here are more of them:\n- Dried apricots, asparagus, pearled barley, dried navy beans, fresh lima beans, raw beets, sprouted bread\nwith no salt, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, caraway seed, cauliflower, celery seed, small leaves\nof chard, dark raw cherries, dandelion greens, dill seed, endive, unsulphured figs (dried or raw), garlic,\nconcord or emperor grapes, grapefruit, fresh horseradish, fresh lemons, lentils, fresh limes, nectarines,\nokra, onions, oranges, fresh parsley, dried or raw peaches, Bartlett pears, dry or fresh peas, persimmons,\nraw pineapple (never canned), raw plums, dried or raw prunes, raw quinces, raisins, wild or brown rice,\nsage, rolled oats, spinach, squash (acorn, Hubbard, yellow summer), tangerines, raw tapioca, raw turnip\nleaves, and watermelon.\n- Drink potassium broths daily. Prepare them from half-inch thick potato peelings, which are then\ncooked. Draw off the water and drink it.\n- You want foods which are high in iodine and potassium, low in sodium, protein, and fat.\n- Potassium ascorbate (12-20 g) can be taken as a partial potassium supplement. This product includes\nvitamin C.\n- Potassium and magnesium are among the more crucial minerals for cancer recovery. Magnesium\nhelps to stabilize cell membranes and elevate immune activity while potassium plays a critical role in\nmembrane permeability. (Magnesium, 400-800 mg daily from aspartate, citrate, or orotate.)\n- Magnesium protects against cancer in general (Medical Hypotheses, August 1980).\n- Calcium and magnesium have a beneficial effect in helping the body resist colon cancer. Natural\niron supplements help prevent thyroid cancer. (But many iron supplements are dangerous! Take\nblackstrap molasses instead of iron pills.)\n- The New England Journal of Medicine reported that calcium may prevent precancerous cells from\nbecoming cancerous. Calcium protects against colon cancer (American Journal of Epidemiology,\nSeptember 1988).\n- Calcium supplements (2000 mg) provide a marked suppression of rectal cancer proliferation. It\ninhibits early stages of colon cancer in genetically vulnerable individuals.\n- Iodine and trace minerals are crucial. You can obtain them by each day eating some Nova Scotia\ndulse or Norwegian kelp. Both are special seaweeds which have a wide spectrum of trace minerals. Food\ngrown on the continents does not have all those trace minerals; rainwater has gradually depleted the\nsoils.\n- Iodine protects against breast cancer (Lancet, April 1976).\n- It is very important to keep the iodine level of the blood normal, so both the thyroid and body tissues\nwill have proper cell oxidation. Eat a sufficient amount of dulse, or kelp, each day. (Do not use\nCalifornia kelp.)\n- People with myxedema, or underactive thyroids, are more prone to developing cancer. So keep your\nthyroid in good condition with seaweed.\n- Japan and Iceland both have low goiter and breast cancer rates. This may be because their diets are rich\nin iodine and selenium. Breast cancer has been linked to an iodine deficiency. Japanese women have\nalmost no breast cancer. Colon cancer rates in Japan are also low.\n- Studies at the University of Zurich and in London Polytechnic revealed that brewer's or food yeast\ngives improved resistance against cancer development. Brewer's yeast is one of the best sources of\nselenium, an important anticancer mineral.\n- Selenium made the headlines, at the end of 1996, as a special trace mineral which could dramatically\nreduce cancer in the human body. It completely inhibited tumor growth in mice inoculated with tumor\ncells.\n- Selenium helps eliminate cancer in five ways: It improves detoxification, bolsters immune function,\ndirectly toxic to tumor cells, and may is a valuable anti-proliferative factor (Lancet, July 1983).\nSelenium intake should not exceed 2500 mcg (2.5 mg) per day.\n- Using selenium as a sole therapy, there was a 38.8% favorable response rate in patients with oral\ncancer.\n- High doses of selenium (equivalent to 54 mg in humans) resulted in 83-90% reduction in rate of tumor\ngrowth in mice.\n- Long-term usage of 5000 mcg of selenium may result in fingernail changes and hair loss. Selenite is\nmore toxic than selenium bound to amino acids (i.e., selenomethionine). Ingestion of 1-5 mg/kg body\nweight of selenite will produce toxic side effects. This is equivalent to 65,000 mcg in a 65 kg adult.\n- Chromium as picolinate is very helpful in working with carcinoma. (400-800 mcg.)\n- Zinc as zinc picolinate (30-100 mg) is also a significant help. It protects against prostrate cancer\n(British Journal of Urology, October 1983).\n- Cesium is neither essential nor toxic in cancer reduction. But it slightly alters the pH of cancer cells,\nrendering them more vulnerable to immune attack.",

      "overview": "The information in this section is primarily for medical researchers, but it is also invaluable for those\nwho want to prevent cancer from gaining a foothold in their bodies.\nBecause of modern nutritional, environmental, and living conditions, cancer rates are rapidly increasing.\nIn this chapter, the thoughtful reader will have learned a number of things which can help prevent the\noccurrence of cancer.\n- You have been a toxic waste site! And now, before the cancer has a chance to start, you are beginning\nwaste disposal operations. With prayer, diligent work, and the blessing of God, you can have success.\n- While some are concerned with treating symptoms, you must be concerned with getting at the causes\nof cancer and eliminating them. Only then can the problem be permanently solved.\nThe Gerson Therapy seems to do the best job of eliminating the toxins. You will find it discussed later in\nthis book.\n- Well, there you have a number of possible suggestions. What you have just read may seem like a lot of\nwork. But, since cancer will generally mean the end of you, are you sure you do not want to work?\n- It is extremely important that you care for and rebuild the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, bowels, and other\norgans. Dr. Max Gerson maintained that he could eliminate cancer in anyone if the liver was in good\ncondition. Take care of your liver.\n- If you have cancer, we recommend that you locate a physician and place yourself under his care. A\ncareful, systematic regime of healthful recovery is needed, and you may not know what to do.\nRegardless of which doctor you go to, while waiting for appointments get started doing the right things!\nDoctors may be busy, but your life depends on changes which need to start right now. Essentially\neverything, listed here in Part One of this book, you can do at home to improve health and help prevent\nmalignancies.\n- Do not fear. Trust your life to God; obey the Ten Commandments by faith in Christ; and step forward,\nliving your best and doing your best. Entrust the outcome to God.\n- America alone spends $800 billion yearly on physicians and hospitals; yet it is 23rd in the world in\nlevel of health, vitality, and longevity. Surely, it is time that we start thinking for ourselves.\n- All information in this section, and throughout this book, is offered purely for educational,\nresearch, and experimental purposes—as an objective report, not as a recommendation or\nendorsement.\nHarvestime Books Resource Library\nhttp://www.remnant-prophecy.com\nhttp://www.Harvestimebooks.com\nhttp://www.bible-sabbath.com",
