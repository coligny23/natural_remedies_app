• Eat a light nourishing diet with adequate vitamins and minerals. Much of it should be
raw. Leafy, dark green vegetables and garlic are important.
• Do not eat meat, and avoid alcohol and nicotine!
• Make a gallon of goldenseal tea (stronger than you would drink); and, after straining out
the herb, put the leg in it for an hour. When finished, let it dry for 10 minutes; apply olive
oil in, and around, the ulcer. Dust a little powdered goldenseal on it. If needed to keep out
insects, put a light gauze bandage over it while letting the air in. It will heal, but slowly.
As much as two months may be required.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God is pleased when we keep our faces turned toward His Son, Jesus Christ,
our only Saviour. When we are in trouble and pressed down with anxieties, the Lord is near. He bids us
cast all our care upon Him, for He careth for us.

Skin
Part 3
Skin Spots

SYMPTOMS—Open sores which develop on poorly appearing skin areas of the legs.
CAUSES—Leg ulcers occur when the blood circulation to the legs is inadequate. Skin tissue tends to
erode and ulcers can form. Individuals with varicose veins, thrombophlebitis, or other conditions caused
by poor circulation are most likely to develop this problem."
disease-digestive-indigestion,Indigestion,"TREATMENT
• Correct everything, pertaining to the above paragraph, that you can.
• Get more rest at night, rest a little before the meal, and walk outside immediately
afterward.
• Drink carrot and beet juice.
• A primary cause in older people is achlorhydria (low hydrochloric acid production).
Take natural digestive aids, such as papain from papaya or bromelin from pineapple.
• See ""Dyspepsia"" for much more. Look up the following articles which apply to your
case, for additional information: ""Belching,"" ""Bloating,"" ""Heartburn,"" ""Vomiting,"" and
""Achlorhydria.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Father appreciates every soul whom His Son has purchased by the gift of
His life. Every provision has been made for us to receive divine power, which will enable us to
overcome temptations. Through obedience, through Christ's enabling grace, to all God's requirements,
the soul is preserved unto eternal life.

(Dyspepsia)
SYMPTOMS—Gas, abdominal pain, a bloated feeling, belching, nausea, rumbling noises. Sometimes
vomiting.
CAUSES—Dyspepsia is probably the most common ""disease"" in the Western world. Ongoing
indigestion can lead to food allergies, osteoporosis, anemia, degenerative disease, and a debilitated
immune system.
Dietary habits and stress are primary causes of this problem. Other causes include (1) overeating, eating
too fast, not chewing food well, eating when fatigued; (2) too much cooked food and not enough fresh
food, not enough fiber in the diet; (3) partaking of coffee, tea, soft drinks, alcohol, and using nicotine;
(4) eating foods you are allergic to (see ""Pulse Test""); (5) eating when nervous, distressed, angry,
fearful, etc.; (6) and a lack of hydrochloric acid."
disease-digestive-enlarged-stomach,Enlarged Stomach,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
DIETARY FACTORS—Aseptic diet; avoid overeating, frequent eating, and gas-forming foods. Also
drink large quantities at once. Give very simple dry dietary of well-cooked cereals or a liquid diet, such
as buttermilk, purees, or gruels prepared from nut creams, etc."

every 2 hours. During the intervals between, apply Heating Compress at 600 F., changing every 30
minutes. Hot Foot Bath; Hot Leg Pack.
VOMITING—Ice Bag to epigastrium; Hot and Cold Compress over stomach; Hot and Cold Trunk
Pack; ice to spine opposite the stomach.
PAIN—Revulsive Compress to area of pain, 10 minutes every hour. Heating Compress during interval
between.
FEVER—Hot Blanket Pack, 20 minutes, followed by Cold Half Pack; Prolonged Neutral Bath; Cooling
Wet Sheet Pack, following a Fomentation over stomach.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid Cold Full Baths and general Cold Douche."
disease-digestive-gastroenteritis,Gastroenteritis,"TREATMENT
• Begin by giving the person activated charcoal: Each dose should be 4 capsules, 8 tablets,
or 1-2 tbsp. of powder, stirred into a glass of water. Give a dose each time there is
vomiting or diarrheal stools.
• Keep him in bed and give a clear liquid diet during the acute stage while there is nausea
and vomiting. Throughout the day give small amounts of water, fruit juices, or ice chips,
to help restore lost fluid.
• Do not give junk beverages (colas, black tea, coffee, or alcohol), for they will only
irritate and intensify the symptoms.
• When vomiting and diarrhea cease, give small amounts of non-irritating food, such as
cooked rice, plain cooked potatoes, cooked carrots, bananas, or apple sauce.
• Avoid processed and greasy foods; avoid milk and high-roughage foods.
• Do not be quick to let him up from bed, for the vomiting and loss of fluids may have
weakened him.
• Especially in small children and infants, watch for signs of dehydration. These signs
include drowsiness, rapid respiration, and dry skin and mucous membranes. This is
important.
• Mix 1 tsp. of catnip tea leaves in a cup of water, steep for 15 minutes, and drink while
warm. This is very soothing to the digestive system. If it is vomited up, give again
immediately; it is more likely to be accepted and kept down the second time.
• If fluids cannot be kept down, then give small saline enemas, to replace lost body fluids.
Using 1 level tsp. of salt per pint of water, inject 1-2 oz of the solution into the rectum
(using a small rubber bulb syringe). Then hold the buttocks together for several minutes.
Do this every 1-2 hours until improvement is seen, and he is able to take fluids by mouth.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God has a heaven full of blessings that He wants to bestow on those who are
earnestly seeking for that help which the Lord alone can give.

(Stomach Flu)
SYMPTOMS—Nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and muscle aches. Acute symptoms
generally last only 24-72 hours.
CAUSES—Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. This includes both the
stomach and intestines.
It is usually caused by viral (sometimes bacterial) infection, allergies, stress, chemical irritation, or
medicinal drugs. Antibiotics are a frequent cause, and weaken the body so the virus can attack.
This disease is contagious, so be careful. Wash hands frequently, sterilize cloths, etc."
disease-digestive-chronic-gastritis,Chronic Gastritis,"TREATMENT
• For rapid pain relief, drink a large glass of water. It dilutes the stomach acids and flushes
them out.
• Avoid all situations resulting in tension, stress, irritability, nervous strain, anger, or fear.
Complete rest and relaxation from pressing problems and worries is needed.
• Do not eat fried foods, tea, caffeine products, salt, chocolate, animal fats, strong spices
or soft drinks. Do not drink cow's milk. Do not smoke (if you do, do not expect the ulcer
to heal properly).
• A diet high in sugar increases HCl production. White bread also causes more HCl to be
made.
• In earlier years the recommended treatment included frequent feedings, milk intake, and
a bland diet. But this approach is being discarded.
• It is now known that the calcium in milk only stimulates acid production rather than
decreasing it, as was taught for years. (Milk does initially neutralize HCl, but the calcium
triggers gastrin, which causes the walls to excrete more HCl.)
• In addition, it is now known that sipping milk and cream can lead to myocardial infarcts
(heart attacks). The problem seems to be the butter fat in the sippy diet.
• The bland diet approach is also being discarded because those foods neither relieve pain
nor speed healing. So, instead, eat whatever good food works best for you.
• Potatoes are very helpful. They are soothing and have an alkaline reaction.
• Vitamin U is the anti-ulcer vitamin. It is specifically for peptic ulcers. Raw cabbage juice
and alfalfa have the most. Boiling destroys this anti-ulcer factor, and wilted cabbage
contains less vitamin U. Drink fresh, raw cabbage juice immediately after juicing.
• Eat plenty of dark green leafy vegetables. If symptoms are severe, eat soft foods
(potatoes, squash, bananas, yams, etc.) Put other vegetables through a blender.
• If you have a bleeding ulcer, add some psyllium seed to the food.
• Well-cooked white rice and millet are good.
• Eat several small meals.
• Do not eat between meals. Doing so slows emptying of the stomach, and thereby
increases HCl amounts in the stomach.
• Chew food slowly and properly.
• Also helpful are flax, German chamomile, licorice, catnip, bayberry, goldenseal, hops,
valerian, and myrrh.
• Exercise neutralizes stress. Maintain a daily program of out-of-door exercise.
• Make sure the bowels move daily or take cleansing enemas.
• Do not take antacids or painkillers, such as aspirin. That only increases the problem. The
calcium carbonate in the antacids doubles the amount of HCl production. The aspirin
causes the stomach to bleed!
• Do not use medicinal drugs.
• For peptic ulcer pain, apply an ice bag to the abdomen just above the navel. Or place it
on the spine between the shoulder blades.

# STOMACH-ACID SELF TEST
STOMACH-ACID TEST—Is your hydrochloric acid (HCl) production low or high? You have a
stomach ache, but is it caused by too little HCl, or too much?
1 - When you have the stomach pain, take a tbsp. of lemon juice. If this makes the pain
leave, you probably have too little stomach acid, not too much. If it makes your symptoms
worse, then you have an overacid stomach.
2 - Do you crave sour foods, such as citrus and sauerkraut? Do you like grapefruit juice?
If you do, and they set well on your stomach, then you are underacid. If you do not like
acid foods, then you may be overacid. If it does not matter, you are probably normal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Those who make God their strength, realize their own weakness—and God
supplies them daily with the help they need. This help is for you, just now, as you come to Him.

PEPTIC ULCER—1
(Gastric Ulcer, Stomach Ulcer; Duodenal Ulcer)
SYMPTOMS—Chronic burning or gnawing stomach pain, which often begins 45-60 minutes after
finishing a meal or at night. Drinking a large glass of water or eating food relieves it. Vomiting or
swallowing something quite alkaline also does. The pain sometimes awakens the person at 1 or 2 a.m.
Pain just beneath the breastbone is a frequent symptom of an ulcer. Sometimes it radiates to the back.
The pain is often considered to be heartburn or an empty stomach.
Other symptoms may include headaches, a choking sensation, lower back pain, itching, and possible
vomiting.
CAUSES—Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers occurring in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers
occurring in the top part of the small intestine. However causes and treatment are essentially the same.
These ulcers can be caused by wrong food or too much food. They can also be induced by severe
nervous and mental stress.
The walls of the stomach pour a powerful acid into the stomach (hydrochloric acid, or HCl). This
powerful fluid is needed to digest protein. Although the walls of the stomach are protein, they are not
normally disturbed by the fluid. But when there are problems with people or with the food—then trouble
can begin.
The stomach acids begin digesting the walls of the stomach, because too much HCl is being produced;
protective mucous, in order to protect the walls, is not being produced; or both.
These ulcers can occur in the esophagus, but generally occur in the stomach or small intestine.
Gastric ulcers (peptic ulcers in the stomach) occur 2½ times more often in men than in women, most
frequently in the 40-55 age group.
Duodenal ulcers (peptic ulcers in the small intestine) occur in the first 11 inches of the small intestine,
and are caused by excess HCl from the stomach. These ulcers are found in men 4 times as often as in
women, and most frequently between 25 and 40 years of age. Duodenal ulcers occur 10 times more
often than gastric ulcers. As much as 15% of the U.S. population have ulcers, but only about half are
diagnosed. Some are not discovered until the person begins vomiting blood. Ulcers especially occur
during the spring and fall, and tend to run in families.
Many factors affect stomach-acid secretion. Stress and anxiety increase it. Aspirin, steroids, anti-
inflammatory drugs, and smoking—all increase HCl production.
When you have stomach pain, drink some lemon juice. If the pain gets worse, you have too much acid in
your stomach.
Hypoglycemics tend to produce too much HCl and are in danger of eventually having a peptic ulcer.
If you vomit blood or have ""coffee-ground"" stools, then the ulcer is bleeding. You are in danger of
bleeding to death—go to a hospital immediately."
disease-digestive-hepatitis,Hepatitis,"TREATMENT
• Give the patient the type of care for any infectious disease, except that one should keep
in mind that some of these hepatitis cases can be highly contagious.
• Give hot fomentations over the liver area for 15 minutes, followed by a cold sponging,
concluded by a shower. Do this 4 times each day.
• Most cases of hepatitis are self-limiting and will heal with rest and supportive care.
• Avoid sugar, fat, and alcohol.
• Vitamins B and C are important.
12
• He should have bed rest until the acute stage is past; also he should have initial liquid
fasting, followed by a light diet. The patient often has a poor appetite and does not feel
like eating, even though he should.
• Drink plenty of water, avoid constipation. He should bathe frequently, and wash his
hands with soap after every bowel movement. The toilet seat should also be washed after
each usage.
• He should not prepare food for others, and his own utensils should be sterilized after
each of his meals.
• His linen and clothes should be washed separately.
• In China, 10% of the population have hepatitis at any one time. That is 100 million new
cases each year. As one might expect, the rate of liver cancer is quite high there.
• A word to the wise: Gay men often take jobs working in restaurants; yet they have a high
rate of hepatitis B and C infections, both of which do not reveal symptoms for weeks or
months, during which they can, and do, transmit the infection to customers through food
they handle. Something to think about the next time you want to eat in a restaurant or café.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Only those who read the Scriptures, as the voice of God speaking to them, are
the true learners. They tremble at the Word of God; for, to them, it is a living reality.
JAUNDICE—1
SYMPTOMS—The whites of the eyes yellow, then the mucous membranes, and then the skin
generally.
CAUSES—When, for various reasons, the liver cannot handle the load placed upon it, bilirubin builds
up. This is a yellow-brown substance which results from the breakdown of old red blood cells. The liver
must constantly remove bilirubin from the blood; and, if this is not done, bilirubin begins collecting in
tissues all over the body, the urine is darker, and the stools are lighter because the bilirubin it usually
contains is not present.
But red blood cell destruction can also cause it. Blood tests identify whether the problem is obstruction
or RBC destruction.
Jaundice is not itself a disease, but rather a symptom of one. It can point to pernicious anemia, hepatitis,
cirrhosis of the liver, and hemolysis (which is an abnormal destruction of red blood cells). Jaundice can
also be caused by a blockage of the bile duct system in the liver, because of gallstones or a tumor. More
rarely, it is caused by a parasitic infestation, such as tapeworm, hookworm, a flea, or mosquito carrying
a viral infection.
• Eat only raw fruits and vegetables for a week. Then eat 75% raw foods for a month.
Take fresh lemons daily during that time.
• Both alcohol and tobacco are very hard on the liver.
• Drink fresh vegetable juices.
• Treatment includes exposure to ultra violet light in order to speed up elimination;
vitamin C, to bowel tolerance; and vitamins A, E, and selenium.
• Silymarin, extracted from the milk thistle, helps repair damage to the liver. It is well-
worth taking.
• Go on a liver flush. This is done by drinking apple juice alone for 3 days, followed by
drinking a cup of olive oil and a cup of lemon juice.
• Helpful herbs include burdock root, agrimony, celandine, red clover, licorice, dandelion,
and chionanthus.

SYMPTOMS—Weakness, nausea, headache, vomiting, fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite,
drowsiness, dark urine, joint stiffness and pains, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, light-
colored stools, and often jaundice (a yellowing of the skin, which will first be noticed in the eyes and
mucous membranes). Skin rashes and itching may also occur; the latter is caused by excess bile salts
under the skin.
CAUSES—Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, and may be caused by a virus, bacterium, or toxic
substance. But, in most instances, the cause is viral. There are actually several main types of hepatitis:
Hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis): Transmitted by contaminated water, milk, or food, it has an incubation
period of 15-45 days. The contagion is highest just before illness begins, so food workers can transmit
the disease. Hepatitis A is contagious from 2 weeks to 1 week before the illness starts. It is easily spread
by person-to-person contact and through contact with food, clothing, linens, etc. It can be transmitted
from animals. Eating shellfish is a good way to get it, even if the waters they live in pass national
standards. Recovery generally occurs within 4 weeks. Chronic cases are less likely to occur.
Hepatitis B (serum hepatitis): Found throughout the world and spread as HIV is—through contact with
infected blood (contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusions) and sexual contact. Six cases have
been traced to contaminated acupuncture needles. About 5% of all Americans and 85% of gay men have
it. Hepatitis B is very serious. It has an incubation period of 28-160 days (2-6 months), and recovery
may require 6 months. All during that time, it can be passed from one person to another. In increasing
numbers, cases are reverting to chronic active hepatitis, which can result in liver cirrhosis and death.
Hepatitis B is the ninth major killer in the United States.
Hepatitis C: Contracted in the same manner as HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C may take 6 months to
produce symptoms, yet all that time it can be spread from one person to another. Between 20-40% of all
hepatitis cases are of this type. It accounts for 90-95% of all hepatitis transmitted by blood donations.
Hepatitis E, hepatitis non-A, and hepatitis non-B also exist, but are of lesser significance in North
America. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is in epidemic proportions in Africa and Asia, and is
becoming a serious problem in Mexico. It is generally contracted from drinking sewage-contaminated
water. Such water should be boiled before using.
All of the above are primarily viral forms of hepatitis. But there is also one which is caused by toxic
chemicals. It is called toxic hepatitis. The amount to which the liver was exposed to the poisonous
chemicals, fumes, drug, etc., determines the amount of damage to that organ.
Overall, there are 40,000-70,000 reported, new cases of hepatitis each year in America. But the experts
suspect that there are probably ten times that many which go unreported. It most often occurs in young
adults, and is highest in teenage girls.
Hepatitis A is decreasing, and hepatitis B is rapidly increasing. It is fourth among the 30 leading
communicable diseases."
disease-digestive-gallbladder-inflammation,Gallbladder Inflammation,"TREATMENT
• All eating must be stopped. Take nothing but water for 2-3 days until the acute condition
is past. Drink only distilled water.
• Then go on juices for several more days. Pear juice and beet juice are very helpful.
Apple is also good.
• Then add solid food, such as shredded raw beets with 2 tbsp. olive oil, fresh lemon juice,
and freshly blended, uncooked applesauce. Pears should be eaten generously; they are
very healing to the gallbladder. Oil is necessary in the diet, to stimulate the production and
elimination of gall and the fat-digesting enzyme, lipase.
• Using only high quality vegetable oil helps keep gallstones from forming.
• Avoid all meat, grease, processed fats and oils (including margarine and butter).
• It is crucial that you not overeat! Only eat small meals.
ENCOURAGEMENT—No man or woman can be good or great who has not learned to yield his will
to God, and to obey with alacrity. Those who learn to obey are the only ones who will be fitted to
command. God has a special work for your life.
GALLSTONES—1
(Cholelithiasis)
SYMPTOMS—Bloating, gas, and discomfort or indigestion after a heavy meal of rich, fatty food.
When a gallstone passes (a ""gallbladder attack""), the pain can be very severe and last a few seconds or
minutes, and recur frequently for hours or days. Chills and fever may accompany the attack. The
symptoms often occur after the person has eaten fried or fatty foods.
CAUSES—Gallstones may form in the gallbladder or (more rarely) in the bile ducts of the liver. They
may form in the gallbladder as a result of infection or inflammation of the gallbladder wall.
They occur more often in women than men, more often women who have given birth to children,
especially several of them. They are more frequent in obese women, and occur more often after the age
of 40. In the United States, about 10-20% of the population have gallstones.
Persons with diabetes, migraines, cancer of the gallbladder, cirrhosis, and pancreatitis are more likely to
have gallstones.
Gallstones are formed from bile, a brown digestive fluid produced by the liver. Cholesterol (a blood
protein) combines with the bile to form stones. But they do not look like regular ""stones."" Whereas
kidney stones are sharp and crystalline, gallstones are smooth, soft, and gelatinous. They feel like dense
fat. Often persons with them have no symptoms.
But, when they block the exits of the liver or gallbladder, they produce nausea, vomiting, and pain, as
described above.
• Go on a liver flush (which see).
To relieve pain, give a 15 minutes hot fomentation over the gallbladder area, followed by
an ice rub. Repeat the process 3 times. This will reduce the swelling, inflammation, and
pain.
• If you can avoid doing so, do not have an operation on your gallbladder. What they do is
take out your gallbladder, and you really need it.
• Recent studies at the University of Pittsburg found that removing the gallbladder
(cholecystectomy) doubled the risk of colon cancer.
PREVENTING GALLSTONES—Here are several points to keep in mind:
It is an interesting fact that people who do not eat meat, dairy products, or eggs rarely have gallstone
attacks. It is animal fat which tends to form gallstones.
Drinking water helps prevent gallstone formation. It has been discovered that those with gallstones drink
little water.
Drinking a pint of water causes the gallbladder to empty about 10-20 minutes later. This is the ongoing
way to keep the gallbladder cleaned out and in fairly good condition; that is, if you do not eat any fats of
animal origin.
Lack of exercise increases the likelihood of gallstone formation. Cholesterol is excreted more rapidly by
the liver and bladder with more exercise. The truth is that everything works better when you exercise
regularly.
Do not overeat. This is very important.
Do not eat processed, fried, sugared, spicy, or junk foods.
Do not use alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco.
Keep your weight down. Overweight women over 40 who have had several children have the most
gallstones.
Oral contraceptives (and other drugs containing estrogen) increase cholesterol saturation of bile.
Eating eggs greatly increases the likelihood of stone formation. A diet low in vitamin C also does.
Eating lots of refined carbohydrates increase stone formation. Not including enough fiber in the diet
does also.
Taking 2 tbsp. of lecithin each day immediately results in increased phospholipid concentration in the
bile. This directly lowers and disperses gallstones.
Animal protein in the diet increases stone formation; vegetable protein tends to reduce the size of the
stones.

ENCOURAGEMENT—The strength of Christ was in prayer. He went alone and pled with His Father
for guidance and help. Through Christ's enabling grace, we are to do the same. And we can receive help
as Christ did.

(Cholecystitis)
SYMPTOMS—Severe pain in the upper right abdomen, accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting.
The abdomen may be rigid and is usually tender to pressure at, or below, the lower edge of the ribs on
the right side.
CAUSES—The gallbladder becomes inflamed. When it happens, it must be cared for immediately. If
not, you could die.
An acute infection of the gallbladder may be only catarrhal in nature, and recovery will come in a few
days. But, in more severe cases, the gallbladder fills with pus. Be very careful, and immediately treat
this condition. In case of pus in the gallbladder, there may be (and may not be) chills and fever.
Therefore be alert, if chills and fever occur.
The presence of gallstones tends to irritate the lining of the gallbladder. Then bacteria in the bile are able
to invade the wall and cause inflammation.
Inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) produces similar symptoms (plus jaundice) to inflammation
of the gallbladder, but the treatment is the same."

disease-digestive-irritable-bowel-syndrome,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• To relieve GI pain and expel the gas, take an enema, use a heating pad, hot water bottle,
hot fomentations to the abdomen, lukewarm enemas—given slowly. Moist heat will be
more effective than dry heat, since it penetrates better. If the pain is severe, apply the heat
for an hour, remove for an hour, and then apply again for an hour, until relief comes.
• Take charcoal tablets, to relieve gas and bloating. But do not use it daily or it will cause
constipation.
• The pain may be sharply increased by drinking cold liquids and eating food. It is now
known that the pain is generally associated with constipation. (See ""Constipation."")
• The person may think he has too much gas, but studies reveal only that the normal
amount of gas in his intestines bothers him more. But it would still be wise to avoid gas-
forming foods. (See ""Bloating"" and ""Belching."") Avoid swallowing air. Do not chew gum
or smoke, drink enough water, and avoid carbonated beverages.
• Eat more bran (oat bran, etc.) and it will produce more normal bowel movements.
Coarse bran works better than fine bran. A high fiber diet is particularly important in
solving IBS.
• Add crushed psyllium seed to your diet.
• Avoid stress, strain, worry, and rush.
• Avoid tobacco, tea, coffee, soft drinks, alcohol, and drugs.
• Research shows that refined sugar needs to be avoided if you want to return to normal
living.
• Do not use sugar substitutes (sorbitol, etc.).
• Do not take antacids or laxatives.
• Eat on a regular schedule. Do not skip meals or eat between meals. Let your digestive
system rest before the next meal. Five hours between meals is a good rule.
• Do not eat before going to bed.
• Search for your food allergies. Keep written records and take the pulse test. (See
""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test."")
• Avoid animal fats, butter, fried foods, and dairy products.
• Because of the ongoing diarrhea, people with IBS require as much as 30% more protein
than normal, as well as an increased intake of minerals and trace elements. (See
""Diarrhea."")
• Studies of patients revealed that 70% of those with IBS had a lactose-intolerance
problem. They needed to stop drinking milk in order to partially, or wholly, solve the
problem.
• Regular out-of-door exercise is needed in order to maintain good bowel health.
• If you want success, stay totally away from cigarette smoke.
• Do not use medicinal or street drugs if you want improvement.
• When your intestines upset you, temporarily go on a bland diet. Put vegetables and
nonacidic fruits through a blender. But be sure and include fiber if you are on a soft diet,
and some protein.
• Wear loose-fitting clothing.
—Also see ""Colitis.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—There is a great work to be done in our world, and God has a plan just for you.
He has a place for you to work and, though it seems to be ever so insignificant, if you will fill it to the
best of your ability, ever trusting in Him for help, He will approve.

(Mucous Colitis, Spastic Colitis,
Intestinal Neurosis)
SYMPTOMS—There are three basic patterns:
(1) constipation and pain; (2) alternating constipation and diarrhea; (3) and painless diarrhea with
mucous. Diarrhea frequently occurs upon arising, and again following breakfast. For the remainder of
the day, he may be constipated. Diarrhea at night is rare. Instead of diarrhea, stools sometimes are pasty
and very narrow.
Also present may be gas, nausea, bad breath, heartburn, severe headaches, bloating, lack of appetite,
weakness, faintness, backache, and heart palpitations.
Pain is often triggered by eating, and may be relieved by a bowel movement.
A fifth of those with this problem also experience rectal bleeding.
CAUSES—Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common digestive problem which patients see
their doctor about. About one-fifth of Americans have the problem. Primarily occurring between the age
of 20 and 50, women have it twice as often as men. It is said that three-fourths of the population
experience it at some time in their lives. Yet IBS is comparatively unknown in cultures where people eat
simply, and not too much of it.
The fundamental problem is that the muscles of the small and large intestines contract in spasms rather
than regularly. Something in the food bothers the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract,—probably the totality of
the strange things Westerners eat: processed, greasy, fried, sugared, chemicaled, synthetic, drugged, and
alcoholed food; and eaten hurriedly, at irregular times.
These spasms cause the food to pass through the GI tract either too fast or too slow. When too slowly,
too much water is absorbed, causing hard, dry stools; when too fast, too little water is absorbed and the
stools are watery.
Irritable bowel syndrome is a nuisance, but is not life-threatening. But be aware that symptoms of IBS
may indicate more serious problems, which sometimes are related by IBS: arthritis, diabetes mellitus,
gallbladder disease, malabsorption disorders, candidiasis, pancreatic insufficiency, skin disorders, ulcers,
colon cancer, and parasitic infections, such as amoebiasis and giardiasis.
There are diseases which have similar symptoms, such as diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
colitis, and lactose intolerance."
disease-digestive-diarrhea-in-infants,Diarrhea In Infants,"TREATMENT
• Diarrhea in infants can be checked by the use of thin rice or barley water. For an older
child, use oatmeal gruel. This should be given until the looseness is checked.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The plan of salvation, as revealed in the Bible, opens up a way for you to go to
heaven. Do all you can to take that path. Work to save your family.
CRIES OFTEN, INFANT
SYMPTOMS—The infant cries often.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• This is often due to a deficiency of B complex vitamins. But he could also be lacking
other important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.
• Undue stress in the home could be another problem.
• Lack of sleep, fatigue, or constipation may be involved.
• Helpful herbs include hops and skullcap.
ENCOURAGEMENT—In the heart of Jesus there was perfect peace. Trusting in Him, you can have
that peace also.

SYMPTOMS—The infant has diarrhea.
CAUSES—You will want to try to find possible causes. Each time it happens, take note of what
happened that was special or different. Was a new food added? Was the daily scheduling different? Was
there stress?"
disease-general-debility,Debility,"TREATMENT
• Some weak individuals only need rest, fresh air, sunshine, pure water, nutritious meals,
and freedom from worry.
• Some need to clean the toxins from their body. Those who do so, may feel weaker for a
few days, but afterwards will generally feel much better and stronger.
• Over-indulgence in sex is an excellent way to debilitate the body. Worry wears out the
life forces. The use of coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and processed and junk foods are also
sources of trouble.
• Trust in God, obey the Ten Commandments, and live as healthfully as you can.
• A good program of better nutrition, more rest, less tension, and taking time to go
outdoors and work or walk 30-60 minutes at a time will do much to build the body. A cold
morning shower invigorates the body.
• As an aid in rebuilding the body after acute or chronic illnesses, the following herbal
formula is quite helpful. It combines nutritional benefits with herbal tonics:
Mix together 1 oz. parsley root, 1 oz. alfalfa; 1/2 oz. of each of the
following: dandelion root, comfrey root, yellow dock root, burdock root,
nettles leaves, and dulse. Place in an uncovered pot with a quart of water
and simmer for 20 minutes. Let it cool, then strain. Place the liquid back in
the pot and simmer uncovered for one hour or until it is reduced to one cup.
Stir in one cup of unsulphured blackstrap molasses and refrigerate. Take
one tablespoonful 3 times a day.
• A variant method would involve taking the powdered, mixed, dry herbs (not having gone
through the cooking stage), place them in #00 capsules, and take 2-4 caps with each meal.
HYDRO—Here are water treatments, explained in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet),
which will increase endurance: Tonic frictions, which include Wet Hand Rub, Cold Mitten Friction,
Cold Towel Rub, Wet Sheet Rub, Dripping Sheet Rub, Ice Rub, and Salt Glow (WTM, pp. 97-105). In
cases of severe exhaustion, bed rest for a time, proper diet, plus carefully graduated tonic cold
applications, especially Percussion Douche to spine (p. 228).
ENCOURAGEMENT—No one understands as well as Jesus your problems. He is watching over you,
and if you are willing to be guided by Him, He will throw around you influences for good that will
enable you to accomplish all His will for you.

(Weak, Debilitated Conditions)
SYMPTOMS—A feeling of exhaustion all or much of the time.
CAUSES—This can be caused by a number of dietetic, physical, or hormonal problems, some of which
are mentioned below. See ""Chronic Fatigue"" for much more information."
disease-general-emotional-fatigue-syndrome,Emotional Fatigue Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Learn to relax, as well as exercise out-of-doors. Do everything with an attitude of thankfulness toward
and trust in God, believing that He will work everything out for the best.
• Eat high fiber foods, fruits, vegetables, juices, sprouts, grains, nuts, seeds, and beans. Vitamins A, D,
C, and E are important. Take a multivitamin tablet twice a day. Make sure you are getting enough
calcium, magnesium and potassium.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Learn all you can about the laws of health, and obey those laws. Nothing is
apparently more helpless, yet really more invincible, than the soul that feels its nothingness and relies
wholly on Jesus for help. God can help you.

SYMPTOMS—A variety of symptoms could be involved: continual tension and stress, anxiety,
depression, loss of interest, no zest for life, inability to cope with everyday problems, mental and
physical fatigue, loss of confidence, fear of failure, panic attacks, a sense of hopelessness, mood swings,
muscle spasms, sensitivity to noise, negative attitudes, and constant worrying.
CAUSES—Emotional stress depletes the nervous system, weakens emotional stability, and fatigues the
body. Such stress weakens the functions of the body organs (such as the stomach and liver). This in turn
results in malnourishment and a release of toxins into the system. Primary causes would include
constipation, autointoxication, nutritional deficiencies, a negative outlook on people and circumstances,
and negative input from other people."
disease-general-chronic-fatigue,Chronic Fatigue,"TREATMENT
• Obtain adequate rest, exercise, and a well-balanced diet.
• Deficiencies of vitamin B complex, C and D, or iron may cause fatigue. Also needed:
vitamins A, pantothenic acid, B12, folic acid, C, E, iron, calcium, magnesium.
Acidophilus is very helpful to improve digestion and the production of certain B vitamins
in the bowel.
• Exercise every day outdoors. Try to induce some perspiration. Also helpful are ice-cold
foot baths, daily morning bare-foot grass walks, alternative hot and cold showers, ""salt
glow"" skin rubs, and a dry friction rub with a skin brush.
• Helpful herbs include American ginseng, lavender, rosemary, sweet flag, pasque flower.
—Also see ""Epstein Barr Virus,"" which is a different ""chronic fatigue syndrome,"" although having the
same name.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The whole family of heaven is interested in the family here below, and
messengers from the throne of God attend our steps every day. They seek to protect us from our
mistakes, amid the problems we daily encounter. By faith in Christ, obey God's Ten Commandment law,
and know that He will work everything out for the best.

SYMPTOMS—A continual feeling of exhaustion.
CAUSES—Fatigue is a symptom pointing to other problems; it is not a disease itself. Chronic fatigue is
generally caused by a high-fat and refined carbohydrate diet, along with emotional stress. Any of the
following only adds to the exhaustion: drugs, caffeine products, smoking, alcohol, poor eating habits.
Chronic fatigue can forewarn of an undetected problem such as anemia, hypoglycemia, diabetes,
allergies, malabsorption of nutrients, candidiasis, poor circulation, hypothyroidism, Epstein Barr virus
(EBV), mononucleosis, or cancer.
It can also be caused by weight loss, obesity, and, if characterized only by a lack of energy, boredom."
disease-general-epstein-barr-virus,Epstein Barr Virus,"TREATMENT
• Antibiotics do not help since EBV is a virus. Recovery takes time, rest, and good
nutrition. Drink lots of water; at least 8 glasses a day. Regularity in bowel movements are
essential. Add fiber to the diet. Cleansing enemas should be used occasionally. Get plenty
of rest. Do not overexert yourself with heavy exercise.
• Remove from the diet all junk foods, processed foods, fried foods, stimulants (coffee,
tea, soft drinks, sugar), and white flour products (bread, spaghetti, etc.)
• It is said that 60 percent of those with EBV also have candida (see Candidiasis),
therefore it is best to eat some form of acidophilus. Eliminate sugar, alcohol, mushrooms
and all fungi, molds and yeast, fermented foods such as sauerkraut, soy sauce, dry roasted
nuts, potato chips, soda pop, bacon, pork, lunch meats, and all types of cheese.
• Eat some brand of ""greens"" tablets. Chlorophyll is vital to proper diet and healing. Make
green drinks from whizzed up greens and pineapple juice.
• Take no aspirin, since it may induce Reye's syndrome (especially in children).
• Helpful herbs include red clover to cleanse the blood, echinacea to help the glands, garlic
as an antibiotic, and saffron to help reduce pain.
—Also see ""Lyme Disease,"" which has similar symptoms. Also see ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The heart that has once tasted the love of Christ, cries out continually for a
deeper draught. How thankful we can be for His love and care over us.

(Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)
SYMPTOMS—Recurrent upper-respiratory tract infections, exhaustion, extreme fatigue, sore throat,
swollen lymph nodes, achy joints and muscles, memory loss, low-grade fevers, headaches, poor
concentration, night sweats, irritability, and deep depression. Because the symptoms resemble flu and
other viral symptoms, EBV is not always diagnosed correctly. In fact, it is frequently misdiagnosed as
hypochondria, depression, or psychosomatic illness.
CAUSES—Chronic fatigue syndrome is caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). This condition has
become widespread in America. the CDC in Atlanta estimates that tens of thousands of people are
infected with it. Yet they are unaware of it since symptoms are frequently not prominent.
This virus is also the cause of infectious mononucleosis. When mononucleosis occurs, the person
becomes very ill for two to four weeks, or longer if the diet is not corrected. (See ""Mononucleosis."")
EBV is a type of herpes virus, and is related to the viruses that cause genital herpes and shingles.
Keep in mind that chronic fatigue syndrome can also be caused by certain other factors: candida albicans
(yeast infection), anemia, chronic mercury poisoning from dental amalgam tooth fillings, hypoglycemia,
insomnia, and hypothyroidism. (All of the above problems are dealt with in articles in this book.)
Once EBV is contracted, it always remains in the body. Fortunately, most people develop antibodies to
it. The problem occurs when they become run-down and overworked—and then the dormant EBV
strikes. It is more likely to reveal its presence when other diseases are also present, such as arthritis,
lupus, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or AIDS.
EBV causes the body to overreact, resulting in a burn-out of the immune system.
Epstein Barr virus is very contagious, and can be transmitted by close contact, kissing, sharing food,
coughing, and through sex.
Blood tests for antibodies against candida albicans, EBV, HBLV and CMV are available for specific
diagnosis. Yet the fact remains that EBV symptoms are similar to those for many infections, anemia,
parasites, endocrine diseases, and AIDS."
disease-general-candidiasis,Candidiasis,"(Yeast Infection, Candida, Thrush, Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome)
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms include bad breath, constipation, chronic infections, depression, fatigue,
food cravings, gas, headaches, adrenal and thyroid problems, hiatal hernia, indigestion, insomnia, mental
confusion, discomforting odors, panic attacks, and menstrual problems.
CAUSES—This is an infection caused by candida albicans, a normally harmless yeast (saprophyte)
found in your intestines. Some of it is also regularly found in your mouth, throat, and genital tract. But
this organism goes wild when its competitors, the normal bacteria of the intestines, are killed by long
term use of antibiotics. This enables the candida to greatly increase in number.
Stress causes a reduced production of stomach acid, which lets candida enter the stomach—a place
where it normally is never found. As a result, less digested food enters the intestines, much to the liking
of the candida which feeds upon it.
This yeast-like substance proliferates so massively that it enters the blood stream and is carried to many
parts of the body, weakening the immune system and causing various problems.
In the oral cavity, candida is called thrush. White sores may develop on the tongue, gums, and inside the
cheeks.
In the vagina, it results in vaginitis. Large amounts of a white, cheesy discharge and intense itching
occur.
Other effects are food allergies, athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch, and even diaper rash.
Candida is not transmitted sexually, but mothers may pass thrush on to their newborn children. The
baby's tongue will appear red and be covered with white spots (generally appearing 8-9 days after
delivery) that will appear like milk spots. On the buttocks, thrush may resemble diaper rash.
Because their vaginal environment is more conducive to the growth of yeast, diabetic women can
contract candida easier than diabetic men.
You may wish to request a blood test for antibodies against C. albicans. A skin test, similar to a TB tine
test, is also available. A positive result is clear-cut. Unfortunately, a negative one provides less certainty
that one does not have it. Candida is difficult to diagnose, since a culture cannot be used. This is because
this yeast is a normal constituent of everyone's intestines.
TREATMENT—Try to eliminate food allergies, hypoglycemia, any infections, and indigestion.
• Replant Lactobacillus acidophilus. This is the friendly intestinal bacteria which the
""wonder drugs"" earlier killed off. Lactobacillus is a primary competitor of candida for
food in the intestine. Use a retention enema containing 4 oz. warm water and 10 billion
organisms (empty twenty 500,000 organism capsules into the water). Use 3 times weekly,
10 minutes each time.
• Helpful herbs include burdock, echinacea, ginger, golden seal, bee pollen, kelp, lobelia,
passion flower, pau d'arco, psyllium, slippery elm, ginkgo, and suma.
• Useful nutrients include vitamin B complex with extra biotin: 100 mg 3 times a day. /
B12 lozenges: place 2,000 mcg lozenge under tongue 3 times a day between meals. /
Essential fatty acids: Wheat germ oil, primrose oil, etc. / Garlic capsules: 2 caps 3 times a
day. / Multivitamin cap, 2-3 times a day. Take vitamin C up to bowel tolerance.
• Also helpful: vitamin A: 25,000 IU one to two times a day; B6: 100-250 mg one to two
times daily; vitamin E: 400-800 IU daily; biotin; aloe vera juice: 2 oz. four times per day.
• Do not use oral contraceptives while you have candida. Do not use sugary foods. Do not
use cheese, alcohol, chocolate, fermented food, gluten grains (wheat, oats, rye, and
barley). Do not use meat, pickles, raw mushrooms, vinegar, or any yeast products.
• Yeast thrives on sugars and carbohydrates. A vegetarian nondairy diet of protein,
unrefined grains, and vegetables is best. Onions and garlic are very helpful. Fresh, raw
garlic is the best. Avoid meat-based proteins, since these are associated with abnormal
bowel flora development. Avoid yeasted grain foods.
• Avoid antibiotics and steroids, because they destroy the competing bacteria and allow
candida to overgrow.
• Wear cotton underpants, rather than close-mesh synthetic or silk.
• An alternative to douching is the sitz (sitting) bath. Fill a shallow tub to the hip with
warm water, then add salt (enough to make the water taste salty, about 1/2 cup) to match
your body's natural saline state. Add 1/2 cup vinegar to help rebalance the vaginal pH to
4.5. Then sit in the water, knees apart, until it gets cool. The bath will do the cleansing.
Douching can be done with a similar mixture (4 teaspoons vinegar to 1 pint of water).
INFANT THRUSH—Four percent of infants have oral thrush. Keep rubber nipples clean, as well as all
objects going into baby's mouth. If bottle-feeding, boil nipples and bottles 20 minutes after thorough
washing (candida spores are heat resistant). Give plain water to cleanse the mouth after every feeding.
Inspect the mouth before each feeding, and begin treatment if thrush is seen. Swab infected areas with
saturated solution of baking soda 3-4 times a day. Garlic overpowers candida, so it may be swabbed on
the lesions several times a day.
—Also see ""Vaginitis,"" ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Our God delights to do abundantly above all that we ask or think. He will care
for you through this crisis. Trust Him and, by His enabling grace, obey His Scriptures."
disease-general-jet-lag,Jet Lag,"SYMPTOMS—Fatigue, lethargy, irritability, inability to sleep, trouble concentrating and making
decisions, perhaps even diarrhea and a lack of appetite.
CAUSES—Jetting across several time zones produces a sudden violation of your body's inner clocks. If,
from America for example, you fly to Australia or Europe, you will experience jet lag—for you will
suddenly be thrust into meals and wakefulness in the middle of ""your night,"" and awake when your body
tells you it is time for sleep.
DEALING WITH IT—Here are several suggestions, one or more of which may help:
• Get extra sleep beforehand. Drink plenty of fluids and be quiet and relaxed during the
flight. Fly by day, arrive at night—and then soak up some extra rest. Get out in the
sunshine the next day; this will help your body adapt. Obtain some exercise after arriving.
Some people try living by their home clock—but most cannot do that.
• Try to avoid important decisions during the adjustment days. The general rule is that it
will take one day of adjustment for each time zone crossed. So be prepared.
• When crossing only two or three time zones, it is known that going west is easier on the
body than going east. This is because it is easier to get more sleep on arriving, since you
experience more hours that particular day.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We should ever seek to realize that the Lord is very near us. He can help us as
no other one can. Trusting Him and obeying His Word, we can have the help we need.
# TONIC EFFECTS, OBTAINING
HYDRO—Hot and Cold to the Spine (pp. 68-69 in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet)
is a revulsive compress and acts as a strong stimulant and tonic, and is used in a large number of
conditions needing such a treatment.
The Wet-hand Rub, the Cold Mitten Friction, the Cold-towel Rub, the Wet-sheet Rub, the Dripping-
sheet Rub, and the Ice Rub (p. 98, etc.) are all used to increase body circulation and heat. The first four
are the mildest and best.
The Revulsive Shower (p. 129) and Alternate Hot and Cold Shower (p. 130) are also beneficial.
The Sun Bath (p. 143) and Sea Bathing (p. 144) are also good.
The Sun, Air, and Water Bath, Wet Grass Walk, and Summer Spray (pp. 144-145) are equally useful.
Caution should be exercised in giving the above treatments if the patient is frail, diabetic, or has a heart
condition. See that book for much more information.

General Problems
Part 2
Nausea"
disease-general-nausea,Nausea,"TREATMENT
• Use the treatments suggested for motion sickness; especially the charcoal and ginger
root. It is said that powdered ginger root will definitely eliminate nausea. Do not forget the
final solution: Go ahead and vomit.
• Read the article on ""Vomiting."" It will provide very helpful information. It will also tell
what to do if you have been nauseated and vomiting for days.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Angels of God are waiting to show you the path of life. It is outlined in the
Bible, and as you seek, through the grace of Christ, to obey His Word, you will find the strength needed
to meet your problems.

SYMPTOMS—A sick feeling in the stomach, similar to motion sickness.
CAUSE—A variety of things can induce nausea, including nutritional deficiencies, food allergies,
pregnancy, and cancer.
A common cause of nausea is worms or constipation. See both topics."
disease-general-fainting,Fainting,"TREATMENT
• Immediately check the pulse, heart beat and breathing. Often a dash of cold water in the
face helps. Loosen tight clothing, open windows and doors, and have others stand back so
the person can get more air. Use your fist to pound slightly on the back between the
shoulders to stimulate the heart. When able to drink, give him a little cold water.
• If you have it, place 8 drops of antispasmodic tincture on the back of the tongue. If you
know in advance that the person has these fainting problems, you may want to prepare the
tincture and keep it on hand. See ""Antispasmodic Tincture"".
• Sometimes artificial respiration or oxygen is needed. As soon as the person is conscious,
try to find the cause and deal with it.
• If a person has frequent fainting spells, give him an herb tea of mint, skullcap, catnip,
rue, mistletoe, rosemary, and small amounts of cayenne.
HYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy techniques, taken from the author's book Water Therapy Manual (see
order sheet), used on those who have collapsed: Alternate Hot and Cold Compress over the Spine; Cold
Friction; Hot Enema (110o F.); Alternate Compress over the Heart (p. 184); Hot Blanket Pack 15
minutes, followed by Cold Mitten Friction (p. 185).
Heat to neck; short cold application to chest and face. Alternate Compress to spine; percussion of the
chest with the hands dipped in cold water or with the end of a cold towel; vigorous centripetal friction;
rhythmical traction of the tongue (p. 209).
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you have given yourself to Christ, you are a member of the family of God,
and everything in the Father's house is for you. What a promise this is! May we each one prove faithful
to the end.

(Syncope)
SYMPTOMS—The person passes out and becomes unconscious.
CAUSES—Fainting points to some other problem, such as hysteria, epilepsy, insulin shock, heat
exhaustion, lack of oxygen, or anemia."
disease-general-heat-exhaustion,Heat Exhaustion,"TREATMENT
• First, get out of the sun, so the body temperature will not continue to rise and the body
will not lose more water and salt. If you remain in the sun, even though resting and
drinking fluids, your temperature will continue to rise! Do not return to the sun for many
hours!
• In the early stages, drink large amounts of mineral-rich vegetable and fruit juices to
replace water and electrolyte loss in perspiration. Water, by itself, does not replace
electrolytes. Potassium-rich vegetable broths are helpful.
PREVENTION—Plan ahead, so you will not come down with heat stroke later:
• Drink water. Drink diluted electrolyte drinks. Avoid salt tablets. They do the opposite of
what they are supposed to do. The increased salt in the stomach keeps fluids there longer.
• Do not use caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco. The first two accelerate dehydration, and the
smoking constricts blood vessels.
• Over several days' time, adapt yourself slowly to the sun. Do not overexert when out in
it. Avoid working in the mid-day. Wear a hat, and keep on a light-colored shirt.
• Pour water over your head and shirt, especially if the air is not humid. Keep drinking lots
of water.
—See ""Heat Stroke,"" which is different.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We must ever set the Lord before us and trust implicitly in Him. He will guide
and care for us to the end. As we obey His Inspired Writings, we shall have the help we need.
HEAT STROKE—1
(Sunstroke)
SYMPTOMS—The body temperature goes very high (105o F. or more!), sweating is reduced, there is a
strong headache, accompanied by tingling, numbness, confusion of mind and delirium. The pulse
becomes rapid, and breathing is faster. Blood pressure rises.
DANGER—Heat stroke is a serious emergency. If not properly cared for, the person can go into
convulsions, permanent brain damage, and even death.
• You must begin the cooling treatments immediately; do not wait. Be sure to immediately
apply a cold cloth to the head.
• If near a hospital, wrap him in an ice-cold sheet and immediately take him to the
hospital. Continue to apply more ice-water as you travel. Take his temperature at least
every 5-10 minutes, and do not let it go below 101o F. Once below this, you can stop the
ice treatment but monitor the temperature that it continues to move towards normal and
not back up.
• If you are not near a hospital, put him into a ice-cold bath and use fans to aid cooling. If
an ice bath is not available, use a cold stream or lake until medical help can be obtained.
While he is in the cold bath, rub the arms, legs, hands, and feet to increase circulation.
—See ""Heat Exhaustion,"" which is different.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Treat God as your honored Friend, giving Him the first place in your
affections. As you do this, you will have the support and help you need to meet each day's trials and
afflictions.
HEATSTROKE (SUNSTROKE)—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
SUNSTROKE—Increase the body's heat elimination. From a height, pour water (600 F., or less) onto
him while two people rub him vigorously. Give special attention to the spine. Ice Compress to the head
and neck. Continue until the temperature falls to 1010 F.; Cool Enema; cold water drinking when
possible. Ice Bag to the head and neck during the Cold Pail Pour. As soon as the temperature falls to
near the normal point, give a sweating Wet Sheet Pack.
AFTER-TREATMENT—Should consist of daily graduated cold applications (Tonic Frictions) to
slowly build up the body. The head should be thoroughly cooled before each application.
HEAT EXHAUSTION—Hot Full Bath, 3-8 minutes; Hot Blanket Pack; Hot Enema followed
immediately by short Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Wet Sheet Rub, afterward wrapping in warm blankets.
THREATENED CARDIAC FAILURE—Cold bag over heart for 15 minutes every hour; Cold Mitten
Friction every 2 hours; Hot Blanket Pack for 10 minutes, followed by Cold Towel Rub; Hot Enema
followed by Cold Enema; artificial respiration.
- These are all very grave conditions and must receive immediate attention. Immediately call your
physician and begin water treatments.
—Also see ""Heat Exhaustion,"" and ""Heat Stroke (Sunstroke)"".

SYMPTOMS—Thirst is generally the first symptom of heat exhaustion, followed by general malaise,
weakness, tiredness, a loss of appetite, headache, pallor, dizziness, and a general flulike feeling that may
include nausea and even vomiting. Sometimes the heart races and concentration becomes more difficult.
Heat exhaustion is less severe than heat stroke, and may occur over several days out in the sun.
Dehydration may eventually lead to blood volume loss, poor heat regulation, and shock.
CAUSE—Heat exhaustion is generally caused by water depletion (dehydration), and more rarely by a
lack of salt in the diet (salt depletion). When we sweat, we lose both water and salt (as well as potassium
and sodium)."
disease-general-motion-sickness,Motion Sickness,"TREATMENT
• If at sea, lie down and close your eyes. If in a car seat, rest your head back on the
headrest, so it is somewhat faced upward. This relaxes the semi-circular canals.
• Charcoal tablets may help settle the stomach.
• Ginger capsules are highly recommended.
PREVENTION—
• Prevention is the best. Do not eat heavily processed meals, drink liquor, or eat junk food.
Some people do well eating a few whole-grain crackers before and during the trip. Avoid
smoke and food odors. Stay cool, and get fresh air!
• You may wish to take 5 charcoal tabs, one hour before the trip begins. Another method
is 2 ginger tablets every 3 hours, beginning one hour before the trip. Ginger helps prevent
motion sickness, by absorbing acids and thus preventing nausea.
• Some recommend additional magnesium (500 mg, one hour before trip) and vitamin B6
(100 mg one hour prior to trip) to relieve anticipated nausea.
• In order to settle the stomach before a trip, use the nervine herbs: hops, scullcap,
chamomile, and valarian root.
Here are more preventative suggestions:
• Travel at night. When it is dark, what you see conflicts less with what you sense, and the
air tends to be fresher.
• Avoid junk food, smoking, and alcohol. Keep a window open and stay near it, all the
while breathing that fresh air.
• Sit still and do not look around very much.
• Look straight ahead. If you are in the driver's seat, you will sense (and have) better
control of the movements taking place. Do not read while riding. Keep your eyes on
something stationary far ahead.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Provision has been made for us to come into close connection with Christ and
receive the constant protection of the angels of God. Our faith must reach within the veil, where Jesus
has entered for us, and trust Him implicitly for the help we need.

Colds

(Car Sickness, Sea Sickness)
SYMPTOMS—Nausea, excessive salivation, vomiting, cold sweat, queasy feeling, stomach churning.
Possible dizziness, sometimes fainting.
CAUSE—The semicircular canals in the inner ears detect your vertical position. When there is too
much jostling back and forth, movement which you do not have control over (as when riding in cars,
planes, or boats), your sensory system may become overloaded. Since the eyes also sense vertical
balance, when what you see does not seem to agree with what your labyrinthine receptors in the inner
ear sense, then mental confusion results. Nausea occurs when the brain does not know what to tell the
body to do. This weakens the stomach.
The experts say that nausea at such a time also indicates that your liver is not doing well."
disease-general-catarrh,Catarrh,"SYMPTOMS
• Runny nose, headaches, postnasal drip, sore throat, sinusitis, gastritis, glue ear syndrome, and
respiratory problems.
CAUSE—Catarrh is the excess mucus which occurs with many different nasal, throat, tracheal and
bronchial infections; for example, croup and whooping cough.

TREATMENT
• Although excess mucus is normal with some diseases, yet avoiding certain foods will
lessen the amount of mucus produced. Some foods are high mucus-forming. Overcooking
of food is part of the problem. Pasteurized milk, white flour, sugar foods, and meat should
be avoided if you want to cut down on mucus. Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. If you
have cooked food at a meal, begin with raw food. This will help the digestive system
handle the increased load that cooked food places upon it.
• Indigestible food also forms higher levels of mucus in the body. Any specific allergen (a
food or substance toward which you are allergic) may cause catarrh. Orientals are
particularly sensitive to milk products (up to 85% of them lack the digestive enzyme
needed to handle milk sugar, which is lactase).
• Other irritants include fumes, smoke, foreign objects, chemicals, drugs, spicy foods, salt,
pepper, alcohol, and poor food combinations.
• Use steam to break up the catarrh (mucus) so you can sleep well. Eucalyptus oil also
helps. Be sure and drink enough water. As intake decreases, the mucus thickens and cuts
off breathing.
• During the illness, you may drink primarily of fluids (fruit juices) at times. But at those
times when you eat, emphasize a high fiber diet using raw food. When grains are eaten,
they should be whole grains, such as brown rice, millet, and buckwheat. You may wish to
take a psyllium seed and herbal mixture to clean out the digestive tract of mucus. Herbs
for this purpose could include burdock, aloe vera, ginger, alfalfa, cascara sagrada, kelp,
and slippery elm.
NUTRIENTS—Vitamins A, B, complex, C, and bioflavonoids are important. Also needed are calcium,
magnesium, and potassium.
Helpful herbs include chickweed, mullein, plantain, sorrel, white oak bark, bayberry bark, comfrey,
eucalyptus leaves, white pine needles, and oregano.
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is vital that we exercise faith moment by moment, and hour by hour. Only in
the strength of Christ can we be enabled to obey His Ten Commandment law, live clean lives, and
prepare our hearts for a home in heaven.

(Excess Mucus)"
disease-general-chills,Chills,"TREATMENT
• Do warm-ups with clothing covering the head and neck.
• It is very likely that something serious is developing. Immediately start on a cleansing
program. Go to bed, fast on fruit and vegetable juices, or lemon juice. Soak the feet in hot
water, get into a tub of hot water, or take a steam bath.
• Herbs include blue vervain, cayenne, chamomile, oregano, hyssop, skullcap, peppermint,
white willow, and catnip.
—Also see ""Poor Circulation and Chills.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We are to keep our minds stayed upon God; and in our weakness, He will be
our strength; in our ignorance, He will be our wisdom; in our frailty, He will be our enduring might.
———————————————————
# HEAT PRODUCTION, INCREASE
———————————————————
HYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments discussed in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see
order sheet):
To warm up the body: The Heating Wet Sheet Pack, which begins when the warming pack has raised the
body temperature slightly above its usual degree; and ends when general perspiration begins. Once
achieved, for best results this should be continued for about 20 min. (pp. 63-64).
To increase heat production: The Tonic Frictions, which include the Wet-hand Rub, the Cold Mitten
Friction, and certain others (pp. 98-106).
The following listing of heat producing water treatments is arranged from most to the least powerful,
and is primarily composed of tonic and fever-reducing applications: Graduated bath. Cooling Wet Sheet
Pack. Cold Friction Bath. Prolonged Tepid Full Bath at 88o F. Cold Full Bath, followed by a short Hot
Full Bath, Pail Pour, or Shower. Tepid Pail Pour. Cold Pail Pour. Cold Compress. Graduated Compress.
Evaporating Sheet. Cold to head and neck. Cold to spine. Cold to abdomen. Cold over heart. Cold
colonic. Tepid or cold enema. Cold water drinking, a measure that should be combined with all the
others named above. Cold air bath (p. 39).
It is the impression of cold on the thermic nerves of the skin that best increases heat production. The
more intense (and sometimes prolonged) this impression, the greater the desired effect. The most intense
effects are produced by prolonging the application until the temperature of the body has been slightly
lowered. But if the cold is greatly prolonged, or is repeated at short intervals, the heat-rise effect fails (p.
42).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Amid the perplexities that press upon the soul, there is only One who can help
us out of all our difficulties, and bring us peace of heart.

Infections

SYMPTOMS—Sweating, shaking, trembling and unable to feel warm even when bundled up with
blankets.
CAUSES—Chills often occur with flu and other virus infections."
disease-general-viral-infections,Viral Infections,"TREATMENT
• The various chemical drugs (including antibiotics) fight bacterial invasion. But they are
powerless against viral infections. Yet, in contrast, the body uses the same variety of
powerful defenses to resist and overcome both bacterial and viral crises! So help your
body win the battle. The Lord has placed strong defenses against sickness within each of
us. We can claim them more fully if we are living according to the laws of health.
• Vitamins C, A, and B6 are especially helpful. Also see the rather complete list of helpful
suggestions under Common Cold.
• Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant and free radical eliminator. Vitamin B complex and
selenium (500-1,000 mcg/day) are other effective agents.
• Vitamin C (2,000-10,000 mg daily, in divided doses) works in the white blood cells to
produce a powerful antiviral task force.
• Zinc (50-100 mg daily) is also important in adding the body's own immune functions.
• Helpful herbs include echinacea and goldenseal, Garlic is another powerful helper.
PREVENTION—When the invaders are strong and many, and the body is in a weakened condition,
then trouble begins. Keep yourself in good health. Get enough rest, exercise in the open air, and
maintain a balanced, nourishing diet.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God can help you, if you will daily seek Him for that help. Unless we
continually cherish a close walk with God, we will be tempted to separate from Him, and walk alone.

SYMPTOMS—fever, muscular aches, chills, and headaches.
CAUSES—Viruses can be especially serious. Viral infections include the common cold, measles,
influenza, tonsillitis, croup, infectious hepatitis, mononucleosis, asthma, and certain bladder infections."
disease-general-inflammation,Inflammation,"TREATMENT
The treatment is similar to that for the other conditions discussed in this section on Infections.
• Bromelin, taken on an empty stomach and with a small amount of magnesium and L-
cysteine, has anti-inflammatory activity. Calcium, kelp, and alfalfa are also important.
Primarily eat raw foods, and avoid all junk food.
• Charcoal poultices or clay packs are helpful.
• Drink a tea of hyssop, chickweed, vervain, mint, and sage. Read again the section on the
Common cold.
Place a compress of fenugreek or chamomile on the area.
—Also see ""Common Cold.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is ever seeking to draw souls to Himself, but Satan is seeking to draw
them away. We must resist the temptation to separate from our Lord and Saviour. He is the only One
who can help us amid all our trials and needs.
INFLUENZA—1
(Flu, La Grippe)
SYMPTOMS—Prostration, fever, chills, high fever, sore throat, headache, aching behind the eyes with
light sensitivity, abdominal pain, hoarseness, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, aching of the back and
limbs, and frequent vomiting and diarrhea. The person feels cold and shaky, but is sweating. Serious
complications, such as pneumonia, sinus infections, and ear infections, can develop.
The earliest signs are similar to those for the common cold: weakness, headache, and aching in the arms,
legs, and back. He may feel feverish, and then chilly. The flu also generally brings on a dry throat and
cough, and extreme weariness.
CAUSE—Also known as ""the flu,"" influenza is a highly-contagious viral infection of the respiratory
tract. It is easily spread by sneezing and coughing. Individual strains continually change, so vaccines are
not very successful.
There are three main types of influenza: A, B, and C. Type A is the most common; all are air-born and
most frequently spread by droplets (coughing, sneezing, kissing, and using drinking glasses and towels).
Flu epidemics occur every 1-3 years, generally in the autumn or winter. A major epidemic occurs about
every 10 years, because the virus type has changed.
Because it is a viral infection, influenza may appear suddenly after an incubation of only 1 to 3 days
(most frequently 48 hours after exposure). So begin treating it as soon as you can. The quicker you start
treating a physical problem, the easier and more quickly it can be solved. After 2-3 days the fever
usually subsides and, if cared for properly, the other acute symptoms rapidly diminish. But the cough,
weakness, and fatigue may persist for several days or weeks.
• Give fluids (fruit juices, vegetable soups) to replace fluid and electrolytes lost through
sweating, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Drink at least 10 glasses of water a day to keep
lung secretions thin. Give vitamin C to bowel tolerance (3,000 mg or more, spaced
through the day). Also vitamin A and zinc (50 mg thrice daily), and B complex. Vitamin
A protects the lining of the throat.
• Eat lightly and carefully. When it is time to make the transition from liquids to food,
emphasize bland, starchy foods. This would include dry toast (so it will be chewed better),
bananas, applesauce, boiled rice, cooked cereal, and baked potatoes.
• Antibiotics have no effect on the flu virus, and should not be used. Do not smoke, drink
liquor, use coffee, or eat junk food.
• Because influenza can lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia, it is also well to include
echinacea and goldenseal.
• Take an enema at the first symptom. For fever, take catnip tea enemas, plus a 1/4 to 1/2
teaspoon of lobelia tincture every 3-4 hours until the fever drops. This is also for children.
• The eucalyptus oil vapors are also good. (See ""Common Cold."")
• Another worthwhile formula is slippery elm bark powder (1 tablespoon), mixed with
boiling water (1 quart) and honey (half a cup). Put in a jar and give one teaspoon every 3-
4 hours for cough and sore throat.
• Gargle with salt water to help relieve the sore throat (1 teaspoon salt in 1 pint warm
water). Soak the feet in hot water to ease a headache or nasal congestion. Occasionally
breath deeply in and out to refresh and strengthen the lungs, and remove wastes.
• Humidify the air in the room. Make sure the air is warm, but also has a current of air to
keep it oxygenated. But it should not be drafty. (A draft on the patient is defined as
occurring when the skin becomes cooler than the forehead, or the patient is not
comfortable.) Keep warm. Wear warm, close-fitted bed clothes. Back rubs may be given
to increase comfort.
• Helpful herbs include cinchona bark, ginger, eucalyptus, slippery elm, sea buckthorn,
yarrow, white willow, and wormwood.
PREVENTION—Be careful, for influenza is sometimes fatal, especially for children and the elderly.
Those who are not hardy and poorly nourished are especially susceptible. If you have a respiratory
ailment (asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, etc.), solve it as soon as possible. One thing can lead to
another till you are prostrated with sickness. The flu can often lead to ear infections, pneumonia, and
sinus infection.
Children who frequently come down with the flu should be checked for hypothyroidism. Check his
temperature under the arm with a thermometer.
A case of flu is becoming serious if the voice becomes hoarse, he develops pains in his chest, he has
difficulty breathing, or he starts bringing up yellow- or green-colored phlegm. It may be best to see a
physician, if this has not already been done.
—See ""Common Cold"" for how to differentiate between a heavy cold and the flu. Also see
""Influenza—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We must have faith that will not be denied, faith that will take hold of the
unseen, faith that is steadfast, immovable. Christ can help you, right where you are. Not only can He
solve your physical problems; He can guide you all the way to the Holy City above.
INFLUENZA—2 (La Grippe)
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
INCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE AND AID ELIMINATION OF
POISONS—Sweating (Full) Baths, followed by vigorous cold applications (Cold Pail Pours, Showers,
Frictions, etc.); Hot blanket Pack or Hot Full Bath; Hot Leg Bath with Fomentations to chest or spine,
followed by Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub or Wet Sheet Rub; Sweating Wet Sheet Pack.
Copious water drinking; large Enema once or twice daily.
PAIN IN HEAD, BACK, AND LEGS—Very Hot Leg Pack till general perspiration begins, followed
by Cold Mitten Friction, or Cold Towel Rub, keeping limbs very warm.
FEVER—Sweating Wet Sheet Pack and Neutral Bath; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub; copious
water drinking; Cooling Enema.
HEADACHE—Hot and Cold Head Compress, Fomentation to face and especially over eyes (but be
sure eyes are closed and covered with dry cloth).
NAUSEA—Ice Bag over stomach.
VOMITING—Hot and Cold Trunk Pack; withhold liquids.
ENEMA—Neutral Enema after each bowel movement. Cold Abdominal Compress, changing every 15
minutes.
COLIC—Hot Enema; hot Fomentation over abdomen.
INFLAMMATION OF EYE OR EAR—Fomentation over affected part; derivative treatment to legs;

Mitten Friction carefully given and wrapping in dry flannels. Repeat pack twice a day. Fomentation over
especially painful parts, several times daily, followed by Heating Compress in interval between.
GENERAL METHOD—Combat lung and visceral congestion by maintaining warmth and activity of
the whole cutaneous surface, giving special attention to the lower extremities so as to divert blood away
from the cranial and pulmonary cavities. Sweating procedures may be employed with vigor and
frequently repeated if followed by short Cold Frictions given in such a way as to avoid general chilling
of the surface.

Fever

SYMPTOMS—Swelling, heat, pain, tenderness, fever, discharges, edema, and/or allergies.
CAUSES—Inflammation can result from injury, strain, arthritis, bacterial infection, and cancer. A part
of the body is reacting to trauma or infection. Any organ or tissue can become inflamed. When internal,
it is often associated with bacteria.
Inflammation is a reaction of the body to defend and heal itself after something occurs (a bruise or
injury, etc.). Heat, redness and swelling are generally present. When severe, a fever may accompany it.
If not cared for promptly, infection could develop."
disease-general-fever,Fever,"CAUSES
Cholera occurs especially in hot, tropical climates. Filthy living conditions is generally the primary
factor. Bowel discharges from those with cholera must be boiled to kill the germs. When this is not
done, the disease spreads. Flies, cockroaches, ants and mice all carry the disease.
But one cannot get it if he only eats and drinks that which has been boiled. Water and milk must be
boiled. Vegetables and fruits must be washed, and then immersed in boiling water for a few seconds,
then peeled.

TREATMENT
• If the fever gets too high (above 102o F. in adults or 103o F. in children), immediately
immerse the body in tepid water to lower the temperature.
• Other suggestions would include: ice packs on the forehead, running cool water over the
wrists, cool baths and drinking certain herb teas, such as feverfew, cinchona bark, and/or
white willow. Others include meadow-sweet, sea buckthorn, European holly, and
mugwort. A poultice can be made from echinacea root to lower fever. Linden tea can
induce sweating to break a fever. Black elder tea is also good.
• Keep in mind that the fever is not the infection; the infection must be solved, as well as
the fever.
• Vitamin C and lemon juice are especially helpful. Other nutrients include vitamin A, B
complex, B1, D, calcium, potassium, and sodium.
• There is a loss of protein during a fever. Caloric needs are higher, and metabolism is
increased. Greater fluid intake is required. As fluid is lost, sodium and potassium are lost.
Drink plenty of distilled water; also fruit and vegetable juices. It is important that solid
food be avoided until the fever reduces.
• Nutrient-rich juices are especially helpful: beet juice, carrot juice, etc.
• For a feverish child, embed a grape or strawberry in a cube of frozen fruit juice, and let
him suck on it.
• Never give aspirin to children. It can trigger Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal
neurological illness.
• He needs lots of oxygen. Make sure there is a current of air in the room; open the
window. Get smokers out of the house.
• Wet compresses help reduce temperature. Remove them and apply new ones as he heats
the old ones. Apply them to the forehead, wrists, and calves. Keep the rest of the body
covered.
• Cool tap water can be sponged on the skin to dissipate excess heat. Wring out a sponge
and wipe one section at a time, keeping the rest of the body covered. Because of rapid
evaporation, you will not need to dry him with a towel.
• Some people shiver when they have a fever. In such cases, immerse them in a tub of
warm water. This will also lower temperature. For babies, give room-temperature baths.
Sandwich them between wet towels, which are changed every 15 minutes.
• If very hot, remove more covers and clothes; if chilly, add them.
• When signs of fever are gone, be sure to prevent chilling.
• Putting too many clothes on a child can actually cause a fever.
REOCCURRENCE—If feverish flu-like symptoms keep reoccurring; in children this might indicate
diabetes, and in teenagers and adults Epstein Barr virus.
—Also see ""Fever Diseases."" Also see diseases listed under ""Childhood Problems (""Chickenpox,""
""Diphtheria,"" Measles,"" ""Mumps,"" ""Scarlet Fever,"" etc.).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ came so that whosoever believeth in Him may be saved. As the flower
turns to the sun, so our eyes should turn to Him. We dare leave Him, lest we fall away. God can help
you, just now.

—Also see ""Fevers.""
SMALLPOX—1
(Variola)
SYMPTOMS—It takes 12-14 days for the disease to develop after exposure. Several days of discomfort
is followed by a severe chill, intense headache, terrible pain in the back and limbs, vomiting, fever, loss
of appetite, and sometimes convulsions.
Then the fever lowers and the eruptions appear. The pain disappears, but the highly contagious disease
can still be given to others.
The rash of smallpox initially consists of dark red papules, especially on the forehead, neck and wrists.
They gradually fill with clear serum, becoming vesicles, which become depressed at their centers and
then fill with pus (called pustules).
CAUSES—Unsanitary living conditions, and poor diet.
• Call a physician.
• Keep the sick person in bed with the windows darkened, yet maintaining ventilation and
an even, moderate temperature.
• Put him on a fast of juices, give plenty of lemon juice. Follow with a light diet of
vegetable broth, oatmeal water, and fruit juices.
• Give high herb enemas, and clean out the bowels.
• When the skin is hot and dry, give him fluids every hour until there is free perspiration.
• If the fever rises above 103o F., reduce it by means of tepid sponges, and tepid enemas.
• Hot fomentations can partially relieve pain in the legs and back.
• Bathe him with goldenseal root tea, or yellow dock root, or burdock root.
• Open the pustules by pricking with a sterilized needle, about 4 days after they come to a
head. Then bathe them with hydrogen peroxide.
• Bathing the pustules with goldenseal tea will often keep pitting from occurring. Another
formula is to mix goldenseal with Vaseline and apply to the pustules to keep from pitting.
Yet another formula is bathing the skin with a tea of yellow dock root and goldenseal.
—Also see ""Smallpox—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is beyond our power to conceive the blessings that are brought within our
reach through Christ, if we will but unite our human effort with divine grace.
SMALLPOX—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)

continuous cold to the head and the frequently changed Abdominal Compress. In confluent cases,
general septicemia is prevented by Prolonged Full Baths.
- If any of the following related problems exist, see under their respective headings: Broncho-
Pneumonia, Endocarditis, Laryngitis, Nephritis, Inflammation of Eye.
—Also see ""Smallpox—1.""
CHOLERA—1
SYMPTOMS—A few hours or days after contracting the disease, it suddenly begins, often with sudden
cramps in the back, legs, or arms. Often there is severe vomiting. So much fluid is lost that he becomes
extremely thirsty, and the skin becomes dry.
Stools become thin, and contain small, white, curdlike masses.
Some cases of cholera are very light, and have few symptoms other than the diarrhea.
• Call a physician.
• Keep him quiet in bed. Provide fluids to compensate for the vomiting and fever. Diluted
peppermint or spearmint tea is helpful. Have him drink a pint, then put your finger down
his throat and help him get it out. This cleanses the stomach. (If he is too weak, do not do
that.) Then give him a cup of hot peppermint tea to settle the stomach.
• If vomiting of mucus resumes, repeat the process.
• Goldenseal tea is also helpful.
• Give enemas white oak bark, bayberry bark, and wild cherry.
• Give hot fomentations over the bowels and the full length of the spine.
• All stools and discharges should be burned or disinfected. No one should touch what is
used by the patient. Caregivers should wash their hands frequently.
• A diet of oatmeal water or slippery elm water is both nourishing and soothing. Combine
with some soy milk to provide a balanced protein.

ENCOURAGEMENT—If we will but seek God with all our hearts, if we will work with determined
zeal to be a blessing each day, the light of heaven will shine upon us, even as it shone upon faithful
Enoch.
CHOLERA—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION—Secure rest to the stomach and bowels by withholding food. Rest
in bed.
VOMITING—Ice Bag over stomach. Ice pills; Ice Compress to the throat. Fomentation to spine; Ice
Bag to spine; Hot and Cold Trunk Pack.
DIARRHEA—Hot Enema after each bowel movement; Fomentation over abdomen every 2 hours,
duration 20 minutes during interval between Heating Compress at 600 F., renewed every 30 minutes. If
the temperature is above 1020 F., Prolonged Neutral Bath or Hot Blanket Pack followed by Cold Mitten
Friction or Cold Towel Rub.
COLLAPSE—Hot Blanket Pack for 15 minutes, followed by Cold Mitten Friction.
CARDIAC WEAKNESS—Ice Bag over heart.
—Also see ""Cholera—1.""

SYMPTOMS—A fever is an elevation of body temperature above normal. A fever is not a disease, but
a symptom that an infection or disease is present. Fevers are common in a wide variety of diseases, from
mild to severe.
Symptoms include headache, flushed face, body aches, nausea, little or no appetite, and sometimes
diarrhea or vomiting. Skin may be warm with some perspiration, or hot and dry. The elevated
temperature is an effort by the body to burn out infection, and the perspiration helps eliminate toxins.
Therefore a partial fever may be helpful to the body in fighting the infection. If the fever does not get too
high, let it run its course. Many enzymes, antibodies and white blood cell responses are better during
slightly elevated temperatures.
MORE ABOUT FEVERS—Normal is generally considered to be within a range of 97o to 99o F., but it
can vary among individuals. If it is 100o F. or above, it is a fever. One should not have undue concern
unless the body temperature rises above 102o F. in adults or 103o F. in children. Then call a doctor
immediately.
When body temperature is not more than 5o above normal, it does not completely interfere with body
functions. But levels above 105o F. are dangerous; at 106o F., convulsions are common; at 108o F.,
irreversible brain damage frequently results."
disease-general-malaria,Malaria,"TREATMENT
• Call a physician.
• There are two primary ways to treat malaria:
• One way is by taking quinine. This is an extract of the bark of the cinchona tree. Quinine
will generally eliminate the malaria, but a mild to severe hearing loss may also result.
• The other way is to give hot and cold water treatments to the person. This takes work.
The result is equally good, but no hearing loss results.
• During the fever, give cold applications (cool wet sheet packs, sponge him off with cool
water, etc.). During the chills, give him hot applications (hot packs).
• Give goldenseal tea.
—See ""Fevers"" for additional suggestions.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ alone can place our feet in the right path. His perfection alone can avail
for our imperfection. As we seek, by His enabling grace, to obey His Ten Commandment law, He will
do that for us which we could never do for ourselves.

SYMPTOMS—Chills occur for several hours, followed by drenching sweats every 1-3 days.
CAUSES—There are four types of parasites which are introduced into the bloodstream by the anopheles
mosquito. If the disease becomes chronic (recurrent), it results in general debility, anemia, and an
enlarged spleen.
Severe cases can be very debilitating. An especially deadly form is called blackwater fever. The skin
takes on a yellow tint and the urine becomes progressively darker in color. Few people survive three
attacks of blackwater fever.
This disease generally occurs only in tropical climates, but it can and does occur in the United States as
well."
disease-general-typhoid-fever,Typhoid Fever,"TREATMENT
• Call a physician.
• Put him to bed and give him air and moderate warmth, and lots of water to drink.
• Place him on a diet of fruit juices and vegetable broths. All patients with typhoid fever
must have raw garlic to eat.
• Give at least one hot bath every day. Have him remain in the tub as long as possible (30
minutes or longer). Put cold cloths on the head and throat if weak or faint. Finish with a
cold towel rub or spray.
• Give a daily high enema.
• Red clover tea and goldenseal tea are both good. Add 1 tsp. red clover blossoms to a cup
of boiling water. Steep, and drink 5-12 cups a day.
—Follow directions under ""Fevers.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is strong to deliver. Help has been laid on One that is mighty. He
encircles man with His long human arm, while with His divine arm He lays hold of all the power of
heaven. Trust and obey, for there is no other way, to be happy in Jesus.
YELLOW FEVER—1
SYMPTOMS—Illness begins about 3-6 days after the mosquito bite. Onset is extremely abrupt (within
a few hours), with a rapid rise in temperature from normalcy to 103o F. or more. Face is flushed and
swollen, and eyes bloodshot. There are severe pains in the head, and down the spine and legs. Pulse is
rapid early in the disease.
CAUSES—Caused by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, or one of several closely related species.
Rarely occurs today in North America, but is more common in Central and South America. Mosquito
netting should be used.
• Read the article on ""Fevers"" and apply it to control high fever (above 103o F.). Reduce
fever with gently given tepid sponges over the body.
• Give a high enema (preferably with a saline enema), and put the patient to bed. He
should eat no food for 3 days; instead, squeeze juice of 2-3 lemons into a quart of water
and drink 2 quarts unsweetened every day. Drink a quart of an herb tea (listed under
""Fevers"").
• If vomiting is severe, so water cannot be retained in the stomach, give an enema every 2
hours, of about a half pint of tepid water with half tsp. of baking soda dissolved in it. Give
these enemas slowly.
• Give an emetic if there is a lot of phlegm.
• On fourth day, begin giving him light, nutritious food. Give fomentations to the spine,
with cold foot bath and cold compress to the head, twice a day.
• To avoid liver damage, do not use tobacco, alcohol, drugs, excess salt, cooked foods,
fried foods, processed foods, etc.

Immune Problems

SYMPTOMS—Onset comes 1-4 weeks after the germs enter the body. First a tired feeling and general
weakness, then possibly a headache and nosebleed. The fever rises higher each day, until by the end of
the first week it be 104o F. The evening temperature is distinctly higher than in the morning. Appetite is
poor, the tongue is coated, and the teeth and lips have a brownish coat. There is either diarrhea or
constipation, and stools are offensive. The abdomen is distended.
CAUSES—Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease caused by the typhoid bacillus.
Germs are taken into the body through food or drink that has been directly or indirectly contaminated by
bowel or kidney discharges from a typhoid fever patient.
If the body was kept clean and only pure food and water was consumed, there would by no typhoid."
disease-general-weakened-autoimmune-system,Weakened Autoimmune System,"TREATMENT
• Eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. Obtain adequate protein from vegetables, not from
meat. Eat broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, onions, garlic, and similar worthwhile food.
Skip the junk food.
• High doses of vitamin A in the form of carrot juice (beta carotene) are especially helpful.
That, along with vitamin C, may be the most important vitamins for the immune system.
Essential fatty acids (fresh or newly purchased flaxseed oil is especially good); zinc at 50
mg, three times a day; selenium at 300-900 mcg per day, germanium at 50 mg/day.
• Vitamin B complex, especially B6, B12, folic acid, and pantothenic acid. Vitamin E:
400-800 units.
• Herbs include echinacea root, dandelion, red clover, and kelp.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When the soul surrenders itself to God, a new power takes possession of the
new heart. A change is wrought which man could never accomplish for himself. By faith in His
overcoming strength, obey all the Word of God, and you will be blessed.

SYMPTOMS—It is the immune system which fights infections, and it does this by triggering defenses
against invading bacteria. The antibodies and antitoxins of this system recognize these foreign bodies
and send white blood cells to attack them. With his immune system weakened, a person is less able to
withstand Epstein Barr virus, candidiasis, food allergies, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, etc.
Infections occur more easily. The person is more susceptible to colds, infections, and viruses.
CAUSES—Autoimmune disorders can result from conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to
kidney disease. Unrelenting stress, chronic allergies, chronic infections can exhaust the immune system.
Medicinal drugs, such as cortisone, prednisone and chemotherapy cause immune depression! Beware of
them! Other causes of a weakened immune system are vaccinations and immunizations against common
childhood and epidemic diseases. The thymus gland seems to be the most affected by this weakening.
The thymus gland is especially important due to its production of T-helper cells.
Prolonged stress, or toxic exposure to chemicals or radiation can weaken the immune system. Severe
infections can both result and cause it. An example of this would be allergies (resulting from immune
malfunction) which follow a severe case of rheumatic fever, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or other acute
viral or bacterial disease. Lack of proper rest is yet another cause.
Yet another cause are nutritional deficiencies. Some natural healing specialists believe that any
infectious disease may be considered an immune deficiency problem.
The taking of aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, asthma, low birth weight and birth defects.
Meat contains hormones, antibiotics, and bacteria which brings on disease. Alcohol, nicotine, and a high-
sugar diet weaken the immune system. Air pollution is yet another problem (move out of the city!)
Hypothyroidism can also result in immune deficiency. Marijuana, cocaine, and the morphine family are
other culprits. Mercury amalgam fillings are yet another incipient cause."
disease-general-lupus,Lupus,"SYMPTOMS—It usually begins suddenly with fever, fatigue, arthritis and/or joint pain. Those with it
are frequently misdiagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis. Ninety percent of lupus occurs in women in
their 30s. Other symptoms include a characteristic facial ""butterfly"" rash, severe hair loss, and papular
skin lesions. This rash forms over the nose and cheeks in something of a butterfly shape (which tends to
intensify because of sunlight).
The skin lesions are small, yellowish lumps. They leave scars when they disappear. (""Lupus"" means
""wolf"" in Latin; indicating the rough-skinned appearance it gives to the skin.)
Also generally present are kidney disease (in 50% of those with lupus) and low white blood cell count.
All this, in turn, produces inflammation of the joints and/or blood vessels, affecting many parts of the
body.
Sometimes the first appearance of the problem is an arthritic-like condition, with swelling and pain in
the joints and fingers. Severe cases can affect the brain and heart.
Sometimes the central nervous system is affected, and deep depression, amnesia, seizures, or psychosis
can result.
CAUSES—Lupus is an inflammatory disease of the connective tissue. It has been classified as an
autoimmune disease, since the body is attacking itself.
Ultraviolet rays in the sun can trigger the first attack. Stress, childbirth, fatigue, infection, chemicals, and
certain drugs can also bring it on.
TREATMENT—Dr. Max Gerson used a careful, very nourishing diet, including vegetable and fruit
juices and vitamin-mineral supplementation to eliminate lupus in his patients, but the dietary change had
to be total or no progress was made. All meat, gravy, fats, junk food, fried food, soft drinks, caffeine,
alcohol, etc. had to be eliminated from the diet. The diet had to be low in fat and salt (thus helping the
weakened kidneys).
• It is best to eliminate all unsaturated fats. Fats quickly become rancid and, in that form,
harm the connective tissue, and wear away the myelin sheath which covers the nerves.
• Avoid eating alfalfa sprouts, for they contain canavain which, in your body, replaces its
arginine.
• A vegetable juice fast would be very helpful.
• Do not take birth control pills; they can intensify the lupus.
• Up to 10% of the lupus cases originate by taking medicinal drugs (New England Journal
of Medicine). Pollutants, additives, chemicals, and certain foods can also bring it on.
When the cause is drugs, the kidneys or nervous system are generally not affected, the
lupus is a milder case, and it tends to stop when the drug is no longer taken.
• Parasites are associated with lupus. The parasites excrete droppings which interfere with
body functions. Until the blood stream is cleansed and the parasites removed, healing
cannot commence.
• Allergies can be another causative factor. Search them out and eliminate them. Here are
several to consider: beef, cow's milk, wheat, corn, ammonia, hair spray, formaldehyde,
perfume ethanol, pesticides.
• Those with Raynoud's disease should live carefully, for they are also prone to
contracting lupus. Those with lupus are often misdiagnosed as having syphilis. Lupus is
not AIDS. HIV destroys the body's immune system, but lupus is one's immune system
destroying his body.
• Obtain enough rest and exercise. Avoid all stress.
• Echinacea, yucca, red clover, pau d'arco, and goldenseal are helpful herbs.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God's faithful ones have ever been able to obtain help from Him. Give Him
your heart, and He will fulfill all your needs. In His strength, you can obey all that He commands in the
Bible."
disease-general-sjogren-s-syndrome,Sjogren'S Syndrome,"SYMPTOMS—A variety of symptoms keyed to a lack of mucous-secreting glands to not function
properly: dry or parched mouth, burning throat, trouble chewing or swallowing, gritty or sandy eyes,
eyes which feel like they have a film over them.
Other symptoms include tooth decay, joint pain, digestive problems, dry nose, dry skin, lung problems,
vaginal irritations, muscular weakness, kidney problems, burning tongue, and extreme fatigue.
CAUSES—Sjogren's syndrome (pronounced SHOW-grens) is a chronic autoimmune disease which was
first identified by a Swedish physician, Henrik Sjogren, in 1933.
As an autoimmune disorder, Sjogren's syndrome causes the body's immune system to work against
itself, destroying mucous-secreting glands, including salivary and tear-producing tissues.
Although not life-threatening, Sjogren's is progressive, debilitating, and can permanently damage the
eyes and mouth if symptoms are not treated.
When Sjogren's occurs alone it is considered ""primary."" When patients also have an additional
connective disease, Sjogren's is called ""secondary."" These other diseases include rheumatoid arthritis,
lupus, polymyositis (inflammation of the muscles), scleroderma (thickening and stiffening of the skin) or
poyarteritis nodosa (inflammation of the arteries).
Anyone at any age can be afflicted with this disease. In the U.S., estimates run to 200,000 to 4 million;
of which 90% are women.
Because each symptom affects different parts of the body, physicians and dentists often treat the
symptom which applies to their field as minor and of little consequence.
Tests are available to diagnose the disease. The cause is, so far, unknown. And, to date, there are no
known cures. The treatments, some of which are noted below, only help a person live with the condition,
rather than solving it. Yet, if it can save your eyesight or an internal organ, it is worth it.
TREATMENT—You can learn much more about this condition by contacting the National Sjogren's
Syndrome Association, P.O. Box 42207, Phoenix, AZ 85023 (800-395-NSSA); they will send you free
literature.
• Or contact the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation, 333 North Broadway, Suite 2000,
Jericho, NY 11753 (516-933-6365).
• They will tell you that artificial tears (eye drops) and salivas, ointments and ant-
inflammatory drugs are among the treatments prescribed.
• We asked one individual we know, who has Sjogren's and believes in, and regularly
uses, natural remedies, and were told this:
• Women with this problem produce too much estrogen, in relation to the amount of
progesterone they make. So purchase progesterone cream and rub in on the belly.
• For the eyes, add 1/4th tsp. of table salt (or its equivalent in seawater) to one cup of
water, bring it to a boil, then let it set until it is tepid. Put some of this in the eyes every so
often. Do not use store-bought salt, because it contains aluminum, which may damage the
eyes. Take emulsified vitamin A, and use torula yeast. Black walnut husk tea may help.
—Also see ""Dry Tear Ducts.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is our present, all-sufficient Saviour. In Him all fullness dwells. It is our
privilege to know that Christ will be with us, guiding us even to the end. Trust and obey Him. He will
give you grace to do it.

Aging"
disease-general-aging,Aging,"SYMPTOMS—You are getting old, and you know it.
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT—Some people age more rapidly than others. Causes can include heredity,
or a debilitating disease. But there can be other reasons.
• Exercise is important. Lack of it causes loss of bone and muscle mass, and inevitable
physical degeneration. Walk out of doors every day! Your life depends on it. Breathe
deeply. Be positive and cheerful as you walk. Hold your head up and enjoy it.
• Hearing loss can accompany aging. Too much fat in the diet, and lack of vitamin A can
cause hearing problems. Some physicians suggest that hearing loss is a sign of later heart
disease.
• Processes of aging are accelerated by poor living, wrong eating and drinking habits, and
dangerous activities. Some people make themselves prematurely old.
• Older people do not absorb nutrients as well as younger people. This includes vitamins,
minerals, and amino acids. Enzymes and co-enzymes are not produced as abundantly as
they formerly were. Food supplements are needed even more than in earlier years.
• Eat good, nourishing food, but do not overeat. You are not working hard physically, as
you once did. Experimental rats were given much less in food calories, and lived 50%
longer.
• Systematic undereating is one of the key secrets of longevity. Lose weight and keep
slim. Extra weight rapidly ages you.
• Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. A high fiber diet is important. If you are not
hungry, then do not eat very much.
• Brittleness and fragility of bones result as calcium is more poorly absorbed. Make sure
you are obtaining an adequate supply of calcium, vitamin D, and copper.
• Drink freshly-made carrot juice every day.
• If possible, drink only spring or steam-distilled water. Keep your body's water table
high. It will go a long way toward protecting you against later heart and blood vessel
problems.
• There is increased oxidation of cells with the advance of years. Take vitamin E to help
safeguard against this. Vitamins A and C are also antioxidants.
• The B complex are needed for good brain function, proper digestion, sound nerves, and
physical stamina.
• Vitamin C in your diet will lessen the likelihood of strokes and blood vessel ruptures. It
strengthens the body, and promotes healing of wounds. It fights infection.
• Make sure you are obtaining enough minerals. Take a vitamin/mineral supplement so
you will get enough potassium, iron, selenium, zinc, and all the rest.
• Eat a little Nova Scotia dulse or Norway kelp each day to get those needed trace
minerals.
• Stop smoking, drinking, and living in excess. Throw out the caffeine and processed
foods. Go to bed on time. If you cannot sleep in the middle of the night, pray and thank
God for your blessings. Go outside and breathe deeply of the good night air, then go back
to bed and to sleep.
• As much as you can, stay away from medicinal drugs, and you will be happier for it.
• A person who is depressed or negative will age faster. Cheer up, go to God and surrender
your life to Him. Obey His Ten Commandment laws and trust your life to Him. Be
peaceful in Christ. Find in Him your strength and hope.
• It can be more difficult to deal with stress as you get older. God can help you with that
also.
• Find someone to help, write to, and pray for.
• Helpful herbs include ginseng, gotu kola, echinacea, cayenne, pau d'arco, hawthorn, and
suma.
ENCOURAGEMENT—What a privilege is ours, to be connected with the Majesty of heaven; the One
who loved us and gave His life for us. Never forsake Him, and you will be deeply blessed.

Wounds, Bruising
IMPORTANT—Look under the section, Childbirth and Children: Infant Problems and Childhood
Problems, for many more skin diseases."
disease-general-skin-problems,Skin Problems,"GENERAL SKIN CARE—The condition of your skin is a window to your lifestyle. Eat, work, rest,
exercise properly, and take care of your liver. Avoid oils, fats, and fried foods. Take a cold shower every
morning and a warm shower at night. Use less soap and never use strong soaps.
HYDRO—Here are several hydrotherapy applications. These hydrotherapy treatments will be found in
more detail in the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), available from this publisher. Page
numbers refer to that book.
SKIN DISEASES—Short, Cold Full Bath (pp. 124-125). But restrictions are listed as to who this can be
used on.
BURNS—The Evaporating Compress; the Cold Irrigating Compress (cool, wet cloth over the area, to
reduce heat or sprinkle water over it, to intensify the cooling effect); if very extensive, the Prolonged or
Continuous Neutral Bath.
DRY SKIN—Sweating Wet Sheet Pack, oil rubbed on skin, Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub;
Wet Sheet Rub, Steam Bath, Hot-air Bath, Electric Light Bath, Sun Bath (p. 240).
ERUPTIONS—If dry, not irritable, give prolonged Neutral Bath. If scaly, alkaline bath (soda bath or
oatmeal bath). If moist and irritable, cool evaporating compress moistened with soda solution (1 oz. to 1
gal.). If skin is thickened, as in chronic eczema, Hot or Alternate (hot and cold) Spray Douche or
Compress for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day. If extensively damaged skin (as in pemphigus, confluent
smallpox, bad burns), the Continuous Neutral Full Bath until the skin is healed (p. 242).
ERYTHEMA—Cool Evaporating Compress or Irrigating Compress (p. 242).
SWEATING FEET—Revulsive Douche to feet, with extremes in temperature as great as possible;
Alternate Hot and Cold Foot Bath, Heating Compress to feet during night, with Cold Mitten Friction of
feet in the morning on arising (p. 243).
INACTIVE SKIN—Sweating process, followed by a cold bath (p. 180).
INCREASE SKIN CIRCULATION AND TONE—Short sweating procedures, followed by short cold
applications— such as Wet Sheet Rub, Shallow Bath, or Cold Douche. Daily Cold morning Bath, Cold
Towel Rub, Cold Shower, or Shallow Rubbing Bath. (p. 226).
PRURITUS—Prolonged Neutral Bath; copious water drinking; large enema; daily aseptic dietary (p.
242).
SKIN GRAFTS—Paraffin Bath (pp. 79-82).
SKIN SCALING—Neutral Alkaline Bath daily for 15 minutes to 1 hour (p. 241)."
disease-general-bruising,Bruising,"TREATMENT
•As soon as possible after an injury, place an ice pack on the bruised area and keep it there
for 30 minutes. If done right away, this will keep it from swelling. Often the swelling does
more damage than the bruise. Later apply a poultice of greens (fresh or dry), oatmeal,
wheat bran, comfrey, or charcoal. Pulverize the charcoal, tie it in a cloth, wet it in warm
water, and lay it over the bruise for several hours. Repeat until it is better.
PREVENTION—
• Strengthen the blood and vessels by eating a nourishing diet, rich in green leafy
vegetables and fresh fruit. Buckwheat is also helpful; also vegetable juices containing
carrot, celery, and beet.
• Take vitamin C, to bowel tolerance (be sure bioflavonoids are included), and vitamin E:
800-1,200 units daily. Go out in the sun and absorb some vitamin D. People with vitamin
C deficiencies bruise more easily than do others, for their blood vessels are weaker. Also
important is vitamin P (bioflavonoids).
—Also see ""Easy Bruising.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus is ministering on your behalf in the heavenly Sanctuary. He provides
you with enabling grace to obey His Ten Commandment law. Thank God for salvation in Christ! He is
all we need now, and for eternity.

(Contusions)
SYMPTOMS—Although the skin is not broken, the underlying tissue is injured. The result is some pain
and swelling, and perhaps black and blue marks.
CAUSE—Contusions occur when the skin is injured, but the skin is not broken. Blood vessels have
been ruptured, and thus have released blood into the surrounding tissue, including the skin."
disease-general-easy-bruising,Easy Bruising,"TREATMENT
• Improve your diet. Take alfalfa tablets and a good vitamin-mineral supplement 2-3 times
a day.
• Frequent bruising indicates that the body's clotting factors are not strong. Take more
vitamin K. Vitamin D is another natural clotting factor. Take care of yourself—and don't
bang yourself against things!
• Some people are more prone than others to produce bruise spots. That can be a sign of
kidney and liver disorders.
• Anemia can also cause bruising, as well as allergies.
• Other factors that make one more susceptible to bruising are overweight and the time of
menstruation.
• Purplish bumps under the skin which do not heal and look like bruises could be a sign of
AIDS. Leukemia can also cause frequent or large bruises.
• Aspirin causes internal bleeding, and can increase surface bruise marks. Also beware of
anti-clotting drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, asthma medicines. Alcohol
and hard drugs will weaken the clotting factors also.
• Helpful herbs include burdock, aloe vera, cayenne, kelp, and white oak bark.
• Garlic, alfalfa, and rose hips are useful.
—Also see ""Bruising.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. This faith can
penetrate the darkest cloud and bring rays of light and hope to the desponding soul. It is the absence of
this faith and trust which brings perplexity and distressing fears.
CUTS, SCRAPES, and WOUNDS
SYMPTOMS—Cut, scraped, and torn skin from collisions, falls, or cutting with glass, metal, etc.
• If the wound is small, let the blood flow for a short time as you clean it. This helps
cleanse the wound better. If the wound is larger, then you need to stop the bleeding first,
and then cleanse the wound. Superficial cuts can be cleaned with soap and water or 3%
hydrogen peroxide.
• Golden seal root powder helps stop bleeding and promote healing.
• Wounds may be bathed with several herbal washes or poultices, including aloe vera,
comfrey, or plantain.
• Squeeze together the edges of the wound and place a butterfly bandage, or something
similar, over it. Apply one for every inch of the cut. A small cut can be closed up and
sealed with a Band-Aid or gauze wrapped enough to seal it, but not tight enough to hinder
circulation.
• To stop bleeding, apply direct pressure. If an artery has been cut, the blood will spurt
with each heart beat. Small artery cuts should receive direct pressure by your finger,
pressed down over clean cloth on the wound. Larger ones may require a tourniquet to
control it until you get help. But do not use a tourniquet unless you have to, for they can
be dangerous if left too tight and too long. Placing the wound in ice-cold water will also
tend to stop the bleeding.
• If blood soaks through your bandage, add a new one over the old one. If applying
pressure does not solve the problem, elevate the limb above the level of the heart, all the
while applying pressure with your finger.
• If inflammation or redness occurs later where the cut was, make a strong tea of a
nonpoisonous, green herb (Goldenseal powder is the best), and soak the injured area in
this hot tea for about an hour every day until it is all right. Re-bandage after each soaking.
• If a finger, etc., is cut all the way off—and there is no help available—quickly place it
right back in its own blood, and hold it in place with a wrapping till you can get help.
Healing will often occur. Go to the nearest hospital emergency room.
• Give vitamin C orally, to bowel tolerance (1-5 grams).
• Apply tee tree oil to prevent infection, and reapply every 2-3 hours. To accelerate
healing, apply locally one or more of the following: vitamin E (it will also reduce
scarring), fresh aloe vera juice, or a comfrey poultice.
—Also see ""Bleeding.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Trusting in God, we can have victory in our lives over the sins which so easily
beset. Through faith, we today can reach the heights of God's purpose for us. Ever trust Him.

(Ecchymosis)
SYMPTOMS—Frequent and easily made bruising, when others around you do not seem to have this
problem.
CAUSE—Low fiber diets, containing little fruit and vegetables. In other words, junk foods such as
coffee, tea, white flour products, and soft drinks."

• Keep the skin surface clean, dry, and free of friction. Use only natural, chemical-free
soaps, deodorants, and other products you place on your skin. These are available from a
health food store.
• To add dryness, starch can be applied. But never use talcum (baby) powder. It is ground
talc, a soft rock which can cause cancer. Do not use it on your body or a baby's.
• Improve the diet and the general health. Eat garlic, soured products, and acidophilus.
Avoid sugar and refined foods, for they nourish bacteria.
• Avoid sitting in one position too long. Wear loose fitting, all cotton, clothing. Make sure
it is not rubbing on the skin.
• Helpful herbs include chamomile tea, which soothes the skin, fights bacteria, and help
healing occur. Aloe vera gel is also good. Tea tree oil will help the skin heal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—He who could not see human beings exposed to destruction, without pouring
out His soul unto death to save them from eternal ruin, will look with pity and compassion upon every
soul who realizes that he cannot save himself.

SYMPTOMS—This is an eruption of the skin, caused by two skin surfaces rubbing together (groin,
breasts, underarms, or inner thighs)
CAUSE—Bacteria and yeast can grow in those areas and start an ulceration. Intertrigo primarily affects
overweight women who perspire heavily or anyone who has urinary incontinence. In people with
diabetes, it is more likely to develop into secondary infections. It most often occurs in warm climates
and during the summer."
disease-general-swelling,Swelling,"TREATMENT
• Take bromelin (which is fresh pineapple enzyme), either in tablet form or in fresh
pineapple juice.
• Make a tea out of chamomile, comfrey, white oak bark, mugwort, dill, or oregano. Drink
it and apply it externally to the swelling.
• A contrast (hot and cold) bath or shower may help relieve it. Cold water alone may do it.
A raw potato poultice over the area is helpful.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Man is erring and frail, but God is kind and patient, and of tender compassion.
He has heaven and earth at His command, and He knows just what we need even before we present our
necessities and desires before Him.

SYMPTOMS—Swellings occur in various parts of the body.
CAUSE—This can be caused by bruising, sprains, infections, arthritis, or edema."
disease-general-scarring,Scarring,"TREATMENT
• To accelerate healing, apply locally one or more of the following: vitamin E, fresh aloe
vera juice, or a comfrey poultice. Of these, vitamin E is especially good in avoiding later
scarring. Apply vitamin E locally (topically) and include it in the diet. Prick an E capsule
and let the oil ooze over the cut or scar. In some instances, if this is done even old scars
will reduce in size and possibly disappear.
• Clean and care for all wounds, so that they heal properly. Close gaps with a butterfly
bandage. This will lessen scarring. Do not pick at scabs; let healing progress naturally. Eat
healthfully. Be gentle on healing wounds, when rubbing the skin, bathing, etc.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ is your Advocate, your Helper, and your Friend. He alone is your
Saviour from sin. He can enable you, by His grace, to keep His Ten Commandment law, and do all that
is pleasing in His sight.

Part 2
Sores, Ulcers, Burns

SYMPTOMS—A cut or wound has occurred, and you want to avoid later scarring."
disease-general-blisters,Blisters,"TREATMENT
• Decide whether or not you want to prick it and let out the fluid. It is generally best to
prick large ones, and ignore small ones. But if it is likely to break, you do better to drain it
ahead of time. Sterilize the area before doing this. Leave the roof on afterward; this
protects the skin while healing occurs.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Take the hand of Christ and hold it firmly. He will hold you with a grip that
will not let go—unless you choose to wander away after the devil's trinkets.
SORES, ABSCESSES, PUS
SYMPTOMS—Included here are sores that will not heal, and abscesses, which are large and also have
pus. But they do not seem to heal, so become open skin ulcers. The swollen part becomes inflamed and
tender. There may be alternate fever and chills. Also see ""Boils.""
An abscess can form on the surface of the skin or within the body—in the sinuses, teeth, gums, tonsils,
lungs, brain, abdominal wall, intestinal tract, breasts, kidneys, etc.
CAUSES—Causes include poor living and bad diet; enervation; lack of rest; worry; exhaustion; as well
as toxic poisoning. It may also be caused by an infected wound, an illness, lowered resistance, certain
drugs, food allergies, stress, or junk foods. Drugs containing sulphur can produce boils.
Leg ulcers are a special problem; they are open sores which develop on the legs. They are more likely to
occur in those with varicose veins. Poor circulation causes the skin tissue to break down. Because we
have here a circulatory problem, the following treatment may, or may not, benefit the patient.
• For sores that will not heal: vitamin E: 200 units a day. Apply a dressing of fresh
comfrey leaves and root or a paste made from raw garlic on gauze for 8-10 hours.
• For a boil (furuncle), or carbuncle, follow the directions below for an abscess.
• For a surface abscess: Keep the infected area clean with soap and water. Bring it to a
""head"" by placing hot compresses on it. This will make it soft in the center. (Hot
compresses or ice bags will also help relieve the pain; hot compresses also promote
healing.) A poultice with 3% boric acid can be used or a hot Epsom salt compress
(dissolve Epsom salt in hot water and apply as a compress all night). Echinacea can be
used, or a clay poultice. Some use a flaxseed poultice to soften and mature the head.
Either it will open itself or, when ""ripe,"" you can open it with a sterile needle. Then flush
it clean with a syringe with pure water or one of the above solutions. If bits of puss or
dead flesh still remain, apply 3% hydrogen peroxide; then flush out with pure water. The
cavity will gradually fill in and heal.
• Take vitamin C orally to bowel tolerance, along with A, B complex, and E. Get plenty of
bed rest, and drink lots of fluids to help flush the system. Clean the bowels with an enema
once a week. Stay on a vegetarian diet, avoiding heavy starches, chocolate, excess sweets,
too many saturated or hydrogenated fats. Brief juice fasts of one to three days are very
helpful, especially if you are overweight. Take alternate hot and cold showers every
morning and evening (or cool baths every evening). Also good: chlorophyll, garlic, and
kelp.
• Drink distilled water with fresh lemon juice, plus 3 cups of goldenseal or echinacea tea,
each day.
• Go on a liquid fast for 24 to 72 hours and stay in bed as much as possible during that
time. This will cleanse the system and prepare it for a nourishing diet.
• A nutritious diet with adequate vitamins and minerals is needed to correct the problems
in the body which led to the abscessed condition.
• A slippery elm bark and lobelia poultice soothes and helps promote healing.
• Apply honey externally to the area. It is believed that honey destroys bacteria by
drawing the moisture out of those sores.
• On such open skin ulcers, you can also place herbal poultices, such as German
chamomile, marigold, arnica, euphorbia, cliff rose, snake root, and/or witch hazel. Also
helpful is red clover tea and carrot and beet juice. Also useful: Burdock root, cayenne, and
yellow dock root.
• Applying chlorophyll water to the area several times a day will keep it cleansed.
—Also see ""Boils.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ revealed the love of God to mankind. As Jesus was in human nature, so
God means His followers to be. In His strength we are to live the life of purity and nobility which the
Saviour lived.

SYMPTOMS—Rounded, fluid-filled spots on the skin.
CAUSES—They are most frequently caused by wearing different shoes or the excessive handling of
tools."
disease-general-canker-sores,Canker Sores,"TREATMENT
• Goldenseal powder or a moistened goldenseal tea bag applied over the ulcer is one of
best treatments. It may also bring relief of the pain.
• Wash your mouth with plain hot water, to draw healing blood and help relieve pain. This
is a simple hydrotherapy treatment.
• Squeeze vitamin E oil on the sore several times a day.
• As soon as the first tingle is felt, take 500 mg of Vitamin C with bioflavonoids, 3 times a
day, for 3 days.
PREVENTION—
• Careful thought will teach you things you do which tend to cause them. This might
include mouthwashes, citrus fruit, coffee, or certain other foods—especially sharp, highly
seasoned, or tart foods. Do not smoke or chew snuff!
• Onions help reduce their number; include them in your food preparation. Lysine, vitamin
B12, and folic acid help also.
• Do not eat meat for two weeks. Meat increases body acidity. Stop eating it entirely, and
you are less likely to have canker sores.
• Avoid sugar and processed foods. Citrus fruit cause them in some people.
• Avoid physical damage to the area immediately in, and around, the mouth. Avoid sharp
foods, such as peanut brittle. Use a soft toothbrush with no toothpaste.
• Try not to bite the tongue or cheek. Do not talk or turn your head while chewing.
• A hair analysis will help you determine your mineral and pH balance. Maintaining a
proper balance can help you avoid canker sores.
• In the Midwest, they put a little earwax on the sore to help heal it.
• If you have repeated attacks of canker sores, something is wrong. With careful checking,
you should be able to find it. For example, with some people, it is simply a matter of not
overeating on sweet foods, even naturally sweet fruit.
• Beware! If you have a mouth sore which does not heal, see a dentist. There are certain
other diseases which first appear somewhat like canker or cold sores—yet which are much
more dangerous.
—See also ""Cold Sore."" You may also wish to turn to ""Syphilis,"" which often initially appears around
the mouth. However, the appearance of the hard chancre of syphilis is much different than that of canker
or cold sores.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God is pleased when we keep our faces turned toward the Sun of
Righteousness. When we are in trouble and pressed down with anxieties, the Lord is near, and He bids
us cast all our care upon Him, because He cares for us.

(Aphthous Ulcers)
SYMPTOMS—Small oval or round white ulcers that can be very painful. They appear on the tongue,
gums, inner or outer lips, or on the insides of the cheeks.
At first it appears as a red, warm spot, which then ulcerates and has a yellowish border. Next, a
yellowish mixture of fluid, bacteria, and white blood cells is seen. There is often burning or tingling at
the place.
Canker sores are different in appearance than cold sores, in that canker sores do not form blisters.
CAUSES—The Greek word, aphthae, means ""to set on fire."" Allergies, stress, vitamin deficiencies,
endocrine imbalance, and viral infections are considered to be possible causes.
You are more likely to have them if your parents had them. They generally do not begin appearing till
the age of 20, and occur equally among men and women. Older people have them less frequently.
Canker sores generally heal by themselves within a week or two. It is said that as much of 40% of the
adult population experiences them. Some people seem to have one after the other. People with Crohn's
Disease (an illness of the bowels) are more likely to have them. Vaccines and antibiotics may cause
them."
disease-general-bed-sores,Bed Sores,"TREATMENT
• Apply sugar or honey poultice to the sore; it will help draw out the poisons. Local
applications can also include zinc oxide ointment, aloe vera, wheat germ oil, or comfrey.
Avoid meat products. Make a paste out of crushed comfrey leaves and slippery elm, and
cover the sores. Wash the sores 3-4 times a day with a combination tea (witch hazel and
myrrh or goldenseal). Mix powdered comfrey leaves and slippery elm in equal parts, mix
with water, make a paste, spread on a cloth, and tie it over the sore. It can be left on
overnight. When dry, sprinkle some powdered goldenseal or echinacea over the sores to
disinfect the area; cover with cotton or wool (not a synthetic fabric).
• Improve the diet; this is crucial to solving the problem. Drink enough liquids, even when
not thirsty. Avoid processed, fried, and junk food. Do not eat meat.
• The diet should include enough fiber. Oat bran is especially good. The bowels should
move every day. Lower the pH with acid foods (such as cranberries).
PREVENTION—Prevention is much easier than treatment.
• Use protective padding on the bed, massage the skin to stimulate the circulation, and
keep the skin dry and clean. Turn the patient regularly. Watch for signs of redness.
Occasional sunlight to the skin is beneficial. Sponge bathe daily with a mild herbal soap
(never with harsh soaps). The bed must be kept clean and the sheet without wrinkles.
Sheepskin bed covers help disperse weight more evenly. The use of air or water
mattresses can be helpful. Sponge baths are helpful. Loose-fitting clothing allows air to
penetrate to the skin (cotton is best). If the patient can sit up, have him do it 3-4 times a
day. Sometimes prop him up with a pillow.
• Give a well-balanced, adequate diet. Give plenty of greens and carrot juice. Give
vitamins A, B, C, E, and zinc.
• Apply vitamin E oil to the skin area.
• The alternate hot and cold compress is very helpful. This is a fomentation application
with the application of a cold compress after it.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Whatever may be the burdens that you bear, cast them upon the Lord. He can
solve your problems, He can provide your deepest needs.

(Pressure Sores)
SYMPTOMS—These are deep skin ulcers—especially found on buttocks, hips, sacrum, shoulder
blades, elbows, and heels.
CAUSES—These ulcers form during periods of prolonged bed rest, as pressure is continually applied to
bony parts of the body. The bedridden elderly, the unconscious, and the paraplegic are those most likely
to experience this problem.
Such individuals generally have a high pH (too alkaline), and are deficient in vitamins A, B2
(riboflavin), E, and C, as well as zinc."
disease-general-moles,Moles,"TREATMENT
• To remove a suspected skin cancer (before it has continued long enough to go into the
system), fasten a thin slice of garlic to it in the evening and leave on overnight. Do this for
2-4 nights. The spot will slough off; and, as it heals new, fresh flesh will take its place.
—For more on this see ""Skin Cancer.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus has said that He has set before us an open door, and no man can shut it.
The open door is before us; and, through the grace of Christ, beams of merciful light stream forth from
the gates ajar. Be faithful, trust and obey, and your future is bright.

(and unknown spots)
CAUSE—Most moles are harmless. But those that are flat, or nearly flat, are larger than the top of a
pencil eraser or have a mottled color should be checked. If an existing mole turns blue, white, or red and
begins to bleed or develops a crust—have it checked. It may be skin cancer."
disease-general-blackheads,Blackheads,"TREATMENT
• Squeeze out the visible blackhead very gently, with a blackhead remover (available in a
drugstore). Never use fingers to do it. Then wash with mild soap and water.
• Sunlight kills the surface bacteria, and thus clears the condition temporarily. But sunlight
can also stimulate the oil glands, possibly making the condition worse later.
• Do not overeat. Avoid fat, greasy, or fried foods, ice cream, cream, butter, margarine,
chocolate, pastry, sweets, or much starchy food.
• Eat a nourishing diet of vegetables, but avoid corn. Eat protein foods in moderation.
Supplement the diet with vitamins and minerals. Vitamin A is important.
• Avoid alcohol, tobacco, coffee, or cocoa.
• Obtain adequate rest at night and keep the bowels open.
• Exercise out-of-doors, but avoid exercise which causes perspiration.
• Put no creams, oils, or ointments on the face. Keep hands away from the face.
• Wash the hair twice a week.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We can have access to God and be accepted by Him, through Christ our Lord.
Jesus can strengthen us to obey commands given in the Bible. In Christ, we can overcome our sins.

SYMPTOMS—Blackheads are small, tallow-like plugs formed in the pores by the accumulation of dirt,
oil, and bacteria. They are black, at the exposed end, because of oxidation rather than the presence of
germs. They generally cause no itching or pain, but are unsightly.
CAUSES—The duct of an oil gland becomes plugged with partly dried oil mixed with, more or less,
dust or dirt. Most cases occur between 12 and 30 years of age.
Problems with digestion, constipation, or underactive thyroid and anemia seem to be contributing
factors.
Although germs do not cause them, blackheads can easily become infected."
disease-general-age-spots,Age Spots,"TREATMENT
• Eat high quality food, purify the blood, nourish the glands, and keep the bowels open.
Exercise
the body and the mind. Keep the immune system in good shape. Take nutritional
supplements.
• A powerful helper is the use of vitamin E (800-1,200 units per day), which tends to
destroy free radicals. Also take vitamin A as beta carotene. Obtain all your fats as
unsaturated fatty acids.
• Eat quality protein foods and stay away from old seeds and nuts. The oils in them may
be rancid. Do not use meat or milk. Do not eat meat.
• Drink enough water, and make sure it is either pure or distilled. Practice deep breathing.
Learn how to relax.
• Avoid all alcohol, coffee, salt, tobacco, white flour, and white sugar. Avoid all
chemicals, drugs, etc., in foods. Do not overeat. Center your diet around broccoli,
cabbage, fruits, whole gains, nuts, oats, seeds, and soybeans. A high fiber diet is
important.
• Go on a brief fast, to cleanse the liver.
• Avoid too much exposure to the sun.
• Do not use commercial skin creams. Use olive oil and a warm wet washcloth, then rinse
with lemon juice and water.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The gifts of Him, who has all power in heaven and earth, are in store for the
children of God. These gifts are precious, for they come to us through the costly sacrifice of the
Redeemer's blood. In Christ we can be overcomers.

Chapping, Cracking, Itching

(Liver Spots)
SYMPTOMS—Age spots (also called liver spots) are the flat brown spots which appear on the skin.
They are especially noticeable on the back of the hands.
CAUSES—Liver spots are different than freckles. Freckles are caused by melanin pigments which react
to the sunlight in fair-skinned people. Liver spots are the result of a ""ceroid"" pigment build up in the skin
of older people.
These latter spots are the outward signs of free radical destruction within the body. There is pre-
oxidation of fats—in the cells instead of in the liver. Free radical damage produces waste materials in
cells throughout the body, including the brain and liver. The causes are poor diet, eating rancid fats, lack
of exercise, excess exposure to the sun, autointoxication, and sluggish liver function."
disease-general-chapped-hands,Chapped Hands,"SYMPTOMS—Red, dry, cracked hands.
CAUSES—The low humidity in the fall and winter dries and irritates the skin. The skin of older people
has less natural oils. This prepares you for problems. But the other causes, listed below, you can do
something about.
PREVENTION—If you find you have this problem, there are several things you can do, to prevent or
lessen it.
• Water removes oils on the skin. But a special kind of water is especially devastating:
soapy water. Dish water not only removes oil from the plates, but also from your hands.
That is part of the reason why your hands are chapped and your arms are not! When you
must wash your hands, try washing only the palms and not the backs—which, having
thinner skin, tends to dry out more easily.
• Soak your hands in warm (not soapy) water for a few moments. As you do this, some of
the water is absorbed by the dry skin. Then pat dry and gently rub a little vegetable oil on
your hands.
• What you place on your skin is absorbed into your body, so beware of all the creams and
lotions on the market. The makers of these products are not required, by the FDA, to
include food grade ingredients; yet those lotions are absorbed into your system for the
body to have to deal with.
• Massage a few drops of glycerine, combined with a few drops of lemon oil (both are
available at pharmacies), into your hands at bedtime.
• Put oil on your hands at night, and then slip cotton gloves over them.
• Hot-air blowers tend to chap the hands; use a towel instead.
• Wear white cotton gloves while doing dry work. For harder work, use leather gloves.
Regarding gloves, avoid vinyl ones, if you can; they makes the hands worse! The rubber
traps the moisture and keeps the skin from breathing.
• Use a long-handled brush, when washing dishes.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Through Jesus, we can have access to God and be accepted by Him. Take
God's promises as your own; plead them before Him as His own Words, and you will receive fullness of
joy."
disease-general-chapped-lips,Chapped Lips,"TREATMENT
• Avoid licking your lips; it dries them out. Occasionally place a little vegetable oil on
your lips.
• Drink enough water.
• Rub your finger alongside of your nose and then on your lips; that puts natural oils back
in them.
• Finish your meal with a small amount of lecithin (which your brain, nerves, and blood
vessels need anyway). When you do this, be sure and leave a small amount of it on your
lips.
• Vitamin B2 and brewer's yeast both help cracked lips.
• Toothpaste dries the lips; instead use a toothbrush and baking soda.
ENCOURAGEMENT—May we come into the audience chamber, reach up the hand of faith, and cast
our helpless souls upon the One mighty to save. He can help us fulfill His beautiful plan for our lives.
DRY SKIN, CHAFING
SYMPTOMS—The skin is overly dry, and there can be a tendency to chafing.
CAUSES—There is both a water loss and an oil loss in the skin. This may seem to be a matter of little
concern. But it can be a sign of a more serious problem: essential fatty acid deficiency that can result in
cardiovascular disease (stroke, heart attack, etc.)
If you are supplementing with vitamin A, in amounts over 100,000 units daily, dry skin may be the first
warning of overdose.
• The solution is not superficial creams, but obtaining enough unsaturated fatty acids in
the diet. These would be the uncooked vegetable oils, such as wheat germ oil, flaxseed oil,
sesame seed oil, corn oil, and soy oil. The oil should be fairly fresh; never use rancid oil,
for it destroys the vitamin E in that meal. Take additional vitamin E supplementation (800-
1,200 units a day).
• If you are not taking supplemental vitamin A, begin taking a moderate amount (not over
50,000 units a day). Carrot juice will also help.
• For the chafing, wear cotton clothes; not synthetics. Australian wool (the wool which
does not scratch) is also good. Wash new inner clothing before you wear it. This softens
the fabric. Do not wear coarse cloth next to the skin.
• Cut out all greases and other saturated fatty acids; and, in their place put a tablespoon of
a good oil (wheat germ oil, flaxseed oil, almond oil, sesame oil, and corn oil) on your food
after it is cooked.
• Drink an adequate amount of water. If necessary, gently rub a small amount of oil over
your body after the bath. Avoid commercial lotions and saturated fats (greases). These are
all absorbed by your body.
• For your shower, rinse off every day with lukewarm water, and use as little soap as
possible. Do not use hot water.
• Pour 2 cups of oatmeal, ground to a fine powder, into a bathtub of warm water. Tie some
oatmeal in a washcloth and, then, use it as a washcloth. Oatmeal is extremely soothing to
the body.
• Use soap which has cocoa butter, coconut oil, or another vegetable oil. They do not clean
as well, but are more soothing to the skin.
• Keep the house warmer, and it will not be as dry. Use a humidifier to put moisture back
into the house.
• For itchy skin, add vinegar to the bath water, and take 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
daily. Helpful herbs include yarrow, violet, and marjoram. Dry brush massage your skin,
to tone it up.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We shall never know, until we reach heaven, what Christ went through to
enable us to overcome sin here on earth and live with Him forever. Thank God for His inexpressible
Gift.

SYMPTOMS—Chapped and cracked lips.
CAUSES—Low humidity, sunlight, wind, and lack of oil on the lips. Here are several other factors you
can control:"
disease-general-scabies,Scabies,"TREATMENT
• Mix flowers of sulphur with petrolatum (petroleum jelly). Sulphur is a poison, so do not
swallow it! In addition, it will stain clothing and does not smell good. But it will work to
kill the scabies mites. For children, use a 5% sulphur (5% sulphur and 95% petrolatum)
mixture; for adults, a 10% mixture. Take a warm, soaking bath before applying the
mixture. Apply it for 3-5 nights before retiring. Cover from neck to toes. Have someone
else apply it to you, so everything is covered.
• During this period, launder your clothes frequently, using hot water. The mite cannot
survive temperatures above 120o F. for more than 5 minutes.
• To reduce the itching sensation soak in a cool bath, starch bath or oatmeal bath (see
directions under Dry, Itching Skin); mix calcium gluconate with a little oil and apply to
the area.
• Eat foods high in zinc, such as soybeans, sunflower seeds, whole-grain products, yeast,
wheat bran, and blackstrap.
• Avoid processed, fried, and junk foods. Use no sugar, chocolate, soft drinks, alcohol, or
tobacco.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God's love is revealed in all His dealings with His earthly children. He loved
us, or He would not have paid such an expensive price to redeem us from sin. Thank Him every day.

Part 5
Growths
—Also see section on Tumors and Cancer.

(The Itch)
SYMPTOMS—An itching in a body part, which tends to continue, then let up, then continue again.
Almost never occurring above the neck, it is most commonly found in hands, finger webs, wrists,
elbows, underarms, waist, and feet. In men, it may also occur in the scrotum and penis; in women, the
nipples are most often affected.
CAUSE—Scabies is an infectious skin disease caused by an almost microscopic mite, called Sarcoptes
scabiei. Although he is a little fellow, you know he is there.
Scabies is found on all social levels. Contact, even by a handshake, is all that is needed to acquire it. It
can also be transmitted through clothing and bed linen. It is more common in older adolescents and
young people, and in girls rather than boys. People can also get it from touching dogs, other animals, or
their bedding. It is a special problem in institutions, such as nursing homes, etc.
Scabies can only be accurately diagnosed by taking skin scrapings and viewing them under a
microscope. If one person in a family has them, it is generally well to treat everyone. Children under 15
are often the first to contract them."
disease-general-wens,Wens,"TREATMENT
• A ""stab"" incision is made at the lowest edge of the cyst. The contents are then sucked
out, and the insides are flushed with hydrogen peroxide. If the cyst is large, the wall will
have to be removed so it does not refill. Then place a daily changed sterile gauze over, and
within, it to keep it draining for a week to 10 days.
• To keep them from growing or returning, avoid fats, especially saturated fats, and all
fried foods, cheese, chocolate, butter, margarine, and dairy products. Do not use alcohol,
nicotine, or caffeine products.
—Also see ""Skin Cancer.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—God is a Friend in perplexity and affliction, a protector in distress, and a
preserver in a thousand dangers that are unseen to us. Trust Him ever; and, by His grace, obey His
Written Word.

Other Minor Skin Problems

(Sebaceous cysts; Steatomas)
SYMPTOMS—These are slow-growing benign cystic cutaneous tumor-like formations. They contain
sebaceous material and are often found on the scalp (wen), ears, back, or scrotum. Ranging in size from
a pea to a golf ball, a wen is painless and feels soft but firm."
disease-general-oily-skin,Oily Skin,"TREATMENT
• Keep your skin clean. Beware of certain cosmetics; they aggravate a problem which
might not otherwise exist.
• Wash twice a day with soap; it was made to remove oil. Hot soapy water is even better.
Ivory soap is a more drying soap than many others. Scrub the skin with soap and water.
• Some people put mud masks on to remove oil.
• Avoid smoking; it increases the size of your skin pores and weakens the skin generally.
Fortunately, oily skin tends to age better than dry skin, producing less wrinkles. So count yourself
fortunate in one way.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God cares for our necessities, and His love and grace are continually flowing,
to satisfy our needs. In His care, we may safely rest.

SYMPTOMS—Excessively oily skin.
CAUSES—The sebaceous glands, which secrete oil onto the skin, produce more oil than they should.
The excess oil clogs pores. Heredity is a major cause, but diet and hormones affect it. Oil gland
secretions can be increased by stress, hormonal activity changes, hot weather, pregnancy, or taking
certain types of birth control pills.
The forehead, nose, chin, and upper back tend to have more sebaceous glands; hence can be the sites of
the most problems. Oily skin is most common among teenagers."
disease-general-prickly-heat,Prickly Heat,"TREATMENT
• Wash with mild soap, twice a day; apply apple cider vinegar (½ tsp. in glass of water) after the bath.
Take vitamin C orally (1,000 mg or more).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Too often we grieve our kind heavenly Father by our unbelief. If we will but
trust His guiding hand, all our difficulties will work to our best good.

SYMPTOMS—Skin feels hot and prickly.
CAUSES—Hot weather, dry skin, sweaty skin."
disease-general-rosacea,Rosacea,"TREATMENT
• Alcohol, stress, excessive heat or cold, sunlight, hot liquids, or spicy food may trigger a
reaction. It is believed that a B complex deficiency is involved, along with a poor diet,
resulting from too much junk food. Alcoholics, who perennially lack in B vitamins and
good food, often have reddened faces. Avoid commercial skin creams, etc.
• Once or twice a month, go on a short fast, to clean out the body. Eat nourishing food. Do
not drink hot liquids.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ—what a wonderful hope is set before
us! May we prove faithful every day. As we cling to Christ and, by His enabling grace, obey His Ten
Commandment law, we will rejoice in His light.

SYMPTOMS—A reddening of the skin, generally on the forehead, nose, cheekbones, and chin.
Pustules may appear on the nose, and are tender. The skin may thicken. Groups of small blood vessels,
close to the surface, become enlarged, resulting in blotchy red areas with small bumps. Pimples may
accompany the problem. The rosacea may disappear, or become permanent. Blackheads or whiteheads
are rarely present.
It often begins with a frequent flushing, or reddening, of the face. This is most often seen on the nose
and cheeks. A burning, or grittiness, in the eyes may be felt.
CAUSE—Rosacea, which usually begins in the 40s, is a skin disorder which can become chronic. It is
important that you try to eliminate the underlying causes, which are closely related to a wrong diet and
way of life.
People who flush easily are more likely to develop this problem. White women between 30-50 have it
the most. When men have it, the appearance of the face is worse, often accompanied by a roughened,
enlarged nose (rhinophyma)."
disease-general-enlarged-pores,Enlarged Pores,"TREATMENT
• Stop believing those ads which show beautiful people smoking. They only want to get
your money.
• After quitting all tobacco products, get on a good nutritional, exercise, and rest program.
Take vitamin-mineral supplements. Do not drink soft drinks or eat sugar, chocolate, potato
chips, or other junk foods.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All who enter into a covenant with Jesus Christ become, by adoption, the
children of God. They are cleansed from sin, as they submit to His rule and obey His Word. Ever trust
Him.

SYMPTOMS—Unsightly larger pores in the face and on the skin, which gives an appearance of
premature aging.
CAUSE—Using nicotine in any form."
disease-general-wrinkles,Wrinkles,"SYMPTOMS—Wrinkles on the face. The skin tells what is inside. If you have healthful, youthful, skin,
it is a good sign of a healthy body inside.
CAUSE—The skin loses its elasticity and suppleness. It becomes thinner and dryer. With age, wrinkles
are inevitable. But there are ways to avoid getting them earlier than necessary.
PREVENTION—
• Stay out of the sun. Avoid tanning booths; they produce the same wrinkling as the sun.
Wear a hat when out in the sunlight.
• Eat carefully of good food. Exercise, drink enough fluids, and get adequate sleep.
Pressing your face against a pillow adds more wrinkles. Do not scrunch up your face
when you talk; that makes new wrinkle patterns.
• Avoid alcohol and nicotine. Tobacco dramatically ages the skin! Smoking makes a 25-
year-old woman look like a 35-year-old! Smoking also decreases blood supply to the face
and skin.
• Dampen the skin and then apply a little vegetable oil, to lubricate it. That will help put
water and oil into your skin cells.
• Massage your face as the Orientals do. That tends to exercise the skin and facial muscles
and strengthen them.
Now, don't laugh, and I will give you more suggestions:
• To soften and nourish your skin, mash half an avocado and put it on your face. Leave it
there until it dries, and then wipe it off with water. Avocado has essential oils.
• To reduce puffiness under your eyes, place cool slices of cucumber over them for 10
minutes.
• To tighten and refine skin pores, whip an egg white and apply it to your face. After 15-
20 minutes (if you can still breathe), rinse it off with water.
• To remove dead surface skin cells and improve skin texture, Japanese women gently rub
a small handful of dry short-grain rice against their faces.
• To cleanse the pores, rub mashed tomato over your face.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Only to those who receive Jesus Christ as their Saviour are given the power to
become sons and daughters of God. By ourselves, we cannot overcome sin; but, in the strength of Christ
we can be overcomers."
disease-general-night-sweats,Night Sweats,"TREATMENT
• Not enough air in a room can cause you to break out in an abnormal sweat. Make sure a
current of air flows through your bed chamber when you are sleeping. It does not have to
be much, but you need a slight amount of moving fresh air. In some instances, there may
be enough air in the room; but, when you breathe out air, it tends to remain in a hollow
formed by the bedding. If necessary, breathe through your mouth. If you find that your
brain quickly feels better when you do this, then that is a significant way to solve your
problem.
• If you are not living right and eating right, then the sweating can be the result of a toxic
overload.
• Avoid meat, salt, tobacco, and junk food. Drink 2 oz. of green drink (whizzed up greens
in pineapple or apple juice) every day. Do not eat closer than four hours before bedtime.
Fast one day a week on distilled water or fruit and vegetable juices.
• Take Epsom salt (2 cups) baths every night, and hot/cold showers in the morning. After
the night sweats are past, take 10-minute cool baths in the morning, to tone the system.
• An alternative is to take a hot salt water sponge before retiring. Use 2 tbsp. salt per quart
of water. A hot bath followed by a salt glow is also good.
• You may have hot flashes, caused by irregular thyroid activity.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ alone has power to cleanse the heart. He alone can make you a child of
God. He can transform your life and bring you peace and happiness in the midst of every trial.

(Hyperhidrosis)
SYMPTOMS—Sweating during sleeping hours which seems abnormal. The sweating may begin all at
once.
CAUSES—There may be a lack of air in the sleeping room. The body may be eliminating toxins and
needs help. You may have a thyroid problem."
disease-general-body-odor,Body Odor,"(Bromhidrosis)
SYMPTOMS—The secretion of foul-smelling perspiration.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• A lack of soap and water applications causes the sweat to accumulate. Wash your body
more often, especially in the axial areas (under arms and groin), and change underwear
daily. Make sure your clothes are clean. Choose natural fabrics; cotton and wool enable
the absorbed sweat to evaporate from the body.
• Foot odors can be caused either by not changing the socks often enough or by wearing
rubber or plastic shoes. They will make your feet smell like an old rubber tire. The
problem may be the shoes, not your feet. Many people today wear such shoes, since they
are so much less expensive than leather ones.
• Body odors can also be caused by an excess of toxins in the body which it is trying to
eliminate. Are you eating too much or eating the wrong foods? Are you staying up late at
night, drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes? Apply a wet sheet pack overnight. It will
help pull the toxins out of a heavy meat eater. By morning, the sheet will be stained by the
eliminated poisons. Fast one day a week on juice or vegetable juices, or a water fast.
Epsom salt baths help the body eliminate toxins. Repeat daily for one week, and then
reduce to once a week.
• Not eating enough unsaturated fatty acids (quality vegetable oils) or not getting enough
zinc can also produce body odor.
• Take a tip from hunters who wash with pine soap, so their odor will not be detected by
wildlife. Another is old-fashioned glycerine soap.
• Another cause of body odor is excessive sexual activity.
• Pouring tomato juice on a dog to de-skunk him has been done for generations. Some
have found that they can pour some tomato juice in a tub of water, sit in it for a time,
shower off and get out—and they also smell fine!
ENCOURAGEMENT—The promise of sonship is made to all who believe on His name. Everyone
who comes to Jesus, in faith, will receive pardon and power to obey."
disease-general-skin-disorders,Skin Disorders,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
CHILBLAINS—Alternate Foot Bath; Revulsive Douche to feet; Alternate Douche; Hot Foot Bath,
followed by Foot Bath under flowing (cold) water; foot pack.
BURNS—The evaporating compress; the cool irrigating compress (cool, wet cloth over it to reduce heat
or sprinkle water over it [""irrigate""] to intensify the cooling effect); if very extensive, the prolonged or
continuous Neutral Bath.
ERYTHEMA—Cool evaporating compress or irrigating compress (explained just above); neutral
compress.
PRURITUS—Prolonged Neutral Bath; copious water drinking; large enema; daily aseptic dietary.
ERUPTIONS—If dry, not irritable, give prolonged Neutral Bath. If scaly, alkaline bath (soda bath or
Oatmeal Bath). If moist and irritable, cool evaporating compress moistened with soda solution (1 oz. to
1 gal.). If skin is thickened, as in chronic eczema, Hot or Alternate (hot and cold) spray Douche or
Compress, for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day. If extensively damaged skin (as in pemphigus, confluent
smallpox, bad burns), the Continuous Neutral Full Bath until the skin is healed. [Editor's note: One of
Jethro Kloss's workers personally told me that when his son was injured in an automobile accident, he
gave him a Continuous Bath (of water with goldenseal in it) for several days.]
JAUNDICE—Copious water drinking; large Enema twice daily; sweating hot bath for 15 minutes: such
as Radiant Heat Bath; Steam Bath; Hot Full Bath; Wet Sheet Pack, followed by prolonged Neutral Bath.
Give the sweating bath once daily, or even twice, if he is not too weak. For general tonic effects, apply
Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub twice daily. Alternate Hot and Cold Compress over the liver
twice daily, with Heating Compress over the liver or flannel-covered Hot Abdominal Pack during
intervals between.
DRY SKIN—Short sweating bath, such as Radiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath, hot-air bath, Hot Full Bath,
Hot Blanket Pack, Dry Pack, sweating Wet Sheet Pack, followed by a cold bath suited to his general
condition, and this followed by massage with friction.
HYPERHIDROSIS—Steam Bath, sweating Radiant Heat Bath, followed by Revulsive Douche to spine
and general Cold Douche.
SWEATING FEET—Revulsive Douche to feet, with extremes in temperature as great as possible;
alternate hot and cold Foot Bath, Heating Compress to feet during the night, with Cold Mitten Friction to
the feet, in the morning on rising."
disease-general-hives,Hives,"TREATMENT
Immediate help:
• Anything that is alkaline generally helps the itching. Place a calcium gluconate paste on
the skin or apply milk, calamine, or milk of magnesia.
• Cold compresses or cool baths will immediately help also.
• An oatmeal or bran bath will help relieve the itching. Place 2 lbs. of ether in a muslin
bag and set in a hot bath (104o-106o F.).
• A paste of cream of tartar and water can be applied to the area.
Longer term solutions:
• Try to find the cause or causes of this problem. Here are some of the things which result
in hives in others:
• Stress, food allergy (milk, wheat, eggs, shellfish, pork, onions, some fruits), chlorine in
drinking water, adrenal exhaustion and/or liver congestion resulting from an allergy,
hydrochloric acid deficiency, food dyes, preservatives, drug allergy, acid conditions,
insect stings, chronic infection, penicillin in the milk you drink, aspirin, coffee, alcohol,
and tobacco.
• Secondary factors will be spinal lesions, stoppage of lymph flow, imbalance between
deep and surface blood circulation, and adrenal exhaustion.
• Another factor is improperly (too hurriedly) weaning a child from breast milk.
• Reading over the above lists, it appears that the primary cause is frequently a physical
reaction to a substance which the body cannot tolerate to have put into it. We live in a
chemical age. One cannot even drive down the highway without breathing dangerous
fumes.
• Do not use steroids, alcohol, or processed foods.
• Lymph stasis and poor circulation may result from poor skin function, lack of exercise,
fresh air, and poor elimination; but ingesting poisonous substances top the list.
• Aside from trying to find the chemical offenders, prolonged fasting is generally
considered the best method of terminating recurrent hives. This cleans out the body and
enables it to better deal with the chemicals it is daily confronted with. Fasting will help the
intestines and other organs to heal. It will eliminate toxins and help the bowels begin
working properly again. Trunk packs will help induce sweating. Moderate sunbaths will
help also.
• As a rule, fasting should not be over 1-3 days in length. If you are overweight, longer
fasts might be considered. If you are thin, never go over 3 days; indeed, one meal or 1 day
fasts are best for frail individuals. A carrot, beet, and green vegetable juice fast is better
than a straight water fast.
• Use enemas during the fast, and even afterward, until the hives do not return. Maintain
good bowel action thereafter.
• Also important are dietary changes: Be sure and get nutritional supplements, including
vitamins A, B complex, B6, B12, C, and calcium. You may need to take hydrochloric acid
with meals.
• There is one other cause which we have not yet mentioned: a lack of unsaturated fatty
acids. The best is wheat germ oil. Flaxseed oil is also outstanding. But corn oil would be
acceptable. In addition to including only such oils in your diet, you would do well to rub
wheat germ oil on the affected area.
• When the problem exists for weeks or months, it is vital that you identify the cause, so
you can eliminate the hives.
• Chronic hives can be linked to candida.
• When severe anaphylactic reactions occur, immediately take the person to the hospital. It
is best not to let situations come to such a crisis. Solve the problem before hives produces
such an emergency.
—Also see ""Skin Disorders.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—In the work of redemption, God has revealed His love in sacrifice, a sacrifice
so broad and deep and high that it is immeasurable. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son—that you and I could have eternal life!

(Urticaria)
SYMPTOMS—Strong itching (pruritus) may suddenly occur. Elevated wheals result, along with
swollen eyes. The subsequent scratching makes you appear swollen and scratchy. The intense itchy
wheals which may result may disappear in minutes, hours, or several days. Hives are generally gone
within 1-7 days, except in cases of severe hypersensitivity, when death may result. Occasionally a fatal
anaphylactic reaction occurs. At such times, edema of the breathing passages produces respiratory
difficulty similar to severe asthma.
CAUSES—The skin is reacting to allergies, physical irritation, stress, or emotions. Special dermal cells
begin releasing histamine, which causes internal blood vessels to leak fluid into the deepest layers of the
skin.
Meat; dairy; and poultry products, especially in frozen or fast foods, are frequent causes of hives. This is
due to the chemicals, antibiotics, and hormones given to farm animals.
Here is a list of special things known to cause hives in some people:
Aspirin, antimony or bismuth (in various metal alloys), anti-pyrine or phenacetin (pain relievers),
barbiturates, BHA and BHT (preservatives), phenobarbital or chloral hydrate (sedatives),
chlorpromazine and meprobamate (tranquilizers), fluoride (dental products and fluoridated drinking
water), food colorings, griseofulvin (antifungal), insulin, liver extract, menthol (in perfumes, candy,
cigarettes), mercury (dental fillings), morphine, penicillin, pilocarpine (glaucoma medication),
preservatives, procaine (anesthetic, known as novocaine), quinine, (quinine water and malaria
medication), reserpine (heart medication), saccharin (artificial sweetener), salicylates (flavoring and
preservative), sulfites (preservative in dried fruit), and thiamine hydrochloride (cough medications)."
disease-general-impetigo,Impetigo,"TREATMENT
• Impetigo is actually an early sign of immune depression, which allows organisms
normally on everyone's skin to produce disease. The body needs to be built up.
• Proper nutrition is needed, along with sanitary living conditions.
• In some individuals, a food allergy (such as milk, wheat, or soy) or a contact dermatitis
(such as detergents in the clothes) weakens the immune system—permitting the impetigo
to gain a foothold.
• Strict hygiene is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection to other parts of the
body—or to other people.
• Vitamin A is necessary for good skin health. Give the child a good multivitamin
supplement. Give vitamin C, to bowel tolerance.
• Put a wash of boric acid and herbs such as comfrey, golden seal, or echinacea on the
affected area.
• Place garlic oil, squeezed from capsules, on the area.
• Removal of the crusts results in a more rapid cure. Bathing in soapy water every 4 hours
during the day is helpful. Severe cases may require a slightly salty or hydrogen peroxide
application (3 parts water to 1 part 3% peroxide). Apply soaks or warm compresses to the
attached crusts. Hot and cold compresses may be applied after the crusts are gone. At
night, charcoal poultices can be attached and left overnight.
• Use disposable tissues instead of cloth handkerchiefs. Each person should be given his
own towel and washcloth. Wash the hands frequently; and, while the infection lasts, keep
the fingernails short and clean. Change pillowcases and bed sheets daily, and boil all
linens for 10 minutes. If possible, isolate the child.
• Exposure to the air and sunlight will help, but do not swim.
• If impetigo is on the scalp, cut the hair so you can treat it.
—Also see ""Skin Disorders.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—God gave His Son to become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. The gift
of God to man is beyond all computation. Nothing was withheld. God has done, and is doing, everything
possible to save us from sin.

(Impetigo Contagiosa; Echthyma)
SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—Impetigo is not something to ignore. Neglected, it can produce boils,
ulcers, or other skin complications.
Untreated, it can result in deep infections of the tissue beneath the skin. Impetigo is a skin disease
caused by a streptococcal bacteria. It occurs primarily in children, especially in undernourished ones,
and in the summer months. Lower economic groups living in crowded conditions are the most likely to
contract it. It is more frequently found on the face, hands, and arms next and feet and legs third.
Cuts, abrasions, insect bites, and stings allow entry of the bacteria. An area of redness is seen, followed
by blister-like swellings. The fluid is straw colored. If not scratched, the lesions break down in 4-6 days
and form a honey-colored crust which heals slowly. The skin beneath may lose its color, not to be
regained for months. The scratching generally results in more skin injury and a spread of the infection."
disease-general-shingles,Shingles,"TREATMENT
• Massive doses of vitamins C (1,000 mg 3 times a day and 200 mg 5-6 times a day),
rutin, and B complex. In addition, take vitamin F, calcium, and lecithin. The amino acid,
lysine, can help inhibit the spread of the herpes virus. The diet must include raw fruits and
vegetables, brewer's yeast, brown rice, and whole grains. Be sure and eat enough protein.
• Some suggest leaving the blisters alone if they are not too bothersome. Other suggestions
include placing one or more of the following on them: calamine or other calcium
preparation on them. Calcium is always soothing to skin rash conditions. Apply vitamin E
oil from a capsule to the area.
• Put cold water on a cloth and place it over the area. The cooler it is, the better it feels.
Avoid anything that will make your blistered skin hotter.
• Put apple cider vinegar on it daily. Take hot baths 2-3 times a week. Take a starch bath
(one cup of cornstarch or colloidal oatmeal) into a hot tub. Colloidal oatmeal is powdered,
and is at the pharmacy. Do not slip in the tub!
• Clean out the bowels frequently. Light fruit and vegetable fasts will also help clean out,
and strengthen, the body. Wear only cotton clothing while the condition exists.
• Dab the infection with hydrogen peroxide to purify it. If pain exists after the blisters are
gone, put ice on the area.
• Avoid drafts. Allow sunlight on the area for short intervals. Gently wash the blisters
when bathing and avoid touching or scratching them.
• If the shingles appear on the forehead, tip of the nose, or near the eyes, contact an
ophthalmologist. Such cases can lead to blindness.
—Also see ""Skin Disorders.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—As John thought of the love of Christ, he was led to exclaim, ""Behold, what
manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God."" Oh, may
we praise Him every day for the overcoming strength He imparts, so we can resist temptation and fulfill
His will.

(Herpes Zoster)
SYMPTOMS—Sharp, burning pain along a nerve route somewhere in your body for 3-4 days. There
are angry red blisters at that pain site several days later. These are very painful and itchy. Later the
bumps blister, turn cloudy, and form scabs. It usually lasts 7-14 days from the time the blisters appear
before the scabs drop off. This is no ordinary rash; it is shingles, which is a viral infection of a nerve. It
most often occurs on the skin of the abdomen, under the ribs and above the navel. But it can appear
anywhere on the body. It most frequently occurs after the age of 50.
If shingles starts near an eye, beware! The cornea can become infected and blindness may result. You
would then do well to consult an eye specialist.
CAUSES—This staphylococcal infection consists of small round bacteria growing in clusters. The virus
in the chickenpox you had as a child never really left your body; and, when you are an adult, it comes
back in the form of shingles. The virus may lie dormant in the spinal cord and nerve ganglia for years
until triggered. It normally lives on the nostrils and skin of everybody.
What triggers the attack? It is known that poisonous substances in food, metals, drugs, and other toxic
substances can do it. For example, risk of shingles increases with the use of anti-cancer drugs. Anything
that weakens the immune system can bring on an attack of shingles. Once it occurs, the pain can
continue on for months or years. So it is better to prevent an attack."
disease-general-keratosis,Keratosis,"TREATMENT
• Take vitamin A supplementation. This should be 25,000 units per day, for children, or
30,000 units per day, for adults. However, keep in mind that vitamin A can be dangerous;
since it is an oil-soluble vitamin, it is normally stored quite well by the body. Many
experts recommend never taking over 50,000 units a day, and only for a limited period of
time.
• Increase zinc to 50 mg, three times a day, and essential fatty acids to 5 gm, three times a
day.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Give God the most precious offering that it is possible for you to give: Give
Him your heart. He offers to make you a member of His family, a child of the heavenly King. What
earthly inheritance can equal this!

(Sharkskin)
SYMPTOMS—This is the rough ""goose bump"" skin you will find on your elbows, and also on the
backs of your arms, thighs, and buttocks. It feels like a sandpaper surface.
CAUSES—This is a sebaceous and keratinized build up of hard granular plugs in the openings of hair
follicles. Many physicians claim that this is a normal condition, but it is actually a deficiency of vitamin
A and zinc."
disease-general-leukoderma,Leukoderma,"TREATMENT
• B complex supplementation, plus emphasis on two special B vitamins: Para-amino
benzoic acid (PABA, 100 mg four times a day) and pantothenic acid. PABA injections
may be needed. Also be sure and take hydrochloric acid if it is needed.
• Other helpful nutrients include vitamins A, B complex, B12, zinc, and copper.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We need a living faith. We must know that Jesus is indeed ours; that His Spirit
is purifying and refining our hearts, and enabling us to keep the Ten Commandments. May we press
closer to our God, so He can fulfill His will more fully in our lives.
Section 3
Extremities
Part 1
Extremities

(Vitiligo)
SYMPTOMS—This is a loss of skin color, especially in black or dark-skinned people. When occurring
in Europeans, it is less likely to be noticed. It is most commonly seen as white patches, surrounded by a
dark border.
CAUSES—The skin is no longer producing melanin, the dark coloring pigment. It most frequently
occurs to someone who has thyroid problems. Premature gray or white hair may also occur. All this
points to a deficiency of certain B complex vitamins.
When treatment is effective, small spots of pigment will appear in the white patches, and then gradually
fill in. But only a few experience a complete return to the original color."
disease-general-numb-extremities,Numb Extremities,"SYMPTOMS—There is a ""going to sleep"" feeling in the toes, fingers, arms, or legs.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• Aside from serious nerve diseases, this temporary condition usually results from
pinching off the nerve and blood supply to an extremity.
• Avoid tight clothing and strained positions.
• Be sure and get an adequate supply of the B complex vitamins, including B .
6
• A water treatment useful for numb, tingling feet would be a fomentation given to the
spine, along with hot or alternate sponging of the limbs. This is repeated 3 times each day.
ENCOURAGEMENT—How lovingly the angels of God guard His earthly children who cry to Him
for help. You cannot now understand all the mysteries of Providence; but, by faith, you can know that all
things work together for your best good."
disease-general-felon,Felon,"TREATMENT
• Call a physician and have the felon lanced. Deep lancing through very painful flesh must
be done, so it may be necessary for the patient to be anesthetized.
• An alternate remedy, used by the old timers on the frontier is as follows: Warm some
kerosene and immerse the affected part into it for at least 10-15 minutes at a time, 4-5
times a day. This will eliminate the felon.
• To relieve pain, put a piece of lemon on it. If on the end of a finger, cut a small hole in
the lemon and place it over the finger. If elsewhere, bandage on a thick slice. This may
solve the problem, if kerosene is not available.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Those who take the name of Christian should come to God in earnestness and
humility, pleading for help. Jesus has told us to pray without ceasing. And so many need our prayers.

(Whitlow)
SYMPTOMS—A swelling on an abscess of a thumb or finger (sometimes a toe), which includes
throbbing pain and extreme tenderness. It may, at first, seem to be an infection or inflammation of the
skin.
CAUSES—The germs causing the infection are usually carried under the skin by a deep pinprick, thorn,
sliver, or some other sharp object. The inflammation and pus are deep among the tendons, tendon
sheaths, or even next to the bone.
If the felon is not carefully, and thoroughly, lanced promptly, the tendons could slough or the bone be
damaged. This would result in a permanently crippled body part.
Moreover, if the pus is not drained, there is danger that the infection may travel to the hand and more
extensive crippling occur, or the infection may infect the blood, and blood poisoning will result. (See
Blood Poisoning.)"
disease-general-erythromelalgia,Erythromelalgia,"TREATMENT
• Let the patient rest. Elevate the affected part. Place a cold compress on it, and change
this every 20-30 minutes. Apply graduated tonic frictions, such as the wet hand rub, the
cold mitten friction, or the cold towel rub. See the author's book, Water Therapy Manual
(see order sheet), for further information on how to apply these treatments.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Let your affections center upon God. Think of His goodness, and let His Spirit
guide you into deeper obedience to His Ten Commandment law.

SYMPTOMS—A skin neurosis, accompanied by burning and throbbing which comes and goes, and
affects any of the extremities, but especially the feet.
CAUSES—Although this is a nerve problem, it is listed here because it rather consistently affects the
extremities."
disease-general-gangrene,Gangrene,"TREATMENT
• Consult a physician. In addition to primary treatment for the condition causing the
gangrene, the following suggestions will help:
• Eat nourishing food, and drop all junk food.
• Stop eating all meat, tobacco, alcohol, and nearly all salt. Eat a high fiber vegetarian diet
with complex starches. It should be a low protein, low fat diet. Eat kelp, to strengthen the
thyroid. Drink carrot juice. Take 50,000 units of vitamin A daily.
• Take an enema and powdered psyllium seed in water daily, to assure good bowel
movements.
• If the skin is dry, lightly rub wheat germ or olive oil on it. When pus is oozing, dab
warm hydrogen peroxide on, and wipe off carefully.
• Try to keep walking or massage the area (usually the legs), to improve circulation.
• Apply cool leg baths or cool whole baths. Chaparral tea or apple cider vinegar can be
added to the water, to help disinfect it (1 tbsp. per quart). Also helpful are alternate hot
and cold foot baths or fomentation packs, to improve blood flow.
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is difficult to exercise living faith when we are discouraged. Yet this, of all
others, is the very time when we should exercise faith. When you have the greatest need, that is the time
to seek God the most earnestly. He will hear, He will answer, He will help.

SYMPTOMS—The skin darkens, and either remains soft and moist or becomes dry and shrivels.
Eventually it sloughs off. Gas gangrene can occur in a wound where certain bacteria are present.
CAUSES—Death and decay of body tissue is caused when the blood supply is cut off or as a result of
certain bacterial infections."
disease-general-raynaud-s-disease,Raynaud'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• Keep hands and feet warm. This is important. It might be well to select a warmer climate
in which to live. Always wear gloves in cold weather (mittens will keep you even
warmer). Wear shoes; do not walk without them when it is cooler. Wear extra warm socks
in the winter. Dress warmly at all times. Gloves, mittens, and shoes should be warm
before putting them on, since it is difficult for one with this problem to warm them. Wear
shoes which breathe, so you do not end up with damp, cold feet. Wear a warm hat in cold
weather.
• Avoid contact with cold objects, even for brief moments. While preparing meals, use
tepid, not cold, water.
• When an attack occurs, immerse the body part in warm (not hot) water, no warmer than
90o F. Why not warmer water? During an attack, without realizing it, one's skin can more
easily burn.
• Massaging the hands and fingers every evening helps reduce the severity of the attacks,
by stimulating blood circulation in that area.
• Stressful situations produce a spasm of the blood vessels. As much as possible, avoid
such situations. Keep calm, cheerful, and relaxed. Plan ahead and avoid scheduling
pressures. Trust in God and believe He will care for you. Vigorous outdoor exercise will
strengthen the entire body, and also relax it. Exercise tends to neutralize the attitude and
effects of stress.
• Avoid fatty and fried foods, all junk foods. At least 50% of your diet should be raw food.
Avoid food items which tend to bother you (allergenic foods). Avoid caffeine (caffeine,
tea, soft drinks, chocolate). Caffeine restricts blood flow. Use a fat-free, sugar-free diet.
Sugar increases blood viscosity as well as triglycerides. Avoid food seasonings.
• Do not take any tobacco product or use alcohol. Nicotine causes constriction of the
blood vessels and it produces plaque in them, both of which reduce blood flow. Do not be
even in the same room where someone is smoking.
• Medicinal drugs for Raynaud's do not seem to help. The side effects outweigh the
benefits (ergot, beta blocking drugs, cytotoxic agents, etc.). Do not take birth control pills.
• Avoid machinery which vibrates the hands. In one study, 50% of pneumatic drill
workers had Raynaud's, compared with 5.6% for the average population. Such equipment
includes chain saws, metal grinders, stone cutters, lathes, and manual typewriters.
• Drink enough water, but not soft drinks. Eat a high fiber diet which includes some
psyllium seed, to help clean the colon. Eat slow-cooked grains and a low protein diet.
• Take vitamin E (80-1,200 unites per day), unsaturated fatty acids alone (wheat germ oil,
etc.), tryptophan.
• Take calcium (2,000 mg daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg daily). Get enough iron in
your diet. (webmaster's Note: It is reported that Zinc is also very helpful in this condition.
see http://coldcure.com/html/zinc-angina.pdf )
• Sprinkle a small amount of cayenne on your food, to increase circulation. Other helpful
herbs include garlic, ginkgo, biloba extract, and pau d'arco.
• Sunbathing is also helpful, for it strengthens both the body and the blood.
• One physician (Donald McIntyre) suggests occasionally swinging the arms in circles, 80
twirls per minute, to throw blood into the hands. He says to do it as a pitcher does it:
swinging the arm up from the back and then hard downward in front. It has been found
that those with back problems can swing their arms entirely in front of the body with the
same beneficial effect on the hands (upward in the trunk and downward to the side).
—Also see ""Buerger's Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Talk with Jesus as though He were right by your side. If there is a place you
cannot go with Jesus, then do not go there. If there is anything you cannot watch or listen to with Him,
then turn away from it immediately.

SYMPTOMS—The small arteries in the extremities constrict or tighten. The hands and feet are
extremely sensitive to the cold, and suddenly contract. Lack of oxygenated blood causes the fingers or
toes to become whitish or bluish in hue. As a result, the affected area may temporarily shrink in size!
Unless these attacks are reduced, ulcers may form, which further damage the tissue and produce chronic
infection under, and near, the fingernails and toenails.
The hands are the areas most often affected. But it can occur in the fingers and possibly toes, nose,
tongue, cheeks, ears, or chin. The blood spasm may initially blanch the area. Tingling, and then
swelling, may occur and become painful. The appearance may change to a bright red, as the blood
vessels again distend and fresh blood is sent back into the area.
The attacks usually do not last long. But, in those instances in which they do, gangrene can develop.
CAUSES—A cold attack is generally brought on by exposure to cold or emotional upset. The hands go
into the refrigerator for a moment, a difficult written exam must be taken, or a verbal conflict occurs.
Spasms of small arteries result.
The underlying cause may be less easy to identify. It might be high blood pressure, drugs, connective
tissue disease, inflammation of the arteries, or equipment vibrations which injure the blood vessels.
Some individuals have lived in a cold, improperly heated environment for too many months or years,
and the problem developed. Try to avoid resting or sleeping in ice cold places.
Food allergies, junk food, or a poor diet which is high in starches and low in greens, vitamins, and
minerals may cause it.
Apparently the cause is not a ""thoracic inlet syndrome""; that is, squeezing of nerves or arteries issuing
from the thorax by muscles or bones.
Instead of Raynaud's, you might have Buerger's disease (a nerve disorder which gradually cuts off nerve
supply to the extremities). Buerger's disease is primarily caused by using tobacco products. (Buerger's is
a steady cutting off of nerve flow; whereas Raynaud's is an intermittent blood flow.)
Antihypertensives, ergot drugs, channel blockers, or alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers can be the
cause.
There are two forms of this condition:
(1) Raynaud's phenomenon: This may be due to various bodily disorders. It occurs evenly
in both men and women, and usually begins after the age of 30. Symptoms in the
phenomenon may affect only one side of the body.
(2) Raynaud's disease: This is primary disease, and occurs mainly in women. The disease
generally begins in the teens or early twenties. But it can occur at any time in the life.
Attacks normally affect both sides of the body equally.
Frequency of the attacks are significant: They may be rare or occur as often as several times a day. Mild
occurrences only last a few minutes; severe ones may continue for hours. Between attacks the hands will
at first appear normal; later they may remain slightly bluish. Gradually the attacks will be more frequent
and last longer.
In later years, the hands will be slightly bluish all the time. The fingers become swollen. The skin turns
pale, discolored, shiny, taut, and smooth. The nails become clubbed and deformed. In advanced stages,
poor blood supply can weaken the fingers and damage the sense of touch. The sense of feel may
decrease and delicate movements become more difficult to perform. Infections and gangrene may occur
more frequently in the affected area."
disease-general-buerger-s-disease,Buerger'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• Stop using nicotine in every form; it is killing you in more ways than one.
• Use the treatment outlined for Raynaud's disease. Walking is one of the best exercises
for increasing blood flow in the legs.
• Lie on the bed and elevate the legs for 1-2 minutes or until they blanch. Then sit on the
side of the bed and hold them down till they become pink. Do this 5 times each, 3 times a
day.
• Do not sit for long periods of time without getting up and walking. Sleep on a firm
mattress. Never cross the legs at the knees.
—Also see ""Raynaud's Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—When we learn to walk by faith and not by feeling, we shall have help from
God just when we need it, and His peace will come into our hearts.

Nails

(Thromboangiitis Obliterans)
SYMPTOMS—Continual coldness of the extremity is frequently the first symptom. But numbness,
tingling, and aching may also be noticed. When lowered for long periods of time, the feet may turn blue.
The problem generally begins in the feet; but it can, and will, occur in the hands and eventually the
whole, body—if the cause is not stopped.
Jews develop this problem more frequently than anyone else, and 75 men have it for every one woman
who develops it. It most frequently begins at the ages of 20 to 45. There are alternate periods of
worsening and inactivity of the disease.
CAUSES—This is an inflammation of the blood vessel walls, accompanied by blood clots and
thickening of the blood vessel walls. Eventually they close entirely.
The primary cause is the use of tobacco products. Rarely does a non-nicotine user get it."
disease-general-nail-problems,Nail Problems,"TREATMENT
• Supply the indicated deficiencies, listed above, which apply to you.
• Eat a high-protein diet, including Brewer's yeast, calcium, silica, and, if necessary,
hydrochloric acid.
• Water causes the nails to swell and they shrink when dry, resulting in loose, brittle nails.
• Avoid immersing the hands in detergent water.
• Never cut the cuticles. This damages the nail and invites infections. Do not push them
back.
• Brittle nails are common among teenagers, pregnant women, and those with food
allergies. The problem is malabsorption or nutritional deficiencies (unsaturated essential
fatty acids, amino acids, calcium, iron, or zinc).
• Hangnails are caused by an essential fatty acid deficiency. Put vitamin E oil or aloe vera
directly on it, to reduce further breaking and likelihood of infection. They are particularly
common among women who have their hands in water a lot or who bite their nails. Keep
nails clipped short. Rub vegetable oil into the hands occasionally.
• If you tend to pick at your nails, wear clothes with pockets; and, when you find yourself
starting to do it, put your hands in your pockets.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If we commit the keeping of our souls to God by living faith, His promises
will not fail us. We are limited only through our lack of faith, submission, and obedience.

SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—Your fingernails help reveal how well you are absorbing nutrients, and
whether you are getting enough. A deficiency of protein or other nutrients can affect the nails.
Surprisingly enough, finger and toe nails are composed almost entirely of protein. Here are some of the
symptoms, followed by the deficient nutrient:
Poor nail growth: zinc.
Dry, brittle nails: protein, vitamin A, calcium, iron.
Fragile and showing horizontal or vertical ridges: B vitamins.
Half moons absent: protein deficiency.
Thin, flat, and even moon-shaped (concave or spoon-shaped) nails: iron deficiency.
Pale nail beds: anemia.
Poor nail growth: zinc deficiency.
Excessive dryness, very rounded and curved nail ends, and darkened nails: vitamin B
12
deficiency.
Splitting nails: lack of hydrochloric acid, sulfur amino acid deficiency.
Washboard ridges: Iron, calcium, zinc deficiency.
Hangnails: Protein, folic acid, and vitamin C deficiencies.
White bands on the nails: protein deficiency.
White nails: liver disease, copper excess.
White spots: zinc deficiency, thyroid deficiency, and hydrochloric acid deficiency.
Fungus under nails: lack of lactobacillus in colon.
Bluish nails: chronic lung conditions (not enough oxygen)."
disease-general-ingrown-nails,Ingrown Nails,"TREATMENT
• Soak your foot in warm water, to soften the nail. Dry carefully and then insert a tiny
(tiny) wisp of sterile cotton under the burrowing edge of the nail. This will slightly lift the
nail, so it can grow past the tissue. Apply some peroxide as a safeguard against infection.
Change the cotton insert daily, until the nail has grown past the problem area.
• Do not cut a ""v""-shaped wedge out of the center of your toenail! It only worsens the
problem. Nails grow from back to front, not from inward to outward, or vice-versa.
• If you accidentally cut or break a nail too short, carefully smooth the edges with an
emery board.
• Never cut nails with scissors; none are small enough to do the job right, and they often
leave a sharp edge.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Prayer and faith can do what no power on earth could ever accomplish. In
Christ, we can resist temptation and obey the Ten Commandments.
Section 3
Extremities
Part 3
Feet

SYMPTOMS—The nail (usually on the big toe) has pushed into the soft tissue alongside it. Soon it
results in sharp pain. Infection can result.
CAUSES—Wear large enough shoes! This is the underlying problem for many cases of ingrown nails!
If you cannot solve the problem otherwise, cut out the front of the shoe! Podiatrists know that people
who wear shoes which are large enough rarely have food problems.
Never cut your nails too short! Cut them straight across, but not rounded. The outside edge of the nail
should be parallel to the skin. Do not trim the nail deeper than the tip of the toe."
disease-general-foot-problems,Foot Problems,"HYDRO—The following are summaries of discussions in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see
order sheet):
Numbness in feet: Give a hot Fomentation to the spine, accompanied by Hot or Alternate Sponging of
the limbs. Repeat this 3 times a day (p. 179).
Sweating feet: Apply a Revulsive Douche to the feet, with extremes in temperature as great as possible.
Give an Alternate hot and cold Foot Bath. During the night, apply a Heating Compress to the feet; and
give a Cold Mitten Friction to the feet in the morning, on arising (p. 243).
Weak, pronated feet: Put the feet and part of the legs in tubs for Contrast Baths. Begin with a
temperature of 110o F., and then after four minutes, change to tap water for 1 minute. Change back and
forth 4-6 times, and end with the hot water. During the treatment, the temperature of the hot water
should be gradually raised to 115o-120o F., and the tap water gradually lowered to the temperature of ice
water. Give the treatment twice a day (p. 115).
Infections in feet: Give the same treatment as for pronated feet, above (p. 114).
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is Jesus that we need. His presence and help must be ours continually. God
wants every one of us perfect in Christ. Through His strengthening grace, we can overcome sin and the
devil."
disease-general-corns-and-calluses,Corns And Calluses,"TREATMENT
• Wear proper shoes! Never wear tight-fitting footwear!
• Do not use ""corn plasters."" These contain acids intended to eat away at the corns. But
they also eat into nearby normal flesh.
• Do not cut corns and calluses! This only makes the situation worse. This especially
applies to diabetics. As soon as a corn develops, apply oil to soften it.
• Soak your feet in very diluted chamomile tea. It will both soothe and soften the hard
skin. (The stain the tea makes on the feet will come off easily with soap and water.) Or
just soak the feet in comfortably hot water for several minutes. Then apply a hand cream
which contains 20% urea. This will help dissolve the hard skin. Do this daily.
• Another formula is to soak the area in a mixture of oil of wintergreen, witch hazel, and
black walnut tincture, daily. Use a pumice stone and emery board to trim down the corn or
callus.
• Yet another formula is to crush 5-6 aspirin tablets and mix into a paste, by adding a half
teaspoon each of water and lemon juice. Apply this to the hard-skin areas. Put the foot in a
plastic bag, wrap a warm towel around it, and sit for 10 minutes. Then unwrap the foot
and scrub the area with a pumice stone. The dead, hardened flesh should come loose and
flake off.
• Put a few drops of citric acid on the area. The next morning, use an emery board or a
pumice stone and rub off the dead skin.
• A variant method is to soak a piece of cotton in fresh lemon juice or pineapple. Bandage
the cotton over the area. It will dissolve it. But you must be persistent.
• Any sweet oil rubbed on the area several times a day, plus the use of the emery board or
pumice stone, will skim off the dead flesh.
• Try putting some lamb's wool between the toes, to separate them (after buying larger
shoes).
• You can purchase Stella's Stretch All (or another leather-stretching solution) from a shoe
store. Apply it to the shoes and then walk in them while wet. Repeat this frequently, and
the leather shoe will widen out.
• Women should never wear high-heel shoes. They ruin the feet, damage the spine, and
throw the pelvic organs out of place.
• Women should not wear pumps; these are shoes which cause the foot to slide forward,
jamming everything into the front. Instead, wear an oxford-style shoe, with laces. This
properly cradles the foot.
• Always buy shoes which breathe; leather is the best.
• An undersized shoe will damage the toes and cause corns, etc. An oversized shoe will
produce friction and break the skin. But, of the two, oversized shoes are the less harmful.
• Some calluses are useful, never painful, and should not be disturbed.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We are seldom placed in the same position twice. There are continually new
experiences to be encountered. But, if we will trust in Christ, He will enable us to overcome sin in spite
of all that comes our way.

SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—Pressure and rubbing causes calluses on the bottoms and sides of the
feet. They can also form on the hands, and even on the elbows and knees.
Corns form between toes and remain soft from foot perspiration. They occur from the rubbing of
adjacent digit bones.
Corns are more painful than calluses."
disease-general-foot-aches,Foot Aches,"TREATMENT
• Improve the diet, get enough protein, calcium, and B vitamins. Stop eating junk food. It
isn't worth taking the time to chew and swallow.
• Lose that excess weight. It is hard on your feet.
• Elevate your feet when you come home at night. Then soak them in a basin of warm
water, containing 1-2 tbsp. of Epsom salts. Rinse with clear, cool water.
• Sit on the edge of the bathtub and alternately run comfortably hot water over your feet,
and then cold water, ending with the cold. (If you have diabetes, be careful about extremes
in temperature.)
• Wrap some ice cubes in a wet washcloth and rub it over your feet and ankles for a few
minutes.
• During the day, lift one foot and give it a good shake. Then lift the other and do likewise.
Then relax and flex your toes up and down.
• When standing in one place, keep changing your stance; try to keep moving about. If
possible, stand on a carpet or a rubber mat. Ask the boss if you can buy a rubber mat and
lay it down on the floor in your work area.
• Remove your shoes, sit in a chair, and stretch your feet out. Then, below the ankle, move
each foot in ten circles. Point your toes down and then up.
• Gently roll your foot over a golf ball, tennis ball, or rolling pin for a couple minutes.
• Scatter a few pencils on the floor and pick them up with your toes.
• For a terrific foot massage, toss a handful of beans in a moccasin-style shoe, and walk
around the room on them.
• Always wear low shoes, and shoes which fasten firmly.
• In the evening, sit down and put on a pair of soft slippers.
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is a part of God's plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that
which He would not bestow did we not thus ask. Oh, please, my friend, believe and know that God is
your best Friend!

SYMPTOMS—Tired, aching feet.
CAUSES—Inadequate diet and rest, and being on the feet all day long."
disease-general-foot-odor,Foot Odor,"TREATMENT
• Wash your feet frequently. Keep them clean. Scrub gently with a soft brush, including
between the toes. Dry them well when finished.
• Put cornstarch in your shoes to help keep them dry. (Never use talcum powder for
anything; it is cancer forming if it gets into the body.)
• Do not use antiperspirants, for they contain aluminum (a cause of Alzheimer's disease).
Spray deodorants are breathed into the lungs.
• Change your socks often, several times a day if necessary. This is one of the best things
you can do.
• Some find help in wearing two pairs of socks at a time. This increases elimination of
sweat.
• Buy leather shoes that breathe. This reduces the perspiration. Avoid rubber shoes; they
cause your feet to smell like rubber tires at the end of the day—yet the odor is not from
the feet! Even expensive rubber shoes, endorsed by the athletes, can do this.
• Soak your feet (15 minutes, twice a week) in ½ cup vinegar added to 1 quart of water.
• Soak them in alternate hot and cold water pans or pails. But if you are diabetic or have
impaired circulation, you had better not do this.
• Sprinkle some dry, crumbled sage leaves into your shoes, to control odor.
• Avoid stress; it increases sweating, which multiplies bacterial action.
• Avoid spicy, pungent foods, for their odor will be found in your feet later on.
ENCOURAGEMENT—To love as Christ loved means to reveal unselfishness at all times and in all
places, by kind words and pleasant looks. The Lord will help every one of us where we need help the
most in overcoming and conquering self.

SYMPTOMS—Feet that do not smell very nice.
CAUSES—Bacteria on the feet, cheap shoes, or eating meat."
disease-general-flat-feet,Flat Feet,"TREATMENT
• Try walking barefoot upstairs on your toes, and then back down the same way. Do this
10 minutes each day, for a month; and eat a nourishing, moderate diet. The muscles in
your feet may strengthen. By helping your flat feet, your eyesight may also improve.
• If you cannot solve your flat foot problem (perhaps because it occurred when you were a
child, and you did not discover it till later), learn to adapt your step to it. When you take a
step, land very slightly on the outer rear portion of the foot; then, as the foot moves back,
keep the weight slightly (very slightly) on the outer part of the foot. In this way, you will
make an artificial arch and your foot will not tire as quickly throughout the day. In
addition, try to do part of your everyday work while sitting down occasionally. This will
help rest the feet.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We may speak with Jesus wherever we may be. There is no time or place
where prayer cannot be offered. Prayer rises above the noise of machinery and traffic. We are speaking
to God, and He hears us.

SYMPTOMS—The concave arch supporting the bottom of the feet is flattening out, resulting in more
exhaustion during the day when you are on your feet.
CAUSES—Inadequate circulation, impoverished diet, and junk food is often involved. Once this
problem develops it generally is not solved, especially since it often occurs in childhood when parents
are not aware of what is happening until it is too late."
disease-general-athlete-s-foot,Athlete'S Foot,"TREATMENT
• Keep your feet dry. After bathing, dry carefully between the toes. Wear cotton socks,
and change them daily (or more often, if possible). Put your shoes in the window and let
the sunlight get into them somewhat. Cut raw garlic into tiny pieces and put some into
your shoes. Dust your feet with garlic powder. Garlic is better than antifungal drugs!
• Try to keep your feet cool and dry. You may be able to think of ways to do this. Try to
find shoes that will not make your feet sweat. Avoid rubber shoes, even the expensive
ones.
• Fungi hates sunlight. When in the acute stage, try to leave your feet uncovered. Put your
feet in the sunlight every so often.
• Do not walk barefoot around the house, so others will not become infected. Also, never
walk barefoot in public places (public showers, locker rooms, pool decks); wear shoes or
slippers.
• Apply natural antifungicides, such as pau d'arco and tea tree oil.
• Drink 3 cups of pau d'arco tea daily. Also put a strong mixture of it on your feet.
• Apply lemon juice 1-2 times a day to the area, and let it dry. Another method is to apply
a strong tea of crushed juniper berries. Mash garlic with some oil and apply to the area.
• Add 20 drops of tea tree oil to a small tub of water, and soak your feet in it for 15
minutes, 3 times a day. Dry well afterward, and place some undiluted tea tree oil on the
feet.
• Apply a baking soda paste to the area, and especially between the toes. Mix 1 tbsp.
baking soda with a little warm water, apply, then dry well, and dust feet with cornstarch
powder.
• Applying overly strong applications to athlete's foot can result in rashes breaking out on
hands and elsewhere. If you have unknowingly done this: Treat the feet more gently and,
as the foot infection clears, the sympathetic rashes will also.
• Bathe the feet daily in 50-50 vinegar and water. Dry well, then apply a vegetable oil to
the affected area.
• Soak your foot in a mixture of 2 tsp. of salt per pint of warm water, for 5-10 minutes; dry
well and repeat till the problem is solved.
• Eat a nourishing diet, and skip the processed and junk foods. Obtain vitamins A, B
complex, and C.
• In case there is pain, place cold compresses on the area.
• If the problem worsens, and pus or a fever develops, see a professional.
• To help keep your feet dry, change your socks 3-4 times a day. After washing them,
rinse the socks well, to get out the detergent (which the fungus likes).
• Put on clean socks before dressing; in this way you avoid infecting the groin area.
• Boil socks to kill the fungus.
• Do not use plastic or waterproof shoes. They create a warm, moist place for fungus to
breed. Never wear boots all day.
• Do not wear the same shoes 2 days in a row. This gives a pair of shoes 2 days to
thoroughly dry out.
• Spray Lysol on a cloth and wipe the inside of the shoe.
• Place the shoes in the sunlight, angled toward the sun. Ultraviolet light kills fungus.
• Useful herbs are blood root and goldenseal; use alone or together. Apply as a powder to
the area.
• Crush a green plant juice, such as chickweed, plantain, Swiss chard, etc., and apply the
juice to the area. Then walk about barefooted in the sun.
—Also see ""Ringworm,"" which is a closely related fungal skin disease.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When we receive Christ as an abiding guest in the soul, the peace of God,
which passeth all understanding, keeps our hearts and minds through faith in Christ.
Section 4
Head and Throat
Part 1
Head

(Tinea Pedis)
SYMPTOMS—On the skin of the feet, especially between the toes, there are blisters or cracks, or both.
Also there is itching; burning; and, in extreme cases, pustules; and ulcers. As it develops, the blisters and/
or cracks soften, turn white, and tend to peel off in flakes. In severe cases, there may be pain. It is worse
in warmer weather.
CAUSES—Athlete's foot is caused by one or more of the parasitic fungi. Fungus infections are more
difficult to eliminate. Any condition which keeps the feet both warm and moist can lead to this problem.
By scratching the sores on the foot, the disease can be spread on the hands, under the nails, and to other
parts of the body.
The fungus, causing athlete's foot, spreads rapidly when beneficial bacteria are destroyed by antibiotics,
drugs, or radiation.
The organisms causing it are spread from contaminated floors surrounding pools, showers, and other
public places."
disease-general-dandruff,Dandruff,"TREATMENT
• Often there are severe B complex deficiencies, a lack of essential unsaturated fatty acids,
and zinc.
• Cut out excess fats, grease, and all fried foods from the diet. Stop the use of alcohol.
Check to see if you have food allergies (wheat, dairy products, citrus, or something else).
Avoid stress and poor elimination. Do not use strong, irritant shampoos or hair treatments.
Avoid chocolate, sugar, white flour, and seafood.
• To help control appearance, cleanse with a shampoo, designed to help control dandruff.
Wash the hair in vinegar, to remove all the loose scales.
• Be sure the diet includes flaxseed oil, vitamins E and A, PABA, Folic acid, B , and zinc.
6
If needed, take digestive enzymes. Also helpful are kelp, biotin, and lecithin. Eat 50-75%
raw food.
• A short fast is a good way to begin the program. Then begin eating only nutritious foods.
• Anti-microbial shampoos are often recommended, but there is no evidence that this germ-
killing factor lessens the dandruff.
• Get a detergent, such as Shaklee Basic H or Amway LOC (but not their corresponding
shampoos). Dilute (1 tbsp. to 1 cup water), and shampoo twice a week with it. This
frequently helps.
• Shampoos containing selenium sulfide can cause eye damage and hair loss.
• Plain water alone is also good.
• Pour warmed vinegar over the head, wrap in a towel, and wash off 30 minutes later.
• Do not put tar-based shampoos on your head if you have blonde hair; it will turn the hair
brown.
• A little sunlight is good for your scalp and hair.
• Keep calm and relaxed. It will help your hair.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The peace of Christ is constant and enduring. We can find no rest apart from
Him. Come, now, and make Him your own by faith.

SYMPTOMS—The greatest number of sebaceous (oil) glands are found on the face and scalp. Sebum,
the oily secretion, lubricates the hair and scalp in order to keep both soft and pliable. Excess sebum may
collect to form dandruff.
Dandruff is a covering of dead skin that prevents new hair from growing, because it cannot break
through the dead skin. A scaling or flaking of scalp cells results. It may or may not be accompanied by
itching.
CAUSES—A change in the surface cells of the scalp results in a scaling or flaking. This change is
especially keyed to nutritional deficiencies. It often occurs in those with oily skin who are prone to
develop superficial, acute, and chronic bacterial skin conditions.
There is generally excess secretion of oil by the sebaceous glands. It is this oil which binds the cells
together on the scalp. Nutritional deficiencies can cause these abnormal secretions."
disease-general-oily-hair,Oily Hair,"TREATMENT
• Many of the nutritional suggestions in ""Dandruff"" should be considered (which see).
• Only use clear shampoos; they have less oils in them.
• Give yourself a double shampoo, with a rinse in between. After shampooing, feel your
hair; does it feel oily? This will help you know how well you are doing.
• Squeeze the juice of two lemons into a pint of water and use it as a finishing rinse. This
helps remove soap residues which tend to weigh down the hair. Or use an apple cider
vinegar rinse.
• Do not overbrush, for this carries additional oil from the roots into the hair.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When you have asked for the things your soul needs, believe that God will
give you the best, just what you need. It may not come in exactly the way you expected, but it will be
just what is best.

SYMPTOMS—Excess amounts of oil in the hair. Redheads rarely have oily hair, blondes tend to have
it the most often.
CAUSES—The sebaceous glands produce too much oil, and there are nutritional aspects which need to
be corrected. There are as many as 140,000 oil glands on the scalp. Oil wicks into fine, straight hair the
easiest. Wiry hair tends to be the least oily.
Oil production tends to be increased by intense heat and humidity. Hormonal changes and stress can also
affect it."
disease-general-dry-hair,Dry Hair,"TREATMENT
• Include enough unsaturated fatty acids in your diet (unheated vegetables oils, such as
wheat germ, flaxseed, sesame, corn, or soy oil). See suggestions under ""Dry Skin.""
• Do not use heat to arrange your hair. Both curling irons and electric curlers produce heat
that is too intense. Instead, women should use unheated plastic cylinder rollers.
• Dry hair tends to produce frayed ends. Snip them off about every 6 weeks or so.
• Avoid whipping winds; they also tend to fray your hair. Women do best not to swim
bareheaded; use a bathing cap. It will protect the hair. For additional protection, rub on a
little olive oil before putting on the cap.
• Shampoo with care, using only mild shampoos.
• Avoid washing the hair every night.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Accept His gifts with the whole heart; for Jesus died that you might have the
precious things of heaven as your own, and at last find a home with the heavenly angels in the kingdom
of God.

SYMPTOMS—Hair that is dry enough that it bothers you.
CAUSES—A dry garden needs water; dry hair does not need water, but it needs natural oils."
disease-general-gray-hair,Gray Hair,"TREATMENT
• To restore natural color to gray hair, the following vitamins have been reported to be
successful for some people: PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid), pantothenic acid, folic acid,
along with brewer's yeast, and blackstrap molasses. Also take a good multi-vitamin/
mineral formula. Include some kelp or dulse in your diet.
ENCOURAGEMENT—While self is unsubdued, we can find no rest. But if you will find time and
voice to pray, God will find time and voice to answer.

SYMPTOMS—The hair is changing from its youthful color to a gray color.
CAUSES—A lack of three B complex vitamins is specific to this problem."
disease-general-ingrown-hair,Ingrown Hair,"TREATMENT
• The only practical solution is to pull it out with tweezers. Do not pull at just anything;
wait until you can actually see the hair. If necessary, place a warm compress on the area,
for a time, to help it be seen better. Then use tweezers or a sterilized needle, followed by a
dab of hydrogen peroxide on the area.
• People who find this too much of a problem might consider growing a beard. Once
established, that generally solves the problem. If beards are frowned on at your work, have
your physician write a note that it is a medical necessity for you to have one.
• Using an electric shaver is better than razors, because razors do not shave quite as close.
Razors also sharpen the hair end more, especially double track razors. If you do use a
razor, try not to shave as close.
• If your neck hairs are grown in different directions, train them to grow in only two
directions, by only shaving up and down, and not crossways.
• Women should shave their legs down, not up. Shaving upward is far more likely to cause
inward-growing hairs. This is because leg hairs grow downward.
ENCOURAGEMENT—However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus will find deliverance. His
providence will provide for their needs, and His grace will give power to resist temptation and sin.
Section 4
Head and Throat
Part 3
Eyes

SYMPTOMS—A hair, generally on the neck, grows down into the skin and causes irritation.
CAUSES—These tend to be caused by hairs which curl. Curly haired people are the most likely to have
this problem."
disease-general-farsightedness,Farsightedness,"TREATMENT
• Maintain a nourishing diet which includes a vitamin/mineral supplement. Be sure you
are daily obtaining the entire B complex, especially B . Calcium is also important.
6
• Do not try to strain the eyes. If they seem tired or unable to focus properly, rest them
from time to time. Straining the eyes to see better only aggravates the problem.
— Also read ""Eyestrain.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Heaven is not closed against the fervent prayers of God's little ones. The only
reason for our lack of power with God is to be found in ourselves. Too many only offer a little hurried
prayer, and then rush off. Take time with God! You urgently need it.

(Hyperopia)
SYMPTOMS—A person's distance vision is good, but his near vision is blurry.
CAUSES—The six muscles pulling on the eye do not function properly or the eyeball is abnormally
short. As a result, light rays focus behind the back wall of the eyeball, which is the retina."
disease-general-amblyopia,Amblyopia,"TREATMENT
• Lack of vitamins B and B appears to be a primary cause. Smoke from cigarettes and
1 12
cigars is another significant cause. These problems need to be solved.
• B intermuscularly at a rate of 1,000 mcg/day for a total of 20,000 mcg generally solves
12
the problem, along with an adequate supply of vitamin D and calcium. But get the tobacco
out of the house and office.
— Also read ""Eyestrain.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God that He is so near to help in time of need. Prayer and faith can do
that which no earthly power can accomplish. Trust Him and obey His Written Word, and you will have
the guidance you need.

(Inability to focus eyes)
SYMPTOMS—This condition exists when the eyes do not seem to focus clearly on anything, near or
far. It can be serious enough to constitute a type of blindness.
CAUSES—Certain nutritional and environmental problems tend to be the causes."
disease-general-keratomalacia,Keratomalacia,"TREATMENT
• Take vitamin A (25,000 units for children, and at least 50,000 units for adults) per day as
beta carotene. Increase the amount of zinc and protein consumption, and improve the
general nutrition. Take a vitamin/mineral supplement twice daily.
• Bitot's spots are caused by a vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin D and adequate protein are
also needed.
• Avoid eyestrain and smoke-filled rooms.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the spiritual life.
Take time with God, and you will be blessed for it. He can give you strength to live a better life, a clean
life, a new life in Christ.

(Xerophthalmia)
SYMPTOMS—The cornea is the domed clear bulge on the front of the eye. It becomes hazy and dry,
and then ulcerated. The eyes feel extremely dry. Blinking increases, but does not seem to properly
moisten them. Conjunctivitis and night blindness occurs.
Fat-like spots (Bitot's spots) appear on the sclera (white of the eye). These are white, foamy, elevated,
and sharply outlined patches on the whites of the eyes.
CAUSES—This is a nutritional problem. If it is not solved, permanent blindness can result."
disease-general-color-blindness,Color Blindness,"SYMPTOMS—It is difficult to distinguish one color from another.
CAUSE AND TREATMENT—
• Take 50,000 units of vitamin A daily.
ENCOURAGEMENT—There are perils all about us. We must draw nearer to God. Cultivate the habit
of talking with the Saviour. Let your heart be continually uplifted to Him, in silent petition for help, for
strength to obey, and for guidance. Let every breath be a prayer."
disease-general-night-blindness,Night Blindness,"TREATMENT
• Get enough vitamin A (50,000 units daily) and 15-50 mg of zinc.
• Some people wear a stronger prescription of glasses when they must drive at night. Keep
the headlights and windshield clean. Do not wear sunglasses at dusk. Drive slower at
night. Better yet, only drive during the day.
ENCOURAGEMENT—By keeping our minds on God and Bible themes, our faith and love will grow
stronger. We will have a little heaven on earth. And those around us need our help so much.

SYMPTOMS—You do not see as clearly in the dark as do others. When you go out into the dark, your
eyes seem to adapt slowly to it.
CAUSES—This does not mean you are going blind. The primary problem is a lack of vitamin A, which
the body uses to make visual purple and to help you see in the dark.
The lack of vitamin A in the system can be caused by an inferior diet. But it may also be traced to one of
the following: The body has a fat malabsorption syndrome, and does not absorb oil-soluble vitamins
properly. A zinc deficiency will cause the liver to poorly convert carotene to vitamin A. Cystic fibrosis,
celiac disease, and various food allergies can produce intestinal changes which would affect fat-soluble
vitamin absorption."
disease-general-cataracts,Cataracts,"TREATMENT
• Cataracts are the most common form of blindness in older people, and should not be
ignored when beginning to develop.
• Obtain adequate rest at night. Do not sit up watching television till late at night! You are
tiring your eyes and irradiating them with X rays at the same time.
• Maintain a good nutritious diet! Do not drink milk or eat cheese, ice cream, seafood, or
grease. Get enough vitamins E, C, B complex (B is very important!), selenium, zinc,
2
bioflavonoids, 1-glutamine, 1-arginine, 1-cysteine, and glutathione. If diabetes is
involved, add chromium supplementation. Avoid excess cholesterol, sorbitol (artificial
sweetener), unsaturated fatty acids, and mercury tooth fillings (amalgam).
• Higher blood sugar levels in diabetics and hypoglycemics causes the cells in the lense to
absorb large amounts of glucose. This is converted into sorbitol, an insoluble form of
sugar. This gradually crystallizes in the eye—forming a cataract.
• Take chaparral tea internally. Place a drop of honey in the corner of the eye at night.
This will help absorb the crystals.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not say that you cannot overcome your moral defects. In the strength of
Christ, you can. He will empower you to do all that His Father asks of you. The impossibility is all in
your will. If you will not, then you cannot. If you are willing, God will strengthen you to resist
temptation.

SYMPTOMS—The lens of the eye becomes clouded, so that the eye is unable to properly focus on
objects. In advanced cases, the lens is becoming opaque, so that blindness is setting in. Only part of the
eye is generally cloudy or opaque, but this can gradually extend to the entire eye.
CAUSES—The most common cause is senility.
Congenital cataracts occur if the mother had rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, or if the
infant has galactosemia (inherited inability to digest galactose [a type of milk sugar, resulting from
lactose] properly). These cataracts generally do not get worse. Not using milk products at all can help
prevent this in adults.
Traumatic cataracts result from blows which rupture the anterior lens capsule, harmful chemicals,
intense infrared radiation, or X rays. Radiation causes free radical damage in the eyes. This causes the
lens to absorb aqueous humor. The lens becomes cloudy and must be removed, to restore eyesight.
People living closer to the South Pole (which has part of its ozone layer stripped away) are more likely
to develop cataracts.
Other causes include hypoparathyroidism, Down's syndrome, and atopic dermatitis. The longer one has
diabetes, the greater the risk of cataracts.
Hair dye has been shown to cause cataracts. Only 23% of those not dying their hair get cataracts;
whereas 89% of those who dye their hair develop them.
Complications of tumors, detached retina, iritis, glaucoma, and severe myopia can also bring it on.
Other studies reveal that people with stress, allergies, or who eat seafood (thus ingesting methylmercury)
are more likely to develop cataracts.
It is now known that a reduction in vitamin C or B in the diet can help produce cataracts. High blood
2
sugar levels and low calcium levels can also bring it on."
disease-general-sty,Sty,"TREATMENT
• Do not delay solving this problem. If it does not quickly heal, it may need to be drained
by a professional. Do not squeeze the lump; this may result in spreading the infection
more widely. Sties can be dangerous, so do not be casual about them.
• Take adequate vitamin A; more so, if you have sties frequently. Go on a 5-day fruit fast,
plus carrot and celery juice. Keep the bowels clean with an enema every morning.
• Do not eat refined, fried, and processed foods; meats; unsaturated oils; salt; alcohol;
tobacco; dairy products; or white flour.
• Chopped and diced carrots or mashed potatoes (raw or cooked) can be made into a
poultice and applied over the area. They can be left on for an hour and repeated 3 times a
day.
• Hot compresses on the area are sometimes recommended; but keep in mind that it was a
very hot compress which blinded young Fanny Crosby.
• Partially hot compress, alternated with cold, will help draw the pus to a head and then
break it open.
• Drink 3 cups of goldenseal tea or eyebright to help clean the liver. Fennel or myrrh may
be substituted.
• In tenacious cases, antibiotics may be necessary.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Bible reveals the plan of salvation, and shows how sinful man may be
reconciled to God and enabled to live a clean, godly life.

SYMPTOMS—What appears to be a small pimple develops on the eyelid.
CAUSES—The oil gland has become infected, inflaming the tissues of the eyelid."
disease-general-scotoma,Scotoma,"TREATMENT
• Increase the amount of vitamin A in the diet; and, of course, decidedly improve the
general diet. Throw out all junk and processed food. Obtain adequate rest at night.
ENCOURAGEMENT—You cannot control your impulses, your emotions, as you may desire; but, in
the strength of Christ, you can control the will, and you can make an entire change in your life.

SYMPTOMS—The person seems to see ""spots"" or a spot in front of the eyes.
CAUSES—An unnatural blind spot exists on the retina."
disease-general-photophobia,Photophobia,"TREATMENT
• Take 50,000 units of vitamin A daily for a short time.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All who have a sense of their deep soul poverty, who feel that they have
nothing good in themselves, may find peace and strength by looking to Jesus. Thank God, that He not
only accepts us, but He changes us.

SYMPTOMS—Light hurts the eyes.
CAUSES—This may occur occasionally or gradually increase. The cause is a lack of vitamin A in the
diet."
disease-general-chalazion,Chalazion,"TREATMENT
• Take vitamin A (at least 50,000 units per day, as beta carotene, for a number of days.
Also take zinc (50 mg, 3 times a day).
• Apply warm poultices of 3% boric acid on the closed lid. A boric acid ophthalmic
ointment may be obtained without prescription from the pharmacy.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When God gave His Son to our world, He endowed human beings with
imperishable riches—with which nothing else can compare. Christ offers you all the love of God. Come,
accept it just now.

SYMPTOMS—This appears to be a sty on the eyelid, but it is not. After several days, the swelling and
pain disappears, but a slow growing pea-sized nodule on the lid remains.
CAUSES—A chalazion is the result of plugged meibomian glands in the eyelid, and results from
nutritional deficiency."
disease-general-conjunctivitis,Conjunctivitis,"TREATMENT
• Apply warm poultices of 3% boric acid on the closed lid. A boric acid ophthalmic
ointment may be obtained without prescription from the pharmacy.
• Apply charcoal poultices overnight. Mix enough water in, to make a thick paste and
spread it over a piece of cloth that is larger than the inflamed area. Hold it in place with an
ace bandage and leave on overnight. Use only enough pressure to hold it in place—but not
so tight that pressure is placed on the eyeball. To avoid spreading the infection, carefully
dispose of the cloth in the morning; do not save and use it again.
• During the day, slurry charcoal water can be applied: Add ¼ tsp. salt and 1 tsp.
powdered charcoal to a cup of water, boil, let cool, and strain through several layers of
cloth.
• With a dropper, put 4-5 drops of the clear fluid on the affected eye every 2 hours.
• Wash hands carefully after each treatment.
• Do not place a patch on the eye, for it can cause bacterial infection and weaken the
eyelid (so it will later droop).
• Ice-cold compresses can be laid on the eye during the acute stage. For half an hour,
apply a wrung-out washcloth to the eye; change it every 2-3 minutes. Stop for 30-60
minutes, and then repeat for another 30 minutes.
• Hot and cold applications can be applied every 4 hours. But the water should never be
too hot (that is what blinded young Fanny Crosby). Apply a cloth wrung out of slightly
hot water for 2 minutes, then a cold cloth for 30 seconds. Do this for 15 minutes.
• Saline irrigations are also good. Add 2 level tsp. of salt to 1 quart water, to rinse
discharges out of the eyes.
PREVENTION—
• Avoid the problems noted under ""Causes,"" above.
• When something gets in your eye; get it out. Grasping the eyelash and pulling the upper
lid over the lower lid, induces tears and helps wash out foreign bodies.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The heart of him who receives the grace of God overflows with love for God
and for those whom Christ died. He becomes kind and thoughtful, humble, yet full of hope and
encouragement to those around him.

(Pinkeye)
SYMPTOMS—The membrane lining of the inner part of the eyelid becomes inflamed. The eyes may
appear swollen and bloodshot, and are often irritated and itchy. If there is pus, eyelids often stick
together after being closed for a period of time.
CAUSES—There may be a discharge from the eye. The origin may be viral if the discharge is thin and
watery. If it is white and stringy, the cause may be allergenic. If there is pus, it may be bacterial in
origin.
When caused by a virus, conjunctivitis is highly contagious. The cause is generally viral or bacterial
infection or physical or chemical injury.
Causes include injury to the eye, bacterial infection, allergens, dust, contact lens solutions, fumes,
smoke, chemicals, makeup, or other foreign substances in the eye. Be careful about swimming pool
water; it can cause eye and ear infections.
When caused by allergens, the infection may reoccur at a certain time each year. In young children ""viral
conjunctivitis"" can occur from spring till fall.
Viral conjunctivitis is often found among groups of school children. Conjunctivitis is the most common
form of eye infection in Western civilization."
disease-general-glaucoma,Glaucoma,"TREATMENT
• There appears to be no evidence that restoration of vision, lost through glaucoma-caused
nerve degeneration, can be restored. But there are things which can be done to slow or
stop the advance of this problem.
• Dietetic problems are among the most common causes of glaucoma. This includes
overeating, eating the wrong foods, and not eating the right ones. Emphasize a raw,
vitamin C rich, diet.
• Food ""allergies,"" eating foods which do not agree with the system, can be a frequent
cause of the disease. Do a pulse test and find out which foods may be causing you
problems. In addition, a tonometer can be purchased, which you can use to test your
eyeball pressure.
• The diet should include betaine HCl, vitamin C, a good vitamin/mineral supplement,
vitamin A, vitamin B , and nourishing, natural food—but not too much of it.
2
• Moderate, daily out-of-door, exercise helps reduce pressure.
• Warm fennel herb, alternated with chamomile and eyebright, is helpful. Apply as
eyewash in an eyecup or three drops to each eye, 3 times a day.
• If anxiety seems to be a cause, increase the B complex intake. Avoid stress, worry, fear,
and anger. Cultivate a tranquil, restful lifestyle. Great temperature changes (as found in
the north) are a source of stress.
• Higher blood sugar levels increase pressure.
• Avoid heavy lifting, pulling, etc. Avoid constipation, for straining at the stool increases
eye pressure (as does diarrhea). Maintain a slight, mild laxative effect. Avoid sitting or
standing still for long periods. Lying face down significantly increases pressure. Standing
on the hands astoundingly increases pressure.
• Increased blood pressure brings increased pressure within the eyeball. Keep your blood
pressure down!
• Do not use the eyes intensively for long periods of time (TV viewing or excessive
reading).
• Avoid coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, and all junk and processed foods. Smoking damages
eyes which have glaucoma. Tobacco in the system increases intraocular pressure. Avoid
spicy foods.
• Avoid excessive fluid intake (juice, water, milk, etc.) at any one time. Drink only small
amounts, and only an hour apart.
• Motion sickness medication patches increase eyeball pressure.
• Those with glaucoma do well to remain under the care of a professional. Every time the
pressure increases, a little more eyesight is permanently lost.
ENCOURAGEMENT—No difficulty can hinder you, if you are determined to seek first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness. Looking to Jesus, you will be willing to brave contempt and derision for
His sake.
Section 4
Head and Throat
Part 4
Smell and Taste

SYMPTOMS—Early symptoms include eye pain or discomfort mainly in the morning, blurred vision,
halos around light, inability to adjust to darker conditions, and peripheral (side) vision loss (resulting in
tunnel vision).
Higher than normal pressure within the eyeball (called intraocular pressure), it is more common in
blacks than whites, tends to run in families, is more common in women than men, and especially affects
people over 40.
CAUSES—Fluid is continually produced in the eyeball; and, just as continuously, it is draining out. The
balance is called intraocular pressure. Normal pressure is 15-20 millimeters of mercury, but glaucoma
levels may reach 40 or more. The increased pressure, unless it is relieved, will damage the optic nerve
and produce blindness. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness. There are several types of
glaucoma."
disease-general-anosmia,Anosmia,"TREATMENT
• Take 30-60—generally 50 mg—of zinc, 3 times a day.
ENCOURAGEMENT—What love, what amazing love! That the King of glory would humble Himself
to save fallen humanity! Come, fall before Him just now, and give Him your life anew.
NASAL CATARRH—1
(Rhinitis; Runny, stuffy nose)
SYMPTOMS—Rhinitis is the inflammation of the nasal passages, producing nasal congestion and
increased secretion of mucous. The nose is runny or stuffed up. When a person drinks enough water, the
nose is runny; when not enough has been taken, the nose is stuffed and one has to breathe through the
mouth.
CAUSES—This condition accompanies a variety of problems, including the common cold.
• Obtain adequate rest, an adequate fluid intake, and a well-balanced diet. Increase the
amount of vitamin A, as well as the other vitamins.
• Eucalyptus oil is an old-fashioned treatment, long in use. Other helps include German
chamomile, scotch pine, and cayenne pepper.
• An important aspect is not to blow hard—and unintentionally force phlegm up the
eustachian tubes. This can lead to ear infection.
• Beware of decongestants; they can hurt the nasal lining.
—Also see ""Nasal Catarrh—2,"" ""Common Cold,"" and ""Catarrh 1.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—By yielding your will to Christ, He will hold you fast. You will have strength
and determination to live a clean life, and resist temptation to sin.
NASAL CATARRH—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
(1) ACUTE Catarrh (Acute Coryza) —
GENERAL TREATMENT—Sweating bath at bedtime, followed by a short cold application: Wet
Sheet Rub; Cold Towel Rub; Cold Douche; Hot Foot Bath, with very hot compress to the face; Steam
Inhalation; and water drinking.
TO PREVENT—Cold Bath daily or twice a day; out-of- door life; avoid excessively warm clothing and
warm living, or warm sleeping rooms, in the winter. Wear linen next to the skin in summer and winter.
(2) CHRONIC CATARRH —
BASIC CONSIDERATIONS—Avoid taking cold. And when an acute catarrh is contracted, eliminate
it as soon as possible.
INCREASE ACTIVITY AND TONE OF THE SKIN—Short sweating procedures, especially the
Radiant Heat Bath and Wet Sheet Pack continued until the sweating stage, followed by short cold
applications: Wet Sheet Rub; Shallow Bath or Cold Douche; Neutral Bath at bedtime, 20-30 minutes, 3
times a week; daily Cold morning Bath; Cold Towel Rub; Cold Shower or Shallow rubbing Bath. All
sweating baths ought, if possible, to be taken just before retiring at night.
IMPROVE NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE—Avoid indigestible, spicy, foods and meats. Eat simply
of wholesome food. Obtain needed out-of-door exercise, sunbaths, and swimming.
RELIEVE NASAL CONGESTION—Alternate Compress to the face; Alternate Sponging or
Compresses to the upper spine; Cold Foot Bath under running water if the extremities are cold.
GENERAL METHOD—Build up the general health by tonic measures, employing Friction Tonics, at
least twice daily. Avoid Hot Baths and too warm clothing. Expose the body, as much as possible, to the
open air, but use great care to avoid taking cold by undue exposures; gradually train the body to the
point of enduring exposure without injury. (Drink enough water to keep the mucous in the nose thin, so
it can easily flow out without clogging the passageways. Do not blow your nose, lest mastoid infection
occurs).
—See ""Nasal Catarrh—1.""

(Loss of sense of smell)
SYMPTOMS—One does not detect odors. This can occur either temporarily or regularly.
CAUSES—This occurs when one has a cold or rhinitis (nasal inflammation, resulting from colds or
allergy).
But when it is chronic, then it has one of several causes: a lack of zinc in the diet, an injury, a tumor, or a
stroke. Zinc will not help in those cases."
disease-general-nasal-cuts-and-infections,Nasal Cuts And Infections,"SYMPTOMS—Efforts to pick at the inside of the nose, to clean it out, will occasionally result in cuts
inside which sometimes become mildly infected for a time.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• It is easy to get into a habit of picking at the nose, even when there is no reason to do so.
People sometimes feel driven to pick at the nose, imagining they will somehow make it
super clean.
• But unwashed fingers in the nose can result in cuts which infect for a day or two.
(Infection from contaminated hands is even more likely if you have a dog or cat in the
house.)
• The solution is simple enough: Routinely wash your nose out with water in the bathroom
every morning. This only takes a few seconds, but it will remove the sometimes sticky
mucous in there. The urge to afterward pick at the nose will be lessened.
• Teach yourself, whenever possible, to leave your nose alone.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All around us, souls are hungering for Christ and a knowledge of how to be
saved. Do all you can to be a help to them. They need you to help lead them to God. In His strength, you
can do it.

disease-general-meniere-s-syndrome,Meniere'S Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• A general cleansing routine is often met with excellent results. This would include
fasting for 3-7 days on vegetable juices, which would be repeated every six weeks. In
between, a solid nutritious diet, composed of lots of vegetables, seaweed, seeds, nuts,
beans, etc., should be eaten.
• Vitamins A, B complex (including B , niacin, pantothenic acid), and especially vitamin
6
C. Calcium is also needed. A lack of manganese can cause deafness, dizziness, and ear
noises. A lack of magnesium can produce nerve twitching and sensitivity to noise.
• Drink enough water.
• Eliminate white flour products, white sugar, unsaturated fats, excess salt intake, caffeine,
nicotine, and alcohol. An oil free diet may improve circulation in the tiny capillaries.
Smoking induces constriction and spasm of the blood vessels. In one study, 9 out of 10
patients improved, when placed on a low-salt diet.
• In another study, allergies to milk, eggs, corn, wheat, and yeast sometimes caused
Meniere's. Eliminating them essentially terminated the problem. Stop using all of the
above foods; then gradually reintroduce one at a time, and see which might be bothering
you.
• Variations in glucose levels can prompt Meniere's. A New York study indicated that,
when insulin levels are normal, the patient seldom has tinnitus, vertigo, fullness in the ear,
or variable hearing loss.
• Gradually increase the amount of out-of-door exercise. Breath deeply as you do it. This
will help the circulation in the head.
• Use one bowl for hot water and one for cold, once or twice a day, and take a hot and cold
head bath. Immerse the head in the hot, for 30-60 seconds, and then plunge it into ice cold.
(If elderly, weakened, or with a heart condition, begin with less extreme temperatures.)
• Herbs which may help include cayenne, gotu kola, butcher's broom, ginkgo biloba, and
ginger.
• At the time of an attack, lying quietly on the affected side, with eyes turned in the
direction of the affected ear may help reduce the immediate crisis.
• If helping someone with this problem, let him move about at his own rate. Avoid jarring
him. When speaking to him, stand directly in front so he will not have to turn his head
(which can add to the vertigo).
—Also see ""Vertigo,"" and ""Tinnitus.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not try to manage your own life. You cannot do it as well as God can do it
for you. Work with Him. Surrender your plans to Him, to be laid down or taken up as He sees best.

SYMPTOMS—A disease of the inner ear, characterized by recurring episodes of ringing in the ears
(tinnitus), loss of balance, and severe dizziness (vertigo). There is progressive deafness and a sensation
of fullness in the ears. Sudden movement during an attack can induce nausea and vomiting. Sometimes
there is an uncontrollable horizontal jerking of the eyeballs.
The condition may affect one or both ears. It generally occurs in adults (most often in women, 50-60
years old). The onset is sudden. It may last for hours or weeks, and then return soon again, after years. In
most instances, it is experienced only in one ear, and can result in complete deafness in that ear.
Vertigo is the sensation that the world is turning around you. Meniere's syndrome accounts for 10-15%
of all vertigo (and 5% of all dizziness).
(Also see ""Vertigo."")
CAUSES—This often results from a metabolic problem, resulting from a disturbed carbohydrate
metabolism, such as is found in hypoglycemia.
Impaired blood flow to the brain may be a causative factor. Those experiencing Meniere's syndrome
often have a history of vasomotor rhinitis, ear trouble, and allergies.
Autopsies reveal an edema in the membranous labyrinth.
Other possible causes may include allergies, viruses, infections, and hormonal intolerances.
Symptoms exactly like Meniere's syndrome can be caused by a cholesteatoma. This is a tumor-like
growth in the middle ear, which gradually pushes on the central nervous system. Consulting with a
specialist might be of help in diagnosing the cause.
In some instances this is misdiagnosed; and it is actually salicylism, from excessive self-medication of
aspirin. That can also cause deafness, ringing in the ears, dizziness, headache, vomiting, confusion, and
hyperventilation in the later stages. If that is the cause, stop all taking of aspirin immediately.
Fluid retention in the semicircular canals might be putting pressure on the delicate nerves of the inner
ear."
disease-general-tinnitus,Tinnitus,"TREATMENT
• Surgical success rates are very low. Beware of ""tinnitus maskers."" These products can
cause hearing loss.
• Do the pulse test to check on problem foods. Have a hair analysis made. Find the cause
and eliminate it. A 1981 medical study pointed to coffee, tea, tonic water, red wine, grain-
based spirits, chocolate, and cheese as the most common dietary causes of tinnitus.
• Mix 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. glycerin in 1 pint warm water. Several times a day, using a
nasal sprayer, spray each nostril until it begins draining into the back of the throat; also
spray the throat.
• Get a nourishing diet, and include trace minerals (Norwegian kelp or Nova Scotia dulse),
vitamin A, calcium, magnesium, and betaine HCl.
• A lack of manganese can cause deafness, dizziness, and ear noises. A lack of magnesium
can produce nerve twitching and sensitivity to noise.
• Changing and correcting the diet, reducing stress, and getting more exercise out-of-doors
has been helpful in dealing with tinnitus. Stress causes more adrenaline to be produced
which, in turn, constricts blood vessels and keeps waste products from being as quickly
eliminated.
• Remember that fatigue increases the problem. An important help is to go to bed and get
up on a regular, healthful, schedule.
• Avoid loud noises and noisy situations. Alcohol makes tinnitus worse. Caffeine is a
common cause. Marijuana and cocaine intensify the problem. Aspirin is a known cause of
tinnitus, also blood pressure and arthritis drugs. Also beware of steroids, anticonvulsive
medications, vasodilators, and anticholesterol drugs. Nicotine damages the hearing.
• Make sure the colon is working well. An enema will help with this.
• Worthwhile herbs would include bugleweed, garlic, gotu kola, cayenne, and prickly ash.
—Also see ""Meniere's Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ desires to give you the riches of eternal life with Him. What can
compare with that? Do not wait any longer. Come to Him right now. Kneel down alone and pray to Him
right now.
Section 4
Head and Throat
Part 6
Throat

SYMPTOMS—Sounds in the ear: ringing; whistling; roaring; hissing; chirping; buzzing; and whining
cricket sounds, when there is no outside physical source for these sounds. At first, they come and go; in
advanced stages, the sound is constant. No one else hears them.
There are reported instances in which others have heard the sounds from as much as 4 feet from the
person's ear. ""Tinnitus,"" in Latin, means ""to tinkle,"" or a ""bell-like ring.""
The frequency of tinnitus increases with age. The left ear seems to produce the sounds more often than
the right ear. About 75% of deaf people report tinnitus.
CAUSES—There are several possible causes, including an irritation of nerve endings in the ear by loud
noises. Chemicals and drugs can injure the internal ear. Prescription drugs can produce tinnitus or
hearing loss (beware of quinine and aspirin). Nicotine constricts blood vessels and may be the cause.
Other causes are lead; aluminum; mercury poisoning; impacted wax; hormonal problems; high blood
pressure; severe blows to the head; anemia; perforation of the tympanic membrane; fluid in the middle
ear; epilepsy; migraine; food allergy; Meniere's disease; hypothyroidism; multiple sclerosis; as well as
repeated and prolonged exposure to loud noises. Whatever the cause, stress sometimes adds to it.
Tinnitus is not a sign of a more serious problem or a precursor of any serious disease—unless it is
associated with Meniere's Disease (which see)."
disease-general-pharyngitis,Pharyngitis,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
(1) ACUTE FORM —
DIETARY FACTORS—Rest in bed, keep room at a uniform temperature. Eat a spare diet, consisting
chiefly of fruits. Avoid meats of all sorts. Copious water drinking.
GENERAL CARE—Hot Blanket Pack; sweating Wet Sheet Pack; Steam Bath; Radiant Heat Bath; Hot
Full Bath, followed by Dry Pack or other sweating procedures once daily, followed by Cold Mitten
Friction, Cold Wet Sheet Rub, or Cold Douche. Fomentation to the throat 3 times daily; Cold Compress
between, changed every 15-30 minutes. Enema, if bowels are inactive. Hot gargle every few minutes if
throat is very sensitive. Ice Bag to throat if inflammation is intense. Inhalation of soothing vapors; use of
steam inhaler for 10-14 minutes, hourly or almost continuously. If the tonsil suppurates (it oozes pus), it
should be lanced. See your doctor.
(2) CHRONIC FORM —
CLERGYMAN'S SORE THROAT DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE—Aseptic dietary; out-of-door
life; open-air gymnastics; swimming.
GENERAL CARE—Fomentations to the throat at bedtime, followed by throat pack (Cold Compress)
during the night; hot gargle, 3 times a day. Radiant Heat Bath; sweating Wet Sheet Pack; Steam Bath or
other sweating bath, 3 times weekly, followed by suitable cold application. Daily Cold Bath on rising.
Moist Abdominal Bandage to be worn during the night. If necessary, remove tonsils and vegetations in
throat or postnasal region."
disease-general-snoring,Snoring,"TREATMENT
• Sleep on your side; not on your back. One method which works fine is to sew a tennis
ball into the middle of the back of your pajamas. When you roll onto it in your sleep, you
will quickly roll off again—and there will be no snoring.
• Pillows tend to elevate your head and increase snoring.
• Put blocks under the front legs of your bed, and elevate the entire upper part of your
body. This will reduce snoring.
• Losing weight tends to lessen the snoring. The more overweight a person is, the more
likely he or she will snore.
• Alcoholic drinkers and smokers tend to snore more than other people. Sleeping pills also
increase it.
• Snoring can develop as a result of allergies, during or following hay fever time, or after
colds.
• Tell your spouse to shake you when you snore. That will wake you enough that you will
stop.
• Buy your spouse ear plugs to wear at night.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you will come to Jesus just as you are, weak, helpless, and despairing, He
will meet you a great way off, and will enable you to fully obey His Father's commandments.

SYMPTOMS—Wheezing, sighing noises made through the mouth while a person is sleeping. It drives
everyone else to distraction, except the one making the noise. The tissue in the upper airway in the back
of the throat relaxes during sleep, and breathing in causes it to vibrate.
CAUSES—Snoring generally occurs while sleeping on the back. The mouth falls open and the singing
begins.
Men snore much more often (71% of men) than women (51% of women). Most snorers are middle-aged,
overweight men."
disease-general-bruxism,Bruxism,"TREATMENT
• You may find that the solution is simply to stop chewing during the day when you do not
need to. Do not chew gum. Do not chew bits of food after the meal is ended. When you
are not eating to swallow food, do not chew. This simple rule has totally eliminated the
bruxism problem for many people. It can do it for you also.
If you will carefully think about it, you will find that chewing, as a leisure time activity, is
not relaxing; it actually makes one nervous. Once you fix the habit of unnecessarily
chewing during the day, it can easily be repeated at night.
• Throughout the day, keep your mouth relaxed. Do not clamp your teeth together; do not
grind. If you control yourself during the day, you will soon automatically be doing it at
night also.
• Hypoglycemia can be a factor. When a person has low blood sugar, he is more likely to
clench and grind his teeth.
• Some people find it necessary to wear a splint while sleeping.
• Do not drink alcoholic beverages. They contribute to tooth grinding.
—See ""Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome."" If bruxism is not eliminated, it can lead to TMJ, and you
do not want that to happen!
ENCOURAGEMENT—With the trusting faith of a little child, we can come to our heavenly Father,
and tell Him of all our needs. He will not turn us away, but will hear and help.

(Teeth Grinding)
SYMPTOMS—Unconscious grinding of the teeth together, often while asleep.
CAUSES—Bruxism can wear down the teeth, loosen them, and even contribute to receding gums; so it
is a condition you want to stop.
The experts tell us it is caused by stress, anxiety, anger, sensitivity of the teeth to heat and cold, and
fluctuations in blood sugar levels."
disease-general-calculus,Calculus,"TREATMENT
• Brush with fresh strawberries. Place a strawberry on the toothbrush and brush as usual.
• Brush with charcoal powder.
• Clean your teeth after every meal.
• Polish them with baking soda. Many of the stains are acid in nature, and the soda
neutralizes and removes them.
• Rinse the food from your mouth after each meal.
• An electric toothbrush removes more plaque than regular brushing.
• Keep in mind that hard brushing can scratch your tooth enamel. The super-whitening
tooth abrasives take off even more. Be careful. You want white teeth, but you also want
teeth.
• Since we are on the subject of ruining your teeth, an excellent way to melt your teeth is
to drink cola drinks. They contain phosphoric acid, which has a double whammy effect on
your poor teeth! The acid melts your alkaline teeth; and the phosphorous immediately
locks into the calcium melted off, and carries it away. Place a tooth in Coca Cola, and it
will be gone in a short time.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We need to come into the audience chamber of the Most High, and ask
forgiveness for our sins. He will hear, He will forgiven, and He will give us enabling strength to resist
sin. It all depends on our choice. But we must not waver in our loyalty to Him.

(Tartar; Stained Teeth)
SYMPTOMS—The teeth are darker and more yellow than they should be.
CAUSES—The actual color of teeth is not white, but light yellow. But, as one ages, his teeth tend to
become somewhat darker and more yellow.
Coffee and cigarettes are a primary cause of tooth staining. Stop using them both and you will look
much prettier. You will feel better too."
disease-general-gingivitis,Gingivitis,"TREATMENT
• Begin taking more calcium. Get more sunshine or take supplemental vitamin D. Building
the bones from within is the best way. If your teeth are having trouble, the other bones in
your body, although hidden, probably are also. You do not want a fractured hip later.
• Eat a nourishing diet. Include raw fruit and vegetables. They help exercise your teeth and
gums. They also help clean your teeth.
• Stop using nicotine and alcohol. They remove vitamins and minerals from your body.
• Fill an ear syringe (a rubber bulb with a long nose) with water and hose out your mouth.
Massage the gums at least once a day; better yet, massage after every meal when you
brush your teeth.
• Massage the gumline with a little baking soda on your finger, dipped in water.
• Brush the teeth carefully after each meal. Use a soft toothbrush and do it gently.
Otherwise you will make scratches on the enamel.
Alternate between two toothbrushes, so each one can dry out before it is used again.
• Soak the toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide once a week. This kills bacteria buildup.
• Brush carefully at the gumline.
• An electric toothbrush is said to eliminate 98% of the plaque; whereas a regular
toothbrush is said to remove only 48%.
• Floss your teeth faithfully as needed.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Thousands have drawn from the well of life, yet there is no diminishing
supply. In the Bible will be found the help you need, day by day.

(Receding Gums, Bleeding Gums)
SYMPTOMS—The gums swell and get red. Cleaning the teeth makes them bleed.
CAUSES—The gums pull away from the teeth. This is an early sign of periodontal disease (which see)."
disease-general-pyorrhea,Pyorrhea,"TREATMENT
• It is known that inadequate nutrition, wrong foods, consumption of sugar, high
phosphorous foods, smoking, drugs, excessive alcohol, chronic illness, and hormonal
disorders make an individual more susceptible to periodontal disease. Smokers have twice
the risk of gum disease. Laboratory animals given high sugar diets revealed a decrease in
bone volume. These problems should, if possible, be corrected.
• Calcium, copper, and vitamins D and C are needed for good strong teeth. Folic acid,
niacin, bioflavonoids are also needed. As a rule, take care of the teeth, and the gums will
take care of themselves. Nourish the teeth with calcium and vitamin D.
• Emotional stress is known to decrease the body's ability to resist gum disease. Exercise
neutralizes stress and encourages healthy gums.
• Open a capsule of vitamin E and rub the oil on inflamed gums, to aid in healing.
• A powerful aid in stopping gum infection is to brush the teeth twice a day with powdered
charcoal.
• If gum inflammation is present, run very hot water over the toothbrush, to soften it up
before using it.
• Put goldenseal powder in the mouth to help eliminate the infection. But do not take
goldenseal internally for more than a week at a time. (Too much can harm lactobacillus in
the bowel.) Do not use it during pregnancy.
• Diabetes and certain blood disorders put a person at greater risk of developing
periodontal disease.
• Warm chamomile tea may be used as a soothing mouthwash after each brushing. Do not
add sugar or milk to the tea.
Note: Sores under the tongue can be an early sign of mouth cancer. But if you do not smoke or chew
tobacco, you are unlikely to ever have that problem.
—Also see ""Gingivitis"" for the other half of this periodontal problem.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord is soon coming. Talk it, pray it, sing it. Tell others to get their lives
ready to meet their Lord. But it is now, before probation closes, that we must, by faith in Christ, put sin
away from our lives.

(Periodontal Disease, Gum Disease)
SYMPTOMS—The gums become inflamed, extend to the ligaments and bones that hold the teeth in
place, and eventually the teeth loosen and fall out.
CAUSES—Periodontal means ""located around a tooth,"" and refers to any problems in the gums or other
supporting structures of the teeth. It is also called pyorrhea, or gum disease. Gingivitis (which see) is
inflammation of the gums, an early stage of periodontal disease.
The explanation given by many medical-dental professionals for periodontal disease is that plaque
(sticky deposits of mucous, food particles, and bacteria) adheres to the teeth and gradually accumulates.
This plaque causes the gums to become infected and swollen. That infection (called gingivitis), leads to
pyorrhea (also called periodontitis) in which the bone underlying the teeth is eroded away by the
infection.
The other explanation is that much of what is known as pyorrhea is primarily caused by an inadequate
intake of calcium, copper, vitamins D and C; by the eating of processed, and junk, food; and by erosion
of acids, placed in the mouth. Smoking, stress, and wrong diet are other crucial factors."
disease-general-denture-troubles,Denture Troubles,"SYMPTOMS—Loose-fitting dentures; dentures which may hurt the gums when chewing; dentures
which cause difficulty in speaking properly.
CAUSES—Dentures are false teeth. The professional explanation for the problem is that the wearers do
not take proper care of them, and that the gums periodically change shape, etc.
There is another, less-known, reason: When the decision is made to extract teeth and fit an individual for
dentures, the teeth are pulled out and the molds prepared for the false teeth. The entire process is done as
quickly as possible, so teeth will appear to be in the mouth again as soon as possible. In addition, it is a
convenience to the dentist to take the molds the same day that the extractions were done.
But when the extractions are made, the gums understandably swell! A number of sizeable wounds have
been made in the mouth, and the gums are swollen and inflamed. That is not the time to take the molds.
Instead, the person should wait at least one week for the gums to heal and readjust into their normal post-
dental sizes and shapes. Then those molds should be made.
If your dentist tells you that you need all your teeth pulled out, discuss the matter with him and perhaps
check with another dentist or two. Very often only certain teeth need be removed and a bridge can be
installed, which locks onto the teeth which remain. This is far better than wearing dentures. Do all you
can to keep your teeth.
LIVING WITH DENTURES—
• Practice speaking. By yourself, read aloud from books and learn how to articulate
vowels, consonants, and various combinations.
• Temporary denture adhesives may be necessary when you are first getting used to your
new dentures. But you should not need to rely on adhesives all the time. The dentures
should fit properly. Do not let the dentist take molds too soon.
• When you can, take out the dentures so the gums can rest.
• Begin by eating soft foods, and gradually get used to chewing with dentures.
• After each meal, scrub the dentures with soap and lukewarm water. Wash your gums
gently with a soft toothbrush, to remove the plaque.
• Massage your gums every day. Place your index finger over the outside of the gums,
another finger over the inside portion, and rub back and forth.
• Rinse your mouth each day with warm water mixed with a tsp. of salt.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When the servants of Christ take the shield of faith for their defense, and the
sword of the Spirit for war, there is danger in the enemy's camp. Give your life fully to God, so He can
use it for His glory and the advancement of His kingdom.

Mouth"
disease-general-saliva-problems,Saliva Problems,"SYMPTOMS—Not enough saliva, causing a dry-mouth condition. Or too much saliva.
SOLUTIONS—
• Without proper saliva, you cannot absorb your food properly, for digestion begins in the
mouth. Always chew carbohydrate (""starchy"") foods especially well. This includes such
things as bread and all grain products, potatoes, etc.
• The chewing gum habit is not good. It overworks your salivary glands when they should
be resting.
• If you have a dry mouth, take a little lemon juice or honey before the meal to stimulate
the flow of saliva. If you are not obtaining enough vitamin A, your saliva flow may be
inadequate.
• If you seem to have too much saliva, drink a tea of one of the following: white oak bark,
goldenseal root, or bayberry.
—Important: You may have Sjogren's Syndrome (which see).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God every day for temporal blessings and whatever comforts He
bestows upon us in this life. He has a bright future for us; and, if we will but cooperate with His plans,
our future is very bright."
disease-general-halitosis,Halitosis,"TREATMENT
• Brush your teeth after each meal. Use dental floss.
• Brush the tongue carefully. It often has food particles and bacteria, and needs cleaning.
• Drink more water. Dehydration often causes bad breath, especially first thing in the
morning. Saliva does not flow during sleep, so no mouth cleaning occurs at night.
• Eat parsley. Other chlorophyll-containing foods are also good for your breath.
• Take charcoal by mouth. Let them dissolve slowly in the mouth.
• Go on a five-day raw food diet, during which 50% of what you eat is raw. This will help
clean out your system.
• Apples, carrots, celery, etc., are excellent for cleaning out your mouth at the close of a
meal. They remove odor-causing bacteria from the mouth.
• Outdoor exercise will bring more oxygen into the lungs and help clean out the system,
reducing bad breath.
• In the lives of many, gum disease is a major cause of bad breath. (See ""Gingivitis and
Periodontal Disease."") Place goldenseal over the infected gums or mouth sores. Do this
for 3 days, to help heal the gums.
• Far less likely, mouth breathing may cause bad breath. Yet, for many, the advantages of
mouth breathing (obtaining more oxygen than otherwise could be done) outweighs the
possible disadvantages.
• Sinus infection produces a discharge with a bad odor. If you have sinus trouble, this may
be the cause of your bad breath.
• Do not eat spicy foods.
• Meat eating can produce bad breath, both because of the particles left in the mouth and
because of later indigestion.
• Cheese and fish both cause bad breath.
• Yes, there is garlic, but it is such a powerful germ killer that you may need to take it
anyway.
• Drinking coffee, beer, wine, or whiskey are excellent ways to have bad breath. Water is
the best liquid for your body.
• Use myrrh, rosemary, or peppermint to brush your teeth and rinse your mouth.
• Avoid foods that get stuck between the teeth too easily.
• Avoid foods that are too likely to cause tooth decay, such as meat, candies, and sticky
sweets.
• Instances have been reported of food allergies having caused bad breath. Search out the
foods you are allergic to, and avoid them. (See Allergies.)
• Avoid constipation.
• In cases of bad breath caused by stomach problems, thyme tea can be helpful.
• Boil your toothbrush each month or buy a new one. Bacteria grow on the toothbrush.
Rinse it with hydrogen peroxide occasionally during the month.
• Chew fennel or anise seeds after eating an odorous meal.
• Do not use commercial mouthwashes. They irritate the mouth more than they solve any
problems. All they have is alcohol, dye, and flavoring.
Bad breath may be a sign of an underlying health problem.
—See ""Gingivitis and Periodontal Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Give the Word of God, the Bible, the honored place as the guide in your
home, and you and your family will be blessed for it. The Bible presents a perfect standard of character,
and its divine Author can give us the grace to obey it fully.

(Bad Breath)
SYMPTOMS—The breath has an unpleasant odor.
CAUSES—Touch the back of your hand with your tongue, and then smell it. This is a simple test which
may tell you something you need to know.
Not caring for your teeth properly, brushing them can be a primary cause. But tooth decay, indigestion,
improper diet, gum disease, constipation, inadequate digestion of proteins, infection in the nose or
throat, poorly functioning liver, stress, or heavy metal buildup can also be major problems."
disease-general-cheilosis,Cheilosis,"(Angular Stomatitis; Geographic Tongue)
SYMPTOMS—Cracks appear in the corners of the mouth and in the (nasolabial) corners of the nose.
On the top and sides of the tongue are irregular, denuded areas that appear very smooth. Geographic
tongue is not painful, and the sense of taste may, or may not, be affected.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—This is a nutritional problem.
• The cracks are caused by a vitamin B (riboflavin) deficiency.
2
• The geographic tongue means you are not absorbing B , B , B , B , folic acid, or zinc
3 6 5 12
properly. The cause is frequently malabsorption from celiac disease-like changes in the
small intestine.
• Do a series of pulse tests (which see) to determine the foods you may be allergic to.
Avoid those allergens; take supplementary vitamins and minerals, especially B ; the entire
2
B complex; and zinc. Also take betaine HCL before each meal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—By firm principle and unwavering trust in God, we can live clean, honest lives
that will be a blessing to all around us. This is the will of God for us.

Gas and Vomiting"
disease-general-hiccup,Hiccup,"TREATMENT
• A high blood carbon-dioxide level is known to stifle hiccups. A well-known procedure is
to breathe into a paper bag. Blow in and out exactly 10 times, and do it very hard until you
are red in the face. You must do it fast, and you must form a good seal around the bag so
no air gets in.
Hold your breath as long as you can, and then swallow when you think a hiccup is
coming. Do that 2-3 times. Then take a deep breath and begin again.
• Hold your breath in for as long as possible, then exhale and hold that as long as possible.
• Blow air out in a slow, steady stream.
• Hold your breath, while extending your head as far backward as you can.
• Swallow a teaspoonful of sugar, dry. It often stops the hiccups in minutes. The sugar in
the mouth probably sends different signals along the nerve routes, interfering with the
hiccups.
• Close your mouth, hold your nose and ears closed with your fingers and thumbs, and
swallow 3 times before you let go. This creates a slight vacuum and changes the rhythm of
the diaphragm enough to bring relief.
• Chew and swallow ice for 10-15 minutes.
• Stand behind the person as he sits on a chair. Grasp the neck gently with your fingers
and, with the thumbs, slowly massage down each side of the spinous process.
• Fill a glass of water, bend over forward, and drink the water upside down.
• Apply pressure with the flat of the hand, just below the breastbone.
• Take a deep breath and drink 10 swallows of water while not breathing.
• Put ice on the neck.
• Drink catnip tea.
• Place light fingertip pressure on each side of the neck, for about a minute.
• When you are eating, just be quiet and eat, and you are not likely to get hiccups.
• Take exactly 10 sips of water in rapid succession.
• A sneeze sometimes stops the hiccups.
• Have someone pull on your tongue.
• Lie on the left side for 10-15 minutes.
• Stand on your head.
• Swallow crushed ice.
• Deep breathing.
• Have someone massage your feet.
• Drink a half glassful of fresh orange juice.
• Take a hot bath for 15 minutes.
• Place an ice bag to the pit of the stomach.
• Bend at the waist, to touch the toes, and hold this position for about 60 seconds. This
method is useful for both adults and children.
• When children run around and play, sometimes one ends up with the hiccups. When that
happens, try tickling him while he holds his breath, and tell him to try real hard not to
laugh. He will forget about the hiccups.
• In case you have hiccups which will not stop, go on a 3 day complete fast.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The work of conquering evil is to be done through faith. Those who go into
the battlefield will find that they must put on the whole armor of God. The shield of faith must be their
defense. God will give them the victory over temptation and sin.

(Hiccough)
SYMPTOMS—Hiccups that you want to have stopped.
CAUSES—Charles Osborne of Anthon, Iowa, started hiccuping in 1922 and hiccuped for the next 65
years. After 430 million hiccups, he passed away.
Almost all hiccups are one-sided; that is, only one side of the diaphragm contracts. Overeating or
excessive drinking is the most common cause. It causes the stomach to extend downward and press
against the diaphragm—which then starts its hiccuppy motions.
A hiccup is a repeated involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, immediately followed by a
sudden closure of the glottis.
But that information does not help solve the problem. Here is advice that may. All of these methods
really work for some people. See what is best for you. (You will notice that these techniques are
frequently based on diverting attention, changing the ongoing physical hiccup pattern, and getting the
body to do something different for a few moments.)"
disease-general-belching,Belching,"TREATMENT
• Make a habit of not gulping down air as you eat. Just thinking about being more careful
will help a lot.
• Chew with your mouth closed, and do not talk while you are eating.
• Do not eat foods which produce gas, such as beans, carbonated drinks, and beer.
• Do not drink out of cans, bottles, or through a straw.
• Avoid foods with high air content. This includes ice cream, beer, omelets, and whipped
cream.
—Also see ""Bloating.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—If we would give more expression to our faith, and rejoice more in the
blessings we know we have, we could have more faith and greater joy. If you will cooperate with His
plan, as given in the Bible, He will give you eternal life.

(Eructation)
SYMPTOMS—Burping up air from the stomach.
CAUSES—Belching is most frequently caused by bringing up air that was swallowed with the food and
drink taken in. This is called aerophagia.
We normally have about a cupful of air in our stomach all the time. Every day, we swallow air and make
some in our stomach (about 10 cupfuls in 24 hours). Because this is 9 cupfuls too many, we belch
occasionally."
disease-general-bloating,Bloating,"TREATMENT
• You may wish to take 1 oz of oral hydrogen peroxide (20 drops/oz) twice a day, along
with colloidal minerals, betaine HCl (hydrochloride), and pancreatic enzymes, 75-200 mg,
three times a day. Take this 15 minutes before mealtime.
• Instead of that, you can take lemon juice and water before each meal. In your stomach,
the lemon juice will act similarly to that of HCl.
• At the time of the bloating, this can be done: If the bloating is in the stomach, seat the
person upright, apply heat over the stomach. Have him sip hot water.
• If the bloating is in the intestines, have him lie down for a half hour before, and after,
meals. Give no fluids with meals, but hot water may be sipped afterward. If needed, give
an enema.
• Avoid gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, other members of the cabbage
family, and whole wheat flour products.
• To reduce gas-causing sulfur compounds in beans (garbanzo, pinto, navy, etc.), use the
following cooking method: Place 1 cup of beans in 5 cups of water and bring to a boil.
Boil for one minute. Then drain the beans and add 5 cups of fresh water. Bring the water
to a boil and continue cooking the beans according to directions.
• Avoid lactose. Eating dairy foods can produce gas in the large bowels.
• It is possible to eat too much fiber at a time. This can induce some bloating.
• Take charcoal, to help reduce the gas. The charcoal will adsorb it and carry it off.
Activated charcoal is best.
• People who sigh often swallow air.
• Avoid tight belts and tight-fitting clothes. Those who do not wear belts and girdles have
less indigestion.
• Do not postpone bowel movements.
• Avoid drinking at water fountains. You can hardly drink at one without gulping down
air.
• A low-fat diet helps reduce carbon-dioxide production in the top (duodenal) area of the
small intestines.
• Artificial sweeteners produce gas.
• Drink enough water. A dry mouth encourages swallowing.
• Avoid repetitive belching, for you tend to swallow more air than you release.
• Both chewing gum and smoking increase the swallowing of air.
• Carbonated drinks (beer, champagne, soft drinks) and foods with whipped air cause
more food to be ingested.
• Avoid drinking with meals.
• To expel excess air, rock back and forth in the knee-chest position.
—Also see ""Stomach Distension, Gaseous,"" ""Belching,"" ""Achlorhydria,"" ""Dyspepsia,"" and ""Colic in
Children.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Living faith and obedience by faith in Christ can give us the victory over
every besetment and sin. He can enable us to stand firm to the end.
STOMACH DISTENSION, GASEOUS
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
COMBAT IT—Cold Compress over stomach without plastic covering, changed every 4 hours; Cold
Fan Douche over stomach, twice daily.
INCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE, COMBAT AUTOINTOXICATION—Short
sweating baths, such as the Radiant Heat Bath; Sweating Wet Sheet Pack; Hot Full Bath, 4-6 minutes, at
1050 F.; Hot Blanket Pack; Hot Enema. Follow each hot bath with a Tonic Friction application.
PYROSIS—Hot water drinking before retiring at night; Fomentation over stomach at bedtime, with Hot
Abdominal Pack overnight; sipping half a glass of very hot water, when rising in the morning. A few
ounces of orange juice or other natural, unsweetened fruit juice half an hour before eating.
CONSTIPATION—Graduated Cold Enema; Cold Douche to abdomen. Hot Abdominal Pack;
Regularity of bowel habits.
PAIN—Fomentation over the abdomen, followed by Heating Compress, protected by flannel only.
—Also see ""Bloating.""

(Flatulence; Gas)
SYMPTOMS—There is an excess of gas in the stomach. The stomach (or intestines) seems to be too
full.
CAUSES—Bloating is the accumulation of gas in the stomach, intestines, or bowels. Normally the
stomach is sterile because of the acid environment. But when it does not contain enough hydrochloric
acid (""Achlorhydria,"" which see), bacteria from the small intestine migrates up into the stomach.
Arriving there, it ferments the carbohydrates and sugars which are there. This produces gas or, what is
called, bloat."
disease-general-hiatal-hernia,Hiatal Hernia,"TREATMENT
• As soon as you sense heartburn coming on, drink 1-2 large glasses of water. This tends
to wash the acid back down into the stomach.
• Eat nourishing food, plus vitamin/mineral supplements. Several small meals are best.
Avoid overeating; it only intensifies the problem. Supper, if eaten at all, should be light
and 2-3 hours before bedtime. Food in the stomach, after you are in bed, is more likely to
flow back up into the windpipe. Stop eating supper entirely, and you are more likely to
have success in overcoming hiatal hernia.
• Include extra fiber; this helps soak up some of the acid.
• Avoid fried food and fats; they slow down the digestion process in the stomach. Do not
take tea, coffee, colas, alcohol, or tobacco. Avoid refined foods, including white-flour
products and sugar.
• Avoid coffee, chocolate, spicy foods, alcohol, tomatoes, mint foods, whole milk, and
possibly citrus juices.
• Avoid constipation by including fiber in the diet.
• Eat your meals on a regular schedule, and do not eat between meals. Eating between
meals causes the stomach to stop partway through, and start all over again—still with
everything from the previous meal in it.
• Even when not thirsty, drink a large glass of water every so often throughout the day.
• Avoid heavy lifting, and do not bend over more than you have to. Wait till 2 hours after
a meal before starting heavy exertion.
• Bend from the knees, not from the waist, to avoid upward pressure on the stomach.
• Daily outdoor exercise will strengthen the muscles.
• Avoid stress and stressful situations.
• Avoid tight clothing (corsets, girdles, belts, etc.)
• You may need to raise the head of the bed 4-8 inches to avoid reflux of food upward at
night.
—Also see ""Hernia"" and ""Umbilical Hernia.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We all need a guide through the many difficult places of life. But if we will
cling to God and His Written Word, the Bible, we can have the victory at each step.

(Hiatus Hernia)
SYMPTOMS—Heartburn and belching. There may be difficulty in swallowing. Material from the
stomach may suddenly return into the throat or mouth, causing a burning sensation. It may feel as if
there is a lump in the throat, or that food is sticking at a point in the throat. Sometimes bloody mucous is
coughed up.
CAUSES—The stomach pushes, or herniates, upward through an opening in the diaphragm into the
chest cavity (the thorax). A weakness in the diaphragm as it leaves the esophagus may enlarge the
opening, where the esophagus (food pipe) enters the stomach. This enables the stomach to slide up
somewhat.
The weakness is often caused by increased pressure upward, from what is in or near the abdominal
cavity: obesity, pregnancy, tumors, heavy lifting, overeating, straining at the stool, or tight clothing.
It is said that nearly half the people over 40, in the U.S., have hiatal hernias. But most are unaware of it,
since these hernias are often quite small and are hardly noticed. They occur in women four times as
often as in men, perhaps due to tight clothing. They generally first occur after the age of 40.
The acid material that comes up into the windpipe, from the larger hernias, frequently causes ulceration
in the esophageal wall.
But ulcers can also occur in the duodenum, which is the top part of the small intestine, just below the
stomach.
People with this condition have a tendency to have overacid stomachs.
Between the esophagus and stomach is the esophageal sphincter. This is a circular valve which can open
and close. But its strength is damaged by drugs, tobacco (smoked or chewed), or certain foods. This
weakening allows food and acid to go back up into the windpipe.
Those certain foods include coffee and chocolate (because of the methylxanthines in them), spicy foods,
tomato, alcohol, peppermint, spearmint, and citrus juices. Tobacco and coffee are especially bad. Whole
milk can also be a problem. Weakening of the sphincter occurs within 30 minutes after drinking coffee.
One puff of a cigarette can lower sphincter pressure to zero; the result is called ""smoker's heartburn."""
disease-general-vomiting,Vomiting,"(Emesis)
SYMPTOMS—The person vomits.
CAUSES—The cause is often overeating, eating the wrong food, poor combinations, or excessive
alcohol consumption. But it can also be caused by food allergies, poisoning, food poisoning, or infection
(flu, Epstein-Barr syndrome, candida, etc.) If the vomitus (that which comes up) looks like ""coffee
grounds,"" it includes large amounts of blood from a bleeding ulcer or stomach cancer. This is an
emergency, for extensive internal bleeding can result in death. Take him to the emergency room.
If it occurs in infants, accompanied by fever and the child is unresponsive, it could indicate meningitis.
Call a physician immediately. (See meningitis.)
But it might be that you need to induce vomiting, after someone eats a poisonous plant, rat poison, etc.
TO ASSIST VOMITING TO OCCUR—If you have eaten something poisonous or are having a
gallbladder attack, an emetic will help. Drink an emetic herb tea. Lobelia is probably the best. Make an
herb tea of lobelia or peach leaves, and take a teaspoonful every 15 minutes for 3-4 hours.
EMETIC HERBS—When giving lobelia tea, give the full dose all at once or you will not induce
vomiting. Add 1 oz lobelia to a quart of boiling water; let it steep for 5-10 minutes if you are in a hurry
(15-20 minutes is better). Then give a cup or two of the liquid (not hot), and let him vomit.
Other emetic herbs include bayberry bark, myrica, white willow, and ragwort.
In his book, Back to Eden (see order sheet), p. 260, Kloss gives a complicated formula for giving herbs
to help a person vomit. You might wish to refer to it.
TO STOP VOMITING—Give very small doses of lobelia; it will relax the person and the vomiting
will cease. Use a teaspoon of boiling water, steep, take a teaspoonful of this every 15 minutes, until
relief is obtained. A cup of hot peppermint or spearmint tea, taken after the stomach has been cleaned
out, will also help settle it. Catnip or sweet balm are also useful. A hot fomentation over the stomach, or
a hot water bottle with a moist towel under it, will help settle the stomach.
AFTER VOMITING—Do not eat for several hours, but carefully take fluids, as you are able.
You lose a lot of fluid when you vomit. Be sure and replace it. Drink water, do not become dehydrated.
Those fluids should be clear: water, weak tea, or fruit juices. Milk and heavy soups may be too much for
the stomach just then.
Drink small amounts of peppermint tea.
Vomiting also flushes out minerals. These need to be replaced with electrolyte drinks, clear soups, or
apple or cranberry juice. If only water, add a couple pinches of sugar and salt to it. After vomiting, it is
best to sip the fluids, then pause, then sip a little more; do not gulp them down. Do not drink cold fluids;
it is a shock to the weakened stomach. Do not drink carbonated products at this time.
When you are ready to eat, start back with a small carbohydrate meal, such as rice soup. Avoid fatty
substances, for they would remain in the tired stomach too long.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God bids us to fill the mind with great thoughts, pure thoughts. He desires us
to think upon His love and mercy to us; study, in the Bible, the plan He has to save us through faith in
Jesus Christ."
disease-general-dyspepsia,Dyspepsia,"TREATMENT
• Do not eat when you are in a hurry or under stress. You should be able to relax when you
eat. Do not eat when you are upset or excessively tired. Do not drink liquids with your
meal, for this dilutes your stomach juices. Take time to chew your food thoroughly.
• Eat more live (raw) foods rather than primarily heavily cooked items. Fresh, raw foods
are rich in enzymes that help digest and assimilate the nutrients. But those enzymes are
destroyed when heated to more than 120o F. All processed foods have been heated above
120o F.
• Cut down on the meat or eliminate it entirely. It is very hard to digest, and frequently
carries bacteria and parasites.
• Be sure and include enough fiber in your meal. Otherwise you are more likely to have
constipation, with consequent absorption of toxins back into the system.
• Include trace minerals in the diet (in Norway kelp and Nova Scotia dulse), and obtain
adequate vitamin and mineral supplementation. If you are having a difficult time
absorbing your food, you need to maintain good supplementation all the more.
Swallowing air (by chewing with the mouth open or talking while chewing) can cause
indigestion.
• First thing in the morning, juice a lemon and and drink it in a cup of water. This will
help prepare your stomach for its daily duties.
• Ginger is good, to lessen digestive nausea.
• Catnip, chamomile, fennel, and peppermint are all helpful in reducing indigestion. Mint
tea calms the stomach.
• Papain, papaya (containing the digestive enzyme papain), and fresh pineapple
(containing another digestive enzyme, bromelin) are also very helpful.
• Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D are needed.
• English bitters are very helpful. Take them before each meal.
• Helpful herbs include balm, bitter orange, celandine, hops, fennel, and yarrow.
• Alcohol; vinegar; caffeine; and spicy, refined, or greasy foods promotes indigestion.
• Food allergies, such as lactose intolerance, can cause it also, so locate them. (See
Allergies.) Avoid foods which tend to bother you. Take the pulse test in order to determine
yours. (See Pulse Test.)
• Do not eat too heavily of legumes, especially lentils, peanuts, and soybeans. They
contain a substance which slows down certain digestive enzymes.
• Avoid these food combinations: milk and sugar, fruits and vegetables, sugar and protein.
• Take an out-of-door walk after breakfast. If you can, do it where the air is fresh, not by a
highway.
• Keep in mind Kouchadoff's discovery. This Russian scientist experimented with cooked
food and found that, when it was eaten, the white blood cells increased rapidly in the
small intestine. As part of our immune system, they increase to fight hostile invaders. In
other words, when your white blood cell count goes up, a threatened infection or disease is
being prepared for.
• Eating raw foods protects the immune system, and does not cause an increase in white
blood cell count.
• Dr. Bircher-Benner, of Switzerland, discovered that eating raw food at a meal before
cooked food prevented the formation of white cells in the intestines. Therefore, he always
served raw salads before cooked foods.
—Now, for the other side of the coin:
• There is a theory which some accept and others reject. Consider this:
• A major cause of indigestion is eating salads and other light food at the beginning of the
meal, and waiting till partway through the meal to eat the protein foods. But protein foods
need lots of HCl for proper digestion; the other foods do not. So begin your meal with
your protein foods. You can eat salads with your protein food, but not before it.
• Which theory is correct? The truth may be in the middle: Those who have an abundance
of HCl tend to do better eating some protein at the beginning of the meal, and those who
do not have as much do better eating the raw foods, to begin with.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God purposes are right, but will prove of no avail unless resolutely carried out.
Many will be lost while hoping and desiring to be Christians; but they made no earnest effort to accept
Christ and, in His strength, obey His will as given in the Bible.

(Poor Digestion; Indigestion)
SYMPTOMS—Gas, a bloated feeling, rumbling noises, belching, possibly a burning feeling, and
vomiting.
CAUSES—The main causes are dietary habits and stress. Lack of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and enzymes
are other major causes. Lack of enzymes keep vitamins and minerals from being used properly.
Inadequate HCl means the protein food will not be digested correctly.
Other contributing factors include peptic ulcers. Intestinal obstruction can also lead to indigestion. If the
liver, pancreas, or gallbladder are not function properly, it is more difficult for the body to digest food.
A key factor can be hydrochloric acid production (see Achlorhydria).
If food does not digest properly, it tends to ferment in the intestines. This produces hydrogen and carbon-
dioxide gas, which causes bloating and pain. (See Bloating.)"

• Take lemon juice, diluted with water (or totally undiluted) at the beginning of each meal.
• Take English bitters (gentiana lutea) before each meal. These are bitter herbs which have
helped people's digestion for hundreds of years, in Europe and America.
• Take betaine HCl supplementation (75-250 mg) 15 minutes before each meal.
• Do not take antacids; they neutralize stomach acids and make the problem worse. In
addition, many of them contain aluminum and other harmful ingredients. One of these is
calcium carbonate, which will cause the stomach to produce even more HCl than before.
Magnesium compounds lead to diarrhea, and sodium bicarbonate can result in gas and
bloating.

ENCOURAGEMENT—You need not go to the end of the earth for wisdom and help. God can help
you just where you are. Give Him your life and all you are or hope to be. As you trust and obey, He
alone can keep you kind and pure.

(Insufficient stomach acid)
SYMPTOMS—Burping, belching, and bloating.
CAUSES—The stomach begins losing its ability to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) at the age of 35. Of
people over the age of 50, 75% do not produce HCl. Yet, without it, they cannot properly digest protein
foods.
When the stomach does not have enough HCl, intestinal bacteria and yeast (candida albicans) are able to
enter it and ferment high carbohydrate foods (juice, fruit, breads, etc.).
Continued low HCl production results in B , calcium, and protein deficiencies. New food allergies can
12
begin, because large fragments of food pass through the gastro-intestinal tract undigested."

disease-general-pancreatitis,Pancreatitis,"TREATMENT
• With only supportive care, the acute symptoms will fade. But some will continue to have
chronic symptoms arising so often, for months or years. This is called chronic relapsing
pancreatitis.
• It is wise to do everything possible to avoid the chronic condition or, if it is has begun,
try to clear it up as much as possible.
• Fast and take only water until the acute symptoms subside. Food in the stomach triggers
the pancreas to start working, and this you do not want just now.
• Give slippery elm enemas. Cut the slippery elm bark into very small pieces, and put a
large handful in 4 quarts of water. Simmer for 1-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Then let it
set, covered for 30 minutes. Strain and use it warm. Drink it and use in enemas.
• Place a heaping teaspoonful of lobelia in a cup of boiling water and let it steep for a half
hour; then add a tablespoon of this lobelia tea to each cup of slippery elm tea, and drink.
Also drink a cup a hour before each meal and before retiring. This will both relax and
cleanse the digestive tract.
• After coming off the fast because the acute phase is over, eat a low calorie, low fat diet.
In chronic pancreatitis, that organ often no longer produces lipase normally. Without it,
fats cannot be properly handled by the body. So eat a low fat diet for the rest of your life.
• Go on a low sugar diet. A heavy diet of refined carbohydrates can cause pancreatitis.
• Say good-bye to all alcoholic beverages, and also to caffeine.
• Avoid overeating. This also overworks the pancreas.
• There are no medications which can solve this problem. Indeed, it was medications
which may have led to it; continuing to take them may only intensify the disease.
• Even though total pancreatactomy may be recommended, avoid surgery. It will probably
only worsen the condition.
• In case of a very serious acute crisis, give frequent hot steam pack fomentations to the
abdomen. Give charcoal internally, and apply it as a poultice over the affected area. Place
the person on a strict program of what he eats and drinks.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The sinner may become a child of God, an heir of heaven. If he will but cling
to Christ and, by faith, obey His Word, he will be enabled to fulfill God's plan for His life.

Liver
# LIVER, NUTRITION OF
CARING FOR YOUR LIVER—There are few organs in your body as vital as the liver. It not only is
the largest organ, it also performs more different functions than any other organ in your body.
Only God could make the liver. That relatively small structure (it only weighs four pounds) does literally
thousands of different things; all of them are quite complicated, involving complex chemical changes.
The liver is truly a special gift from God.
There are six fundamental things which tend to damage the liver:
1 - Overeating. This is an excellent way to ruin your liver. Just eat all you want, and you
will wear it out.
2 - Eating and drinking the wrong things. Here are some of those items which your liver
does not wish to face: refined white flour-products, processed foods, junk foods, white
sugar products, imitation foods. Beware of potato chips and corn chips.
What is an imitation food? It is a food made to appear like the original, yet which has been
stripped of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and most everything else that might be
worthwhile while carbohydrates, sugar, fats, protein, synthetic colors, flavors, and odors
are there to give the appearance and taste of real food.
3 - A low protein, high carbohydrate and fat diet. To make it even worse, make sure it is
full of saturated or hydrogenated fats. All kinds of snacks in the stores consist of this.
Fried foods may be a devilish delight, but they only add to the eventual misery.
4 - Take the specialty food poisons: alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, theobromine, and hard
drugs.
5 - Take medicinal drugs. Select from over-the-counter items or those which are
prescribed. They will provide you with a real witch's brew of physical horror, much of it
not known and realized until later. With hardly an exception, medicinal drugs are poisons.
The liver has to work overtime in order to try to excrete these dangerous chemicals.
Some substances which are called ""drugs,"" such as charcoal, are not drugs. They are
natural substances which help your body. It is true there are some poisonous herbs, but
these will be readily found in the drugstore. The rest, found in the meadow and forest, are
for the healing of the nations.
6 - Associate closely with insecticides, preservatives, and other cumulative poisons. Some
poisons directly damage the liver (alcohol, oral contraceptives, caffeine, etc.); others
damage organs which the liver relies on for help (the pancreas, kidneys, etc.).
Here are some dietary suggestions:
Do not use nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, fish, fowl, meat, salt, soft drinks, sugar foods, tea,
or fried foods.
Avoid foods which tend to constipate. When there is a backup in the large colon, toxins
are reabsorbed into the system, and the liver labors to eliminate them.
Make sure you obtain foods high in potassium. This includes rice, bananas, blackstrap
molasses, wheat bran, almonds, seeds, kelp and dulse, brewer's yeast, prunes, and raisins.
Drink lots of water; and, if at all possible, drink only pure water. Drink a little every hour.
Emphasize raw foods in your diet.
Drink fresh vegetable juices, especially carrot and beet.
Only eat raw nuts and seeds. They must be fresh and not stale!
Use only cold-pressed vegetable oils,—and no other type of oils and no grease (margarine,
butter, shortening, or meat fat).
Vitamin K is important, to help prevent cirrhosis of the liver.
Do not take too much vitamin A. For the same reason, do not eat fish more than twice a
week. Avoid cod liver oil. Better yet, stop eating fish. Meat eating is also harmful to the
liver. Anyone taking over 50,000 IU of vitamin A for over a year should either reduce
intake or switch to natural beta-carotene, which is safe.
Do not drink milk or eat pastries, stimulants, white rice, black or white pepper, fried or
fatty foods, cheese, and refined or processed foods.
Never eat raw or undercooked fish, meat, or poultry. There is a serious risk of infection
from doing this. Meat eating is a major source of bacteria parasites, viruses, and various
malignancies.
When taking supplements, either chew them up well or take them with a glassful of water.
Use celandine and silymarin (which is milk thistle extract) every day to help maintain
good liver function. But do not use celandine during pregnancy.
The lemon and the liver are sweethearts. The lemon is one of the best friends that the liver
has.
Coenzyme Q10 helps supply oxygen to the liver.
Lecithin helps prevent fatty buildup in the liver.
In addition to taking care of your liver, treat your kidneys well also. Poor kidney function
results in damage to the liver. Drink water! (See ""Kidney problems."")
Do not use harsh laxatives. But do keep the colon clean.
Take no drugs if you want your future years to be happy ones.
Be good to your liver, and it will help you in years to come. It is a well-known fact,
among natural healers, that, if the liver is all right, cancer can be eliminated. But if the
liver is too far degenerated, the hoped-for solution may not be achieved.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The knowledge of God is as high as heaven, yet He can reveal to you all you
need, just for today, if you will but give your life daily into His hands.

SYMPTOMS—Acute cases: A sudden attack of severe burning or stabbing pain in the upper abdomen,
possibly accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain may spread to the back and is made worse by
moving. Food, alcohol, and vomiting may worsen the pain.
Chronic cases: The pain is milder and pain attacks do not come on suddenly. There is excessive gas,
muscle aches, and fever. Permanent damage to the pancreas can occur, because the constant
inflammation can produce fibrosis in that organ. The chronic state results in irreversible changes in the
gallbladder.
Other symptoms of pancreatitis include abdominal swelling and distension, hypertension, sweating, and
abnormal fatty stools.
Diabetes, digestive problems, and cancer can also result, as well as hearing, respiratory, and kidney
failure.
CAUSES—Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Normal cells are replaced with scar tissue and
calcium deposits. It frequently produces mild diabetes.
The most frequent causes of pancreatitis are drinking alcohol, viral infection, and diseases of the bile
ducts or gallbladder. A diet rich in fats and meat lays a solid foundation for pancreatitis to occur. Other
causes include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, and a considerable variety of prescribed
medications. Oral contraceptives, steroids, estrogen, and ACTH can also do it.
To this list should be added abdominal injury, obesity, poor nutrition, and electric shock.
Certain diseases can also induce it: hepatitis, mumps, and possibly anorexia nervosa.
The pancreas produces two important hormones: insulin and glucagon; both of which regulate blood
sugar levels and aid digestion. As a result, pancreatitis can produce glucose intolerance and diabetes."

• Give him bed rest, keep his bowels open, using daily enemas if necessary.
• If he can take food, give him a liquid diet. Plenty of water is also needed.
• Carefully dispose of all his discharges, so as not to contaminate anything.
• Do everything possible to exterminate rats.
• Avoid swimming in, or contact with, water that may be contaminated with animal waste.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ has a treasure house full of precious gifts for every soul willing to
receive it. But only by dedication, submission, and obedience in Christ's strength—can we have it.
CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER—1
SYMPTOMS—Upset stomach, fever, constipation or diarrhea, weakness, weight loss, poor appetite,
vomiting, enlarged liver, and red palms. Fluid collects in the abdomen. Possible mild jaundice. Large
veins often seen over the abdomen, especially about the navel and across the body near the diaphragm.
Enlarged veins in the rectum, intestines, stomach, and esophagus.
In the later stages, anemia, edema, and easy bruising, due to bleeding beneath the skin.
CAUSES—Cirrhosis is a hardening of the liver, because of too much connective tissue and a
degeneration of the active liver cells.
It can be caused by certain poisons, chief among which is alcohol. Certain infectious diseases can cause
special types of liver cirrhosis, of which viral hepatitis is outstanding (see hepatitis). This is especially
true of syphilis (which see), which produces nodes in the liver. Malnutrition, caused by lack of food or
eating junk food, can also lead to cirrhosis.
The liver cells harden and scar, causing them to no longer function normally, due to the scarred tissue.
This prevents the blood from passing properly through the liver.
• Eat a good nourishing diet and go off all meat, tea, coffee, or spices.
• Silymarin helps the liver.
• Helpful herbs include burdock, celandine, barberry, echinacea, goldenseal, fennel, red
clover, and thyme.
• Follow the program for hepatitis and jaundice, both of which see.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God has provided abundant means for successful warfare against the evil that
is in the world. The Bible is the armory where we may equip for the struggle. The shield of faith must be
in our hand, the helmet of salvation on our brow.

—Also see ""Cirrhosis of the Liver—1.""
# LIVER FLUSH
WHAT IT IS—The liver filters the blood and excretes much of that waste through the bile, which it
sends into the gallbladder. When some oil or fat is in a meal, its presence signals the gallbladder to
contract and squeeze out some bile, which helps prepare those oils and fats to be properly absorbed by
the body.
A liver flush occurs when much of the bile is flushed out of the gallbladder. However, there is the
possibility that gallstones may be in the bladder. So phase one of the liver flush is to melt down those
stones; and then, in the concluding phase, the bile and the stones are jolted out of the gallbladder into the
small intestine.
HOW TO DO IT—There are several ways this can be done:
1 - This method is used for the purpose of flushing out gallstones, after first softening them:
Take 3 tbsp. of olive oil with the juice of a lemon before bed and upon awakening. Stones are often
passed and eliminated in the stool with this method. Look for them. You can use grapefruit juice instead
of lemon juice.
2 - Here is a more involved three-day pattern for more effectively flushing gallstones:
Go on a liver flush by drinking apple juice alone for 3 days. On the third day, the juice is followed by
drinking a cup of olive oil and a cup of lemon juice.
3 - This method is used for cleaning out the liver and gallbladder rather than eliminating stones:
To cleanse the liver and gallbladder, drink as much pure apple juice as possible for 5 days. Add pear
juice occasionally. Beet juice also cleanses the liver.
4 - Here is a more complicated formula for doing the same thing:
On two evenings, drink 1 cup of a mixture, composed of equal parts of fresh lemon juice and olive oil (2
oz of each). On the third evening, take a double dose (4 oz of each).
On the following morning, take an enema, then a second enema to which 1 cup freshly brewed coffee
has been added. This coffee enema should be retained for as long as possible—up to 20 minutes. Repeat
this coffee enema in the evening.
The above treatment tends to cleanse the liver of toxins and impurities. Coffee, although never suitable
for drinking orally, has the peculiar quality of cleansing the liver when taken in enema form. As such, it
is widely used to purify the liver so it can resist cancer and throw it off. It is well-known, among natural
healers, that the body can eliminate cancer if the liver is in good condition. (See cancer.)
In no other way is coffee ever useful inside the body; but, as medicine to cleanse the liver, it has been
used with marked success.
5 - This is a still more involved regime for restoring the functioning capacity of the liver and
gallbladder. Slightly different than #2, above, it should not be used on anyone below the age of 25 or
who has large gallstones:
On Tuesday through Sunday noon, drink as much apple juice or apple cider as you are able, in addition
to your regular meals.
At noon on Sunday, eat a normal lunch.
Three hours later, dissolve 2 tsp. of disodium phosphate in an ounce of hot water, and drink it. It may
not taste good, so follow it with a little freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.
Two hours later, repeat the drinking of the disodium phosphate and the grapefruit juice.
That evening, only take citrus juice for supper.
At bedtime, either (1) drink a half cup of unrefined olive oil, followed by a small glass of grapefruit
juice or (2) drink a half cup of warm, unrefined olive oil blended with a half cup of lemon juice.
Go immediately to bed and lie on your right side with your right knee pulled up close to your chest for
30 minutes.
The next morning, one hour before breakfast, drink 2 tsp. disodium phosphate, dissolved in 2 oz of hot
water.
Eat your meals as usual. The cleansing regime of the liver and gallbladder is completed.
In case there is slight to moderate nausea when taking the olive oil and citrus juice, this should be gone
by the time you go to sleep.
But if the oil induces vomiting (which only happens rarely), you need not repeat the procedure at this
time. Drink a cup of strong peppermint tea, to help relieve the nausea.
You may find small gallstones in the stool the following day. They look light green to dark green, are
very irregular in shape, are the size of grape seeds to cherry seeds, and feel like gelatin. If there are a
large number of them, repeat the liver flush in two weeks.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We see in the Word of God warnings and promises, with God behind them all.
We are invited to search this Word for aid when brought into difficult places. If we place God and the
Bible first, we will have divine help in meeting all our problems.

Gallbladder

(Weil's Disease, Leptospirosis, Spirochetal Jaundice)
SYMPTOMS—Sudden fever, chills, anemia, jaundice, sometimes abdominal pains, and occasionally
aseptic meningitis.
Within a few hours, fever, extreme thirst, and severe aching of the limbs develop. Blood vessels in the
eyeballs markedly enlarged. Jaundice appears in about half the cases. In locations where the disease is
common, mortality is about 10-20%.
This disease can easily be diagnosed as something else. It is important to determine the true nature of the
infection early.
CAUSES—This is an infectious disease caused by the leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, a spirochete
bacteria. Rats, dogs, and various wild animals carry it. People are infected when urine-contaminated
water (generally from rats) penetrates cuts on their fingers or during butchering and skinning of infected
animals. The rats are not harmed by the disease.
Leptospire is a parasite which travels to the liver and greatly multiplies there, but can also be found in
the blood (in the early stages) and in the urine (later). Blood tests or urine cultures are necessary for
diagnosis."

• Take English bitters, along with folic acid, pectin, and eat as carefully as you can. Take
full vitamin/mineral supplementation.
• Lie down for half an hour after each meal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—That heart is the happiest that has Christ as an abiding guest. In this world
there is neither comfort nor happiness without Jesus. Oh, may we so live, during this brief period of
probationary life, that we shall be with Him throughout the ages to come.
APPENDICITIS, ACUTE
SYMPTOMS—Pain and tenderness in the lower right area of the abdomen, vomiting, and low-grade
fever. In children, the fever can be quite high.
The first symptom usually is pain. There may be tenderness with pressure. Quickly the pain becomes
severe. But sometimes the pain is first felt all over the abdomen, and may be especially strong over the
naval.
But pain and tenderness with pressure are not enough symptoms to determine appendicitis. There will
also be rigidity and tenderness of the muscles of the abdominal wall, especially on the right side, a little
below the level of the naval. Coughing and deep breathing make the pain worse.
The attack may, or may not, begin with a chill; but generally some, or much, fever is present from the
beginning—along with constipation, vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, and a tendency while lying in
bed to draw up the right leg to relieve tension on the sore side.
CAUSES—The appendix is located on the right side of the abdomen, about halfway between the point
of the hipbone and the naval.
Causes of appendicitis include constipation; overeating; eating rich, complicated foods and foods low in
fiber. The resulting fermentation and digestive upset can produce appendicitis.
IF THE APPENDIX RUPTURES, the infection will spill into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis.
Take him to a hospital immediately, so he does not die!
• Do not wait. Call a physician.
• The inflammation may subside if the person is put to bed and the infected tissues are
kept quiet and not irritated.
• Do not give a cathartic; that is, do not swallow laxatives or laxative herbs, to flush out
the gastro-intestinal tract !! This can cause the appendix to rupture!
• Undertake a water fast immediately. Drink small amounts every so often. Take 2 myrrh/
goldenseal capsules every 2 hours. Take echinacea 4 times a day.
• Immediately give a colonic or high enema as follows:
• Give an enema of the lower bowel (the descending colon). As you do this, massage that
part of the colon downward toward the rectum.
• Then, always gently, slowly, and carefully, go up higher into the ascending colon and
massage it toward the rectum.
• Then slowly massage upward on the upper part of the ascending colon. Then very
lightly, partway down the ascending colon, gently massage upward. Each time, continue
the massage all the way across the transverse colon and down the descending colon.
• Constantly be on the alert for indications that the appendix may have burst !!! If there is
a most terrible pain, rush the person to the hospital at once. If you wait beyond that point,
he may die.
• When the attack phase of appendicitis is past, and all is better, break the water fast by
going on a fruit diet for 2 days.
• Then go on a cleansing, building diet of nourishing food. Do not eat too much at a time.
Include 1 tsp. psyllium in juice or water, 3 times a day, for 2 weeks after the appendicitis
has ceased.
HYDRO—The following hydrotherapy information comes from the author's book, Water Therapy
Manual (see order sheet):
The objective here is to draw the inflammation away from the appendix. There are two ways to do this.
Start it immediately when the appendix attacks occurs:
The first application is based on the reflex principle. Water applications, placed on certain areas of the
body, will affect other areas (p. 25). The naval affects the appendix. So place an ice cap or ice bag
(about one-half full of finely chopped ice) on the naval. This will draw inflammation away from the
appendix (p. 50).
The second application is based on the derivation principle. You can draw blood away from one area, by
placing hot packs on a distant area. A hot Hip-and-Leg Pack is applied, plus placing an ice bag on the
appendicial area (p. 97).
Many cases of appendicitis heal without need for an operation to remove the appendix. But you must be
very careful.
—Also see ""Appendicitis, Chronic,"" just below.
One of the false theories, dreamed up by evolutionists nearly a century ago, was the idea that many
organs in the human body are useless and only relics given us by our ancestors. But, in recent decades,
all of these ""useless"" organs (including the thyroid) have been found to have important functions. The
tonsils protect the gastro-intestinal tract where it begins, and the appendicitis guards it where the small
intestines end. The appendix is a lymphatic structure.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Let your confidence in the enabling power of Christ increase daily. He alone
can enable you to resist temptation. He alone can give you the guidance you need throughout the day.
APPENDICITIS, CHRONIC
SYMPTOMS—Pain and tenderness in the lower right area of the abdomen, vomiting. This occurs every
so often.
CAUSES—This is NOT acute appendicitis, but chronic appendicitis. Relatively few individuals have
ongoing problems with their appendix, which do not come into the acute phase. But some do.
Chronic appendicitis is an on again, off again type of problem. For such individuals, it might be best to
have the appendix removed rather than to suffer with it as the months pass.
If used at all, the following applications may be used only for ongoing chronic appendicitis, NOT for the
acute phase, when a person experiences a sudden attack!!
The following method requires the placing of heat over the appendix area. This would not be done for
acute appendicitis.
• Prepare a castor oil pack in this manner: Place a folded wool flannel in a Pyrex glass or
enamel baking pan. Pour castor oil over the cloth until it is saturated. Heat it in the oven to
about 225o F., but get it no hotter than you can touch. It will be heated in 5-10 minutes.
• Or, instead of putting in in the oven, put the neutral pack on the appendix area and apply
a heating pad over it. Next put a waterproof covering over the pack. Over this, place a hot-
water bottle half filled with hot water. Wrap a bath towel around the body, to secure the
water bottle and pack. Cover everything with a heavy blanket or sleeping bag, to hold in
the warmth.
• Remove it 1-2 hours later. In order to avoid a rash, clean the oil off the skin with a
solution of 2
tsps. of baking soda to 1 quart water. Do it gently. Do not try to wash the castor oil out of
the pack or any cloth involved; castor oil cannot be washed out. You can use the same
pack again later, by adding some more castor oil and reheating. It can be reused for 6
weeks.
• Use the pack for 3-4 nights and then not use it for 3 nights. Then begin again.
• Do not spill the castor oil on anything valuable.
—For more information on appendicitis, see ""Appendicitis, Acute.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We can have a daily living experience in the willingness and power of Christ
to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him. Let Him be the center of your affections. He is
the best friend you could ever have.

Bowel
CONSTIPATION—1
SYMPTOMS—Stools are hard, dry, and infrequent. It is difficult to have a bowel movement.
Other symptoms may include abdominal discomfort, lack of energy, dull headache, poor appetite, and
low back pain.
CAUSES—""Constipation"" comes from the Latin, and means ""crowded together.""
The bowels should move daily, ideally, after each meal. When this does not happen, waste material
moves too slowly through the large bowel. Elimination becomes painful, and toxins are reabsorbed by
the system, placing an overload on the liver and kidneys. All waste in the body should be expelled
within 18-24 hours.
A number of different physical problems are partially caused by constipation: bad breath, body odor,
depression, appendicitis, fatigue, gas, headaches, hernia, indigestion, the malabsorption syndrome,
varicose veins, obesity, insomnia, and the coated tongue.
Toxins, reabsorbed from a constipated bowel, can also result in migraines, chronic gas and bloating,
thyroid problems, meningitis, and myasthenia gravis.
Constipation tends to be common during pregnancy.
Older people often have constipation because they are not drinking enough water.
Persons with spinal injuries may have problems with constipation, due to damage to certain nerves.
• Include enough fiber in your diet each day. Drink enough water. Get enough exercise,
especially out-of-doors, so you get enough fresh air. Avoid poisonous substances and
emotional tension. Relax, thank God for your blessings, and take time to be a blessing to
others. Follow the advice in this paragraph, and many of your problems will vanish.
• As soon as you awake, start drinking warm water, a little at a time. By the time you are
ready for breakfast, you should have at least taken a quart. Faithfully following this
regime, you will tend to develop regularity in your morning bowel movement. This plan
nicely starts the day off right.
• Then, after breakfast and every other meal, go outside and walk a little or a lot. Breathe
deeply.
• The larger the amount of fiber in the diet, the larger and softer will the stools be.
• Eat smaller amounts of food at each meal.
Concentrated foods, such as meats, sugar, and cheese are excellent for producing
constipation.
• Dairy foods, soft drinks, white flour, salt, coffee, alcohol, highly processed foods, and
sugary foods should not be used, if you want to solve this problem.
• Iron supplements cause constipation. So do painkillers and antidepressants.
• All decongestants and antihistamines are drying agents, and may cause the stool to
become dryer than it should.
• Eat prunes or figs. Flaxseed meal (best freshly ground) is helpful. Both will soften
stools. Psyllium seed is also good, but take it quickly with a full glassful of water.
• When necessary, take cleansing enemas to relieve the load on the bowel. But the solution
is better living, not reliance on enemas.
• A small, cold enema helps eliminate the enema habit. (See ""Enema Habit, how to
overcome."")
• There is always the possibility that, if constipation occurs too frequently, that cancer, or
some other obstruction of the bowel, may be involved. Other symptoms of colon cancer
include severe cramping; blood in the stool; a tender, distended abdomen; and very
narrowed feces. But cancer can be present without these symptoms occurring.
• Alternate diarrhea and constipation may point to irritable bowel syndrome (which see).
—Also see ""Constipation—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The fallen world is the battlefield for the greatest conflict the heavenly
universe and earthly powers have ever witnessed. It is fought anew in the life of every person born into
this world. Both Christ and Satan want to have the control of your life. The choice is yours; which shall
it be?
CONSTIPATION—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
INCREASE PERISTALTIC ACTIVITY—Drink half a pint to a pint of cold water before breakfast,
preferably distilled water. Increase the bulk of food, with free use of fruit, especially apples, oranges,
and figs; also brand cakes, etc. (instead of so much smooth, non-fibrous food). Small Cold Enema;
Graduated Enema; Fomentation over liver twice daily, followed by Heating Compress during interval
between. Hot Abdominal pack at night; Abdominal massage; Cold Fan Douche to abdomen; Cold
Percussion Douche to spine; Cold Planter Douche for 1-3 minutes; Cold Rubbing Sitz Bath at 700-750
F., 5-20 minutes. Avoid complete emptying of colon, using small Cold Enema instead of a large quantity
of warm water, except when necessary, to relieve autointoxication or remove hardened, impacted feces.
If necessary, introduce into rectum, as high as possible, at night or before breakfast, to be retained till the
next bowel movement, a small pledget of cotton saturated with raw linseed oil or with glycerin.
INCREASE ACTIVITY OF INTESTINAL GLANDS—Half a pint to a pint of water at bedtime, to
be retained overnight; abdominal message; Hot Abdominal Pack, without plastic covering.
REMOVE ACCUMULATED FECAL MATTER—Large Hot Enema or Hot Colonic; Neutral
Enema; oil retention (oil enema to be retained throughout the night). Repeat the application till bowel is
thoroughly emptied, then inject a pint of water at 750-700 F., to tone the bowel.
DILATION OF THE COLON—Graduated enema; Cold fan Douche to abdomen and spine opposite
the stomach; running Cold Foot Bath; Cold Rubbing Sitz Bath; Hot Abdominal Pack, without plastic
covering, changing every 4 hours.
INCREASE STRENGTH OF ABDOMINAL MUSCLES—Cold fan Douche; Cold Plantar Douche;
Percussion Abdominal Douche; Cold Compress to abdomen, renewed every 4 hours without impervious
covering; massage; special exercises, particularly head raising and leg raising while lying on one's back.
ENTEROPTOSIS—Restore prolapsed bowels to position; strengthen abdominal muscles as indicated
above; correct normal sitting position; abdominal supporter.
HEMORRHOIDS—Long Cold Sitz Bath; Cool Anal douche; Cold Compress to anal area; small Cold
Enema; if inflamed, rest in bed; Fomentations over the nates, followed by cold compress. Repeat
Fomentations every 3 hours.
PAIN—(1) If due to a fissure: hot applications, sitting over steam [hot vapor, not actual ""steam""]. (2) If
due to irritable rectum: hot colonic. (3) If due to pain in abdomen: Revulsive Compress; Revulsive
Douche; Hot Enema at 1100 F., followed by small cool Enema; Revulsive Sitz Bath.
RELIEVE SPASM OF SPHINCTER ANI MUSCLE—Prolonged Neutral or Hot Sitz Bath; Warm
Colonic; Hot Colonic; Fomentations over the nates (the ""nates"" are the fleshy prominences formed by
the gluteal muscles—the area where a child is spanked).
RESTORE SENSIBILITY OF RECTUM—Alternate Hot and Cold Colonic, Cold Douche to lower
spine and nates. Shallow Cold Sitz, Cold Anal Douche, Alternate Anal Douche.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Strictly avoid Sweating Baths that sometimes induce Constipation, also
abuse of the Fomentation and the habitual use of the Warm Enema, which should be strictly avoided. If
the Enema is used daily, the temperature, at least at the conclusion of the enema, should be 650-75o F.,
so that a tonic effect may be secured.
GENERAL METHOD—Each case must be carefully studied, with reference to the leading cause or
causes which are operative in the individual case. Most important of these are the following: aparalytic
or atonic condition of the intestine through disturbed or defective innervation; diminished intestinal
secretion or an abnormal absorption of intestinal secretion, resulting in unusually dry and solid fecal
mass; dilatation of the colon, giving rise to accumulation; relaxation and weakness of the abdominal
muscles with lowered intra-abdominal tension; hemorrhoids and other diseases of the rectum; prolapse
of the colon and other abdominal viscera; loss of normal sensibility of the rectum; spasm of the anal
sphincter muscle.
—Also see ""Constipation—1.""
DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY—1
SYMPTOMS—Frequent and loose watery bowel movements. This is often accompanied by cramping,
abdominal pain, thirst, sudden need to eliminate, vomiting, and possible fever.
CAUSES—Severe diarrhea can produce a loss of essential electrolytes, such as potassium, and result in
pale pallor, listlessness, and dark circles under the eyes.
Diarrhea in infants is serious. Something must be done right away. If the child has five or more watery
stools a day, consider it diarrhea.
Possible causes include overeating, food poisoning, stress, incomplete digestion of food, taking certain
drugs, flu, intestinal parasites, caffeine, contaminated water, infection (viral or bacterial), eating certain
foods (such as unripe fruit, spoiled protein, or rancid fats), eating soap (from improperly rinsed dishes),
ingesting certain chemicals, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, etc.),
cancer, traveling to foreign countries, poor digestion, or lactose intolerance from milk products. Giardia
lamblia, a microscopic parasite, is the most common form of water-borne infestation in the United
States.
A rich meal of wine, lobster, creamy desserts and all the trimmings is a good start toward diarrhea. It is
all too much for the body to handle. The body rejects the whole thing and sends it all out.
Dysentery is diarrhea which is caused either by a disease organism of some kind or overeating of rich
food. The symptoms are the same as diarrhea, but may be longer lasting.
Prevention requires cleanly food sources, careful food storage and preparation, self-discipline, and
cleanliness.
• Because of the ongoing diarrhea, people with IBS require as much as 30% more protein
than normal, as well as an increased intake of minerals and trace elements.
• Avoid xanthine-containing foods such as chocolate, tea, coffee, and spicy foods. Also
avoid drugs, cold liquids, and carbonated beverages. All these may produce diarrhea.
• Milk may also induce diarrhea. Lactose intolerance and virus are leading causes of
diarrhea.
• In case of chronic diarrhea, electrolyte and trace mineral deficiencies are likely. Rice
water, lime water, potato broth, and fruit will help restore lost electrolytes.
• It is recommended that no raw fruit juices be given until the acute stage is past.
• Garlic is helpful in helping purify the gastro-intestinal tract.
• Carob powder is high in protein and helps stop diarrhea.
• Keep liquid consumption high, in order to replace lost fluids.
• Antacids are the most common cause of drug-related diarrhea. Antibiotics and a number
of other medicinal drugs cause it also.
• While you have diarrhea, do not prepare food for others, and wash your hands carefully.
• Some say to use bran and pectin foods, in order to tighten the bowels and stop the
diarrhea; others say to let it run its course, in order to rid the problem foods, etc., out of
the system. But, generally, it is considered best to use fiber foods to get the diarrhea
stopped. When increasing fiber intake, also increase fluid intake.
• The deciding factor is whether the diarrhea was caused by a bacteria or virus. If so, you
want the body to throw it off through the bowels, if (if) this will happen fairly rapidly.
• Helpful herbs include white oak bark, an astringent which stops diarrhea. Also useful are
American blackberry, barley, clove root, whortleberry, black currant, burdock, and
echinacea.
—Also see ""Diarrhea, Chronic,"" and ""Diarrhea in Infants."" Also see ""Turista"" for more on preventing
and terminating diarrhea.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If Christ abides in your heart, you will be happy and full of praise and joy.
The crises of life are as nothing compared to the bright future God has in store for you. Stand true to
Him, and soon heaven will be yours.

SYMPTOMS—The food entering the stomach is suddenly dumped into the small intestine instead of
remaining in the stomach, to be initially digested.
CAUSES—The dumping syndrome is a common side effect of stomach surgery. It can continue for
quite some time.
Because proteins are not properly digested, the small intestine becomes very acid—when it requires an
alkaline environment to function properly. Anemia and osteoporosis are frequent secondary results of
the dumping syndrome.
The solution is to not let them operate on your stomach."
disease-general-turista,Turista,"TREATMENT
• American travelers are often given Entero-Vioform tablets, which they are instructed to
take several times a day. But those medications are forbidden in Japan and Sweden,
because they can cause severe nerve and eye damage.
• Instead, take betaine hydrochloride (betaine HCl) tablets with you when you travel, and
swallow two tablets after each meal. The hydrochloric acid will kill bacteria in the
stomach and help prevent infection.
• Straight lemon or lime juice, taken on an empty stomach, also has an sterilizing effect.
• To make the situation even better, eat some raw garlic with your meals.
• In cases of non-bacterial diarrhea, 3 tbsp. of raw, unprocessed wheat bran daily, taken in
fruit juice, has been found to give relief.
Here are more ideas for preventing turista from happening to you:
• Drink acidic drinks, such as fruit juice or whatever else you can get overseas. If you
cannot do better, drink carbonated beverages sealed in bottles or cans.
• Try to make sure the dishes and eating utensils have been cleaned in purified water, and,
hopefully, rinsed in very hot water.
• Avoid uncooked vegetables. This includes salads, fruits you cannot peel, ice cubes, and
anything that unpurified water is in.
• Boil water for 3-5 minutes to purify it. Iodine liquid or tablets purifies it also.
There is danger, when traveling overseas (or even if you remain at home) that the diarrhea may indicate
something more serious:
• Abdominal bloating, vomiting, and pain can point to colitis, appendicitis, or an intestinal
obstruction.
• Black or red stools can indicate bleeding or a parasitic infection.
• White or pale stools can signify disease of the liver.
• If fever occurs with the diarrhea, then a serious infection may be involved.
• Amoebic dysentery is a serious problem in Mexico, Central America, and a number of
other places. If you contract it, garlic, goldenseal, colchicum, peppermint, and ginger have
been used successfully against it. When in doubt, burn a wooden box, gather the charcoal
together and swallow it in water.
Here are other homemade ways to eliminate diarrhea:
• Take dried blueberries with you. They tend to constipate and thus eliminate the diarrhea.
Blackberry root is equally good. Make it into a tea and drink it.
• Plantain is strongly astringent, so is white oak bark.
• Cook down apple peels and drink it. The pectin in it helps eliminate diarrhea.
• Tannic acid is in acorns and oak bark. It is a powerful astringent, and will stop the
muscular contractions of the intestines.
• Not only charcoal, but clay is also useful in stopping diarrhea. Many commercial
antidiarrheal preparations contain clay.
—Also see ""Diarrhea and Dysentery.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Happy is the man who has discovered for himself that the Word of God is a
light to his feet and a lamp to his path. It is alight shining in a dark place. It is heaven's guidebook for
mankind.

SYMPTOMS—Diarrhea when traveling in foreign countries, otherwise you may not feel sick.
CAUSES—Hygienic conditions and bacterial flora are different in other countries. The nationals are
used to it; but, arriving in that strange land, it can be too much for you.
One problem is foreign versions of the escherichia coli bacteria. Foreign versions produce a toxin that
prevents your intestines from absorbing the water you ingest in food and drink. The result is diarrhea.
Salmonella and shigella bacteria can also produce turista, and a smaller number of cases are caused by
rotavirus or the giardia parasite.
Up to 50% of turista cases are unexplained, but suspicion is pointed to fatigue, changes in diet, jet lag,
and altitude sickness.
Seasoned travelers say that there is a 50% chance you will get diarrhea if you visit overseas, even if you
take the recommended precautions. But here they are anyway:"
disease-general-colitis,Colitis,"TREATMENT
• High-fiber foods are very important, also drinking lots of water.
• To begin with, do not eat raw greens, carrots, or peanuts. Eat cooked or steamed green
leafy vegetables, cooked white potatoes, multigrain bread, and well-cooked oat bran,
brown rice, millet, sweet potatoes, bananas, cooked carrots, squash, and avocados.
• Drink fresh, raw cabbage, carrot, celery and parsley juices, to help heal the colitis.
• Do not eat fruit on an empty stomach, but at the end of the meal, until the colitis is gone.
• Avoid milk products, for they irritate the colon. Wheat products may do it also.
• Poorly digested roughage can be the problem. Chew your food well. Your intestines
need fiber, but not chunks of food.
• Undigested cereals and carbohydrates are another cause. Take digestive enzymes and
smaller, more frequent, meals.
• Use the pulse test, to ascertain whether allergic foods are being eaten. (See ""Pulse Test."")
• When no open peptic or intestinal ulcers are present, take 2-3 tablets of betaine
hydrochloride (betaine HCl) after each meal with a glass of water. This will help the
stomach digest proteins and carbohydrates.
• Slippery elm is very soothing and healing to the bowel. Mix one tsp. of powdered
slippery elm with one pint of boiling water, blend well, add something for flavoring, and
drink slowly.
• Alfalfa, garlic, and papaya are also useful.
• Helpful herbs include aloe vera, myrrh, and pau d'arco.
—Also see ""Crohn's Disease"" for additional information on ulcerative colitis. See ""Irritable Bowel
Syndrome"" for more on colitis.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We are to love God with all our mind, and soul, and body. Give Him your life,
and let Him use you to be a blessing to all those around you. There is no other way to be genuinely
happy.

(Ulcerative Colitis)
SYMPTOMS—Bloody diarrhea, bloody mucous, gas, pain, bloating, incomplete elimination of the
bowels, weakness, weight loss, indigestion, headaches, and sometimes hard stools. Diverticula are often
produced.
CAUSES—Colitis is a disease of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis is a more severe variation of it.
The symptoms and treatment of both are about the same.
Colitis is a chronic infection of the lower bowel. The mucous membrane wall becomes irritated as a
result of fecal matter which has accumulated, because of constipation. In other words, the person did not
have regular bowel movements, and so the bowel wall became infected as a result.
Over-the-counter laxatives, cooking in aluminum utensils, overeating of refined carbohydrates, too
much sugar in the diet, and food allergies are other causes.
Constipation causes the person to strain. This produces diverticula (see ""Diverticulitis""), small pockets
which fill with waste matter and toxins.
Low-fiber diets, wrong food combinations, and poor bowel habits—all work together to cause trouble.
Toxic bacteria multiplies quickly when retained in the lower bowel too long.
Nervous tension and emotional stress intensifies the problem.
Antibiotics change the intestinal flora, and that can also produce colitis.
It is important that you try to find the underlying cause of the colitis, otherwise it will be difficult to
eliminate it.
More rarely, the intestinal wall weakens, balloons out, and could possibly rupture. This is called toxic
magacolon."
disease-general-crohn-s-disease,Crohn'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• A fat-free diet helps. It is known that those with Crohn's disease cannot absorb fats well
and do not tolerate high-fat diets.
• Do not use spices, such as mustard, vinegar, pepper, and horseradish.
• Drink plenty of liquids, such as distilled water and fresh juices.
• Cabbage juice contains vitamin U, the anti-ulcer vitamin, which is good for the walls of
the GI tract.
• Of course, eat no junk food, tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, and useless things which only
harm you.
• Eliminate all food additives. Do not use sugar or sugar foods. One study revealed that
patients contracting Crohn's disease had previously been eating more sugar than the
average population. Eat high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrates (whole grains). However,
gradually increase the fiber content, all the while chewing well, so as not to irritate the GI
tract. If you cannot chew well, then blend the food.
• Individuals who contracted Crohn's disease were found to have eaten few raw fruits and
vegetables prior to developing the condition.
• Mainly eat nonacidic fresh or cooked vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, carrots,
celery, kale, garlic, and Brussels sprouts. Never fry anything.
• Avoid overeating, in order to reduce the inflammation of the GI wall.
• Gluten tends to make the problem worse. So avoid gluten-containing grains (which are
wheat, oats, rye, barley, and buckwheat). Remarkable results can be obtained, but the
gluten-free diet must be strictly adhered to; not even tiny amounts in the diet may be
permitted.
• Lactose intolerance is frequent. Avoid all milk products.
• Eliminate all possible food allergies and other allergies. Crohn's patients tend to have
allergic conditions, such as hay fever and eczema.
• Regularly obtain sunshine and fresh air.
• Avoid stress, anxiety, and worry. Keep calm and relaxed. Avoid even exciting,
competitive games.
• Charcoal will help control the diarrhea. Take 4-6 tablets, 2-3 times a day between meals.
If the charcoal irritates the colon, stir the charcoal into water, let the charcoal settle to the
bottom, and only drink the apparently clear top part.
• Make sure the bowels move daily.
• Surgary, antidiarrheal drugs, and corticosteroids should be avoided. They worsen the
condition rather than improving it. A full 50% of those who undergo surgery report a
rapid increase in symptoms afterward.
• Helpful herbs are black walnut, burdock, goldenseal, pau d'arco, psyllium, saffron, aloe
vera, fenugreek, slippery elm, and white oak bark.
—Also see ""Ulcerative Colitis.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—There is a mighty power in prayer. Our great adversary is constantly seeking
to keep us away from God. But the humblest soul can, through earnest prayer, penetrate the clouds and
lay hold on the arm of God in heaven.

(Regional Enteritis; Ulcerative Colitis)
SYMPTOMS—Loss of energy, appetite, and weight. Chronic diarrhea, fever, chronic rectal bleeding,
malabsorption, pain in the entire abdomen, excess fat in the stool (resulting in pale, bulky stools that
float). Malnutrition results.
CAUSES—Crohn's disease is also known as regional enteritis. Ulcerative colitis is a different disorder,
but similar enough in symptoms and treatment that we will list them together.
The difference is that ulcerative colitis only involves the first two layers of the intestinal wall (the
mucosa and submucosa); whereas Crohn's disease also affects the next two layers (the connective tissue
and the wall muscles).
Crohn's disease is a chronic ulceration of one or more sections of the digestive tract. Three special facts
are (1) the ulceration reaches into all layers of the gastro-intestinal (GI) wall, (2) the entire GI tract can
be involved, from mouth to the anus, and (3) this is usually a long-lasting condition.
As the inflamed portions heal, scar tissue remains, which keeps narrowing the channel.
Many puzzles still surround this condition. The origin is not clearly understood, and certain racial groups
contract it more than others (Jews have it more than anyone else).
But certain facts stand out:
Food food allergies may help it start, and identifying and avoiding them helps reduce it.
A lack of vitamins C and E in the diet aggravates the problem.
People in Europe and North America have it far more than those living elsewhere in the world.
Jews in America have it much more than Jews in Israel. Caucasians have it less often than Jews, but
more often than other races.
Therefore it is likely that the modern, Western, diet is a significant factor. Eating simple, nourishing
food is an important aspect of dealing with this problem.
Rarely does the disease strike once and go away. Most of the time it recurs for years. When this
happens, the ongoing scarring keeps reducing bowel functions.
If ignored, eventually Crohn's disease can lead to cancer.
No definite cure is known, but certain things tend to alleviate the problem.
It is believed that Crohn's disease is an autoimmune problem; that is, the GI tract has become so toxic
from years of mistreatment, that the immune system becomes confused and begins attacking the part of
the body housing the toxic food."
disease-general-diverticulitis,Diverticulitis,"TREATMENT
• In order to avoid the formation of those little pouches, always avoid constipation.
This is done by including enough roughage in your diet (fresh fruit and vegetables, bran,
and other sources of fiber), and by drinking enough water, etc. (See ""Constipation"" for
more information.) Psyllium seed and flaxseed also help soften the stools.
• Have a bowel movement when you sense you ought to. Do not wait.
• Obtain adequate exercise, especially out-of-doors.
• Prunes, pureed fruit juices, and herb teas are very helpful.
• Carrot, beet, celery, and green juices are excellent. Of the fruit juices, papaya, apple,
pineapple, and lemon are outstanding for your purposes.
• Chew nuts, seeds, and popcorn well, so they will be less likely to enter the diverticula.
• Eat smaller meals.
• Rats placed on high-fat diets, for 90 weeks, all developed colon diverticula.
• Avoid caffeine products. They all tend to irritate the colon.
• Do not eat a lot of sugar.
• Smoking and stress make the symptoms worse.
• Girdles, belts, and tight bands around the waist tend to increase abdominal pressure on
the colon.
• Helpful herbs include slippery elm, peppermint, chamomile, and aloe vera.
DURING AN ATTACK—As soon as an attack begins, give yourself a cleansing enema (2 quarts of
water and the juice of a fresh lemon). Take 4 charcoal tablets with a large glass of water.
In case of pain or spasm in the colon, apply a heating pad over the abdomen.
During the acute phase of an attack, it may be best to eat a low-fiber diet for a short time. Then return to
the high-fiber regime.
If the attack is severe, temporarily blend your food. Drink carrot, cabbage, and green juices.
To relieve pain, massage the abdomen on the left side. Stand up and stretch.
Try to have bowel movements on schedule. Take fiber first thing in the morning, and down a quart of
water before breakfast.
Check your stools daily. If they are black, this means blood is present; take a sample to a physician.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ's followers are to be more than a light in the midst of men. They are to
be the light of the world. God calls you to be His representative, to minister to the needs of those around
you. As you do this, your life will become marvelously fulfilled.
# ENEMA HABIT, TO OVERCOME
PROBLEM—Having taken enemas for a long time, you find you cannot have a bowel movement
without taking another.
SOLUTION—A small, cold enema is especially useful in retraining the colon to evacuate normally by
itself. Cold water has a bracing, strengthening, enlivening effect.
In hydrotherapy, the enema is considered cold if the temperature is 55-70o F.; whereas it is only cool if it
is 70-80o F. The cold enema is a powerful stimulant to bowel movements and should be more generally
used for this purpose instead of the warm enema. Use the cold enema to overcome both the enema habit
and the cathartic habit (always needing a laxative).
Obtain an ear irrigation syringe from the drugstore, and inject one syringeful of cold water into the
rectum. Hold it for one minute, and expel. A bowel movement will generally follow. Use this treatment
at the same time every day, to establish a pattern of regularity.
LAXATIVE AGENTS—Laxatives are supposed to promote bowel movements, but some only hinder
it.
Bran, psyllium, and raw fruits and vegetables are bulk-forming agents, and are not referred to as
""laxatives."" They are ideal ways to promote bowel movements, and are safe to use on a long-term basis.
Mineral oil and docusate sodium are stool softening agents. If used at all, they should only be used
temporarily. The mineral oil can damage the lungs, if inhaled, and absorbs fat-soluble vitamins in the
digestive tract. Docusate sodium increases toxicity of other drugs, and may cause liver damage.
Salts are osmotic agents, which draw water into the bowel for a flush. These are safe if used only
occasionally, but otherwise can initiate dependency. In addition, some people dare not take extra salts
into their body. Examples include milk of magnesia, Epsom salts, and table salt.
Stimulant agents cause a laxative effect by irritating the intestinal walls and induce peristalsis. But they
can result in dependency and can damage the bowels. Examples include various drugstore items; castor
oil; senna; and laxative herbs, such as cascara sagrada.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Friendship with God, what privilege can be greater? Study His Bible, pray
often, and tell others how wonderful He is. Tell them that God is love. This can give them the peace and
rest they so much want.

Anus
HEMORRHOIDS—1
(Piles)
SYMPTOMS—Burning, pain, itching, inflammation, swelling, irritation, seepage, and bleeding.
CAUSES—Hemorrhoids are enlarged varicose veins, found in the anus and rectum.
Those occurring below the internal sphincter (a circular muscle which closes the rectum) are called
external hemorrhoids. Those above that sphincter are called internal hemorrhoids.
Internal hemorrhoids are generally painless, but often bleed. When they do, the blood is bright red.
External hemorrhoids are also called piles. Sometimes they protrude from the anus. Because they
enlarge and lose their elasticity, they often form little sacs which protrude into the anal canal. The skin
above them turns blue or purple and can be extremely painful.
A prolapsed hemorrhoid is an internal one which is protruding outside the anus. Often there is a mucous
discharge and heavy bleeding. They can be very painful.
When they bleed, a fair amount of blood can issue forth. But it does not indicate a serious disease.
Older people are more likely to have them. Pregnant women, and women who have had children, tend to
have hemorrhoids more often than other younger people.
Circulatory weakness of the veins, along with constipation, are primary causes of hemorrhoids. Liver
congestion can also be a factor.
Any condition which increases pressure on that area or reduces the flow of blood through those veins
can induce hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids are common in folk who live on junk food diets, low-fiber diets, lack exercise, are sitting
while working (especially sitting when tense and nervous), do heavy lifting, are obese, pregnant,
straining at the stool, heavily coughing, frequently sneezing, have prolonged use of laxatives or enemas,
have elevated pressure on the portal vein of the liver (as occurs in cirrhosis of the liver), and sit on
something cold.
• To whatever degree you are able, take corrective actions as indicated in the above two
paragraphs.
• Avoid spicy, highly seasoned foods, for they irritate the inflamed area.
• Avoid sitting or standing for longer periods of time.
• If you must lift something, bend your knees and not your back. Do not hold your breath
as you lift. Instead, take a deep breath and exhale at the moment of lifting. Avoid heavy
lifting as much as possible.
• Do not sit on anything which does not warm up (a rock, steel, the ground) for periods of
time.
• Do not forget the high-fiber diet; it, and a proper diet, is crucial to success in avoiding or
managing this problem.
• Use soft toilet paper, and only dab with it. Use only non-perfumed, white toilet paper.
• Do not scratch the area.
• Diarrhea intensifies the problem, so avoid this. (See ""Diarrhea."") For the same reason,
avoid constipation (which see).
• Sitz (sitting) baths soothe inflamed tissues and relax spasms of the rectal and anal
muscles.
• Apply cold witch hazel tea , to help shrink them.
• In severe cases, take an alternating hot and cold sitz (sitting) bath. Use two large
galvanized wash tubs, propped up at one one end, to make sitting in them more
comfortable. Fold a large towel and place it in the bottom and sides, for comfort. Fill one
with hot water (100o F.), the other with tap water. Sit in the hot, for 5 minutes, and in the
cold, for 30 seconds. Spread the buttocks, as you do this, so the temperature changes will
have the best effect on the desired area. Do this 3 times. You can come back later and do it
again as needed.
• An alternate method, to use in less severe cases, is to sit in a bathtub of 10-12 inches of
hot water. Do this 3-5 times a day.
• Cranberry poultices are helpful. Blend a handful, wrap a tablespoonful in cloth, and lay
against the area. Change an hour later, and repeat when you wish.
• Dab lecithin on the area, as you would Vaseline.
• An ice pack to that area may also bring relief.
• Peel a garlic bulb and scrape it, to get the juice, to flow. Then insert it. It will be expelled
the next day during elimination. Do this 3 times a week.
• Cut a piece of aloe vera, about 2½ inches in length, peel, and insert.
• Applications of white oak bark tea or witch hazel will, through astringent action, tend to
shrink the hemorrhoids.
• Medicinal drugs generally contain local anesthetics, but these often irritate the area and
delay healing.
• A 1976 report stated that there was no evidence that any of the ingredients in
Preparation H could reduce inflammation or shrink hemorrhoids.
• Aspirin will intensify the bleeding.
• Prolapsed hemorrhoids can become thrombosed; that is, they can form clots inside them
which prevent their receding. Severe, increased pain indicates this has happened. Go to a
physician, to remove the clot. This is not the same as a hemorrhoidectomy, and is a
simple, rapid treatment.
• In case of persistent, severe problems, some may choose to have hemorrhoidectomy
done. Find a physician who has done this and adequately knows what to do.
A Personal testimony:
I have essentially been cured of my hemorrhoids with the following treatment;
I suffered with hemmorhoids for nearly 10 years, practically living on Preparation H,
and often in great pain. Again and again I had to have surgery for clots. This was
extremely unpleasant and painful, but the alternative was months of being almost unable
to walk at all.
On one occasion I developed four clots, and an extremely painful flareup. I was out of
all medication for the pain, and was desparate. I looked around for anything that might
help.
I had on hand a solution that we had used on animals for skin problems. It consisted of
9 parts colloidal silver (liquid, electrically made), and 1 part DMSO. I knew that the
DMSO had pain-relieving properties, and decided to try in on my hemmorhoids, which I
did.
The pain relief was not spectacular, but it did help some. So every 20 to 30 minutes
when the pain got bad, I applied it again. After a day or so, I noticed that the pain was
definitely getting better, and I had to apply the mixture less frequently.
It was really helping, so over the next few days and weeks I continued the treatment, and
the pattern continued of needing the application less and less often. In amazement I
realized that the clots were actually dissolving! Nothing but surgery had ever gotten rid of
them before! And, in time, all the swelling went away.
It has been years since this occurred. Once in a while I will have a twinge of pain, and
will apply the solution again. But one application is usually sufficient to remove all
symptoms. For months at a time I have absolutely no symptoms at all.
If you have further questions about how I applied this remarkable remedy, you can
contact me at jeannie@ucinet.com.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Bible religion is to be interwoven into everything we do and say. Let others
see Jesus in you. Make His honor first. Show others that the Ten Commandments are the best commands
to be kept in the whole world.
HEMORRHOIDS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
PORTAL CONGESTION—Cold Foot Bath, in running water; Hot Foot Bath or Hot Foot and Leg
Bath; Hot Leg Pack; Revulsive Douche to feet and legs; Hot Abdominal Pack.
IRREDUCIBLE PROLAPSE—Rest in bed; lying on the face; knee-chest position, if required. Ice
Compress; bathing parts with ice water; daily small Cold Enema after stool. Relive bowels while lying
in horizontal position; avoid straining; Need abdominal supporter. In many cases, surgical measures are
necessary.
INFLAMED HEMORRHOIDS—Rest in bed with feet and hips elevated; knee-chest position, if
necessary; Ice Cold Compress, pressed firmly against anus; ice suppositories (ice placed in rectum); very
shallow Ice cold Sitz Bath.
PAIN—If due to inflammation, short hot Fomentation followed by cold compress applied to the anus
and nates, with Hot Foot Bath at the same time; repeat Fomentation hourly or every 2 hours; Prolonged
tepid Sitz Bath, at 850-800 F.; Hot Hip and Leg Pack, followed by Cold Compress over nates, perineum,
and lower back.
—Also see ""Hemorrhoids—1.""

SYMPTOMS—No symptoms until they become infected or inflamed, resulting in chills, fever, and
pain. The pain may be localized in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and may be constant.
Sometimes there is a brief period of diarrhea.
CAUSES—Diverticula are small pouch-like sacs on the inside of the large bowel, generally in the
descending colon. When a person is constipated, he tends to push too hard. The air pressure exerted by
this muscular squeeze on the bowel muscles can force small pockets to form in the walls of the lower
colon.
Once they form, diverticula never go away. Of themselves, they provide no symptoms. The problem is
that fecal matter can collect in them and eventually attract bacteria. This results in infection or
inflammation, which produces the fever, chills, and pain.
Diverticulosis is when you have diverticula. It is basically symptomless. Diverticulitis is when they are
inflamed or infected; then the unfortunate symptoms reveal themselves.
This is another disease caused by ""civilized"" refined and junk foods. It is practically unknown in Third
World nations, and was almost totally unknown before our century.
More than half of those over 60 in America have this problem."
disease-general-rectal-fissures,Rectal Fissures,"TREATMENT
• Avoid constipation. Be sure and include enough fiber in the diet and drink enough water
each day. The two, combined, will produce soft stools. Eat more fruits and vegetables, and
drink 6-8 glasses of water daily.
• Do not scratch the area. Wipe yourself gently.
• Avoid diarrhea. An ongoing case of it can soften rectal tissue, so it is more likely to tear.
• Sit on something soft. A special pillow can be purchased in the drugstore.
• Fairly hot water on the area will relax and sooth it.
• If needed, place corn starch on the area after each bath, to keep it dry. Do not use talcum
powder for this—or anything else. It can cause cancer. Talcum powder is rock dust.
• These swellings may be opened with a blade or by soaking it in hot sitz baths of 3%
boric acid. A poultice of echinacea may be applied directly to the abscess, to disinfect and
help bring it to a pointed shape, so it can be opened. Flush the opened abscess with 3%
hydrogen peroxide, to clean it out and disinfect the wound.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If Christ is dwelling in the heart, it is impossible to conceal the light of His
presence. Let Him use you to be the blessing to others, which they so much need.

(Rectal Abscesses)
SYMPTOMS—After passing a larger-diameter bowel movement, there is burning, stinging, and
possible bleeding on the rectum. Painful red swelling at, or near, the anal opening.
CAUSES—Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum area. Fissures are ulcers or breaks in
the skin which just happen to occur in the same area.
The margins where skin meets the mucous membrane can have small tears. This occurs sometimes at the
corners of the mouth. Fissures on the rectum are somewhat similar.
A common cause is the passing of a large, hard stool."
disease-general-rectal-itching,Rectal Itching,"TREATMENT
• Take pulse tests to determine food allergies. (See ""Pulse Test."")
• Several foods have been found to cause allergies, leading to itching: beer, wine, hard
liquor, coffee, milk, cola drinks, tea, citrus, chocolate, tomatoes, popcorn, nuts, and spicy
food.
• Avoid gas-forming foods.
• Take vitamin A and flaxseed oil orally.
• Avoid stressful situations. High-strung individuals tend to have this problem more than
others. Their nerves are on edge.
• Use wet tissue to clean the area after a bowel movement, but do not leave the area wet.
• Eliminating moisture from the area is a key factor. Moisture, leakage, and fecal soiling
are frequently primary causes.
• Do not use anesthetic medications with ""caine"" in the name. They produce strong
allergic reactions, making the condition worse. They also tend to keep moisture on the
area.
• Avoid using soap in the area, for soap is highly alkaline.
• After a bowel movement, it will help to wash the area with a syringe of water. Dry
thoroughly afterward.
• Take a hot sitz bath daily. After the bath, apply lemon juice to the area with a piece of
cotton. Or rub wheat germ oil on all affected parts after washing and drying well.
• A warm (not hot) tea bag of goldenseal may be applied to the area for up to a half hour,
to relieve itching.
• Avoid tight clothing of any type in the abdominal area.
• Avoid drugs; many irritate the colon, leading to pruritus.
—Also see pinworms under ""Worms.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Resolve that, not in your own strength, but in the strength and grace given of
God, that you will consecrate to Him now, just now, every power and ability of your life.

Digestive

(Pruritis Ani, Anus Itch)
SYMPTOMS—Itching around the anus.
CAUSES—Causes include infection, parasites, poor hygiene, diabetes, estrogen deficiency, or liver
disease. Skin diseases, such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and eczema can also cause it. Another
possible cause is contact dermatitis, due to perfumed or dyed toilet tissue, deodorants, soap, or
underclothing. Food allergies are thought to be another cause.
Rectal itching is a symptom of a problem rather than a disease. Resolving the basic problem is essential
to eliminating the itching.
Pinworms are frequently the cause in children, but rarely in adults. (See pinworms in ""Worms."")"
disease-general-anorexia-nervosa,Anorexia Nervosa,"TREATMENT
• Pray with the person and help her find peace in God. We must accept ourselves,
physically, as we are, and go on from there.
• Perk up the appetite. Give betaine hydrochloride and pancreatic enzymes.
• Give herbs which help stimulate the appetite: sweet flag, calamus, yellow gentian,
buckbean, or marsh trefoil. Give herbs before meals.
• A good nutritional program, along with vitamin/mineral supplementation, is vitally
needed. The delicate problem is getting the individual to eat enough food, so that normal
balances can be regained.
—Also see ""Bulimia.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—No one can remain neutral in the conflict. Everyone must decide whether he
will stand under the banner of Satan or the ensign of Christ. Every day we are deciding where we will
stand in this battle. ""Choose you this day whom you will serve.""

SYMPTOMS—Thin people who try to keep losing more weight.
CAUSES—Both Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are obsessive eating disorders, but they are not the
same.
Anorexia describes people who, although thin and often weak, are certain that they need to lose more
weight. They fear food and weight gain, and will hardly eat.
Bulimia describes people who try to eat less, then go on eating binges because they feel starved. Each
one is concluded by purging (induced vomiting) in order to bring up the food eaten. (See ""Bulimia."")
Believing they are overweight, fearful of gaining more, these individuals rather consistently try to keep
themselves starved. They tend to have low self-esteem, and often are depressed. Certain that they look
terrible, and sure that eating still less might solve the problem, these folk have a thinking pattern which
is difficult to change.
In some cases, drug and/or alcohol abuse is also involved.
Lack of proper nutrition tends to intensify the feelings and attitudes.
Almost all anorexics are women, typically between the ages of 12 to 18.
The word, ""anorexia,"" means ""appetite loss,"" and technically could apply to anyone who has an ongoing
disinclination to eat food. This can be caused by stress, malnutrition, shock, or injury. But, today, the
term is generally applied only to those who have anorexia nervosa. This article only applies to this latter
definition.
Some consider anorexia nervosa to be a psychiatric illness. Others believe that reaction to a strong,
underlying collection of allergenic foods is the problem. The often repeated phrase, ""I always feel better
when I don't eat, and feel bad when I do,"" can apply to both viewpoints.
About a third of those with this problem prematurely die from starvation, infections, heart disorders, or
suicide.
The underlying cause must be dealt with. Love and understanding is needed. Help from someone outside
the family may be needed. However, there is danger in consulting professional counselors or
psychologists, since they have been trained in hypnotic procedures; a growing number of instances are
occurring where so-called ""repressed memories"" are implanted in the counselee. —And that only adds to
the problems!"
disease-general-bulimia,Bulimia,"TREATMENT
• Follow the suggestions for anorexia (which see).
• Do not eat any sugar or sugary foods. Avoid all junk food and white flour products. A
simple, nourishing diet is urgently needed in order to restore the needed balance in life.
• The person should expect to experience temporary anxiety, depression, insomnia, and
possible irritation, as he attempts to break with the old way of life. But the rewards are
outstanding and well- worth the effort.
• CCK (cholecystokinin-pancreozymin) is a hormone, found in the small intestine and
brain which signals a satisfied feeling and that it is time to stop eating. When a person gets
into a pattern of overeating, that hormone is not properly produced. So the person only
feels satisfied after heavily overeating a meal.
• The only solution is to rigorously eat just so much, even though it does not seem like
enough. Eventually, the hormone will start being produced again in the proper amount at
the proper time.
—Also see ""Anorexia nervosa.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—For Christ's sake, we are to endure trials. We are not engaged in mimic battles.
Satan wants to have you. But, pleading with God for help, you can choose to cast in your lot with Christ.
And you will have angels to help you win the battle.

SYMPTOMS—The people appear normal, and the symptoms occur in secret.
CAUSES—Bulimia describes people who try to eat less to keep their weight down; then, every so often,
they go on a eating binge. This is followed by purging (induced vomiting) or the taking of laxatives, so
the food will be eliminated without being properly digested. (Also see ""Anorexia nervosa."")
Bulimia can result in serious physical problems, including hypoglycemia, internal bleeding, ulcers,
erratic heartbeat, kidney damage, menstrual cessation, low pulse rate and blood pressure, and glandular
damage.
Some bulimiacs overdo on exercise, in order to better manage weight and somehow improve an already
unbalanced situation.
Professions requiring a beautiful appearance are where we are most likely to find bulimiacs (models,
actors, dancers, ballet dancers). By her own admission, Princess Diane is a bulimiac. Thinness is equated
with beauty by many people.
Oddly enough, while anorexics tend to be overly thin, bulimiacs are generally just right; not too heavy or
too thin.
But their way of life may produce hair loss, yellow skin, premature wrinkles, muscle fatigue, dizziness,
and extreme weakness.
The primary physical signs are those which are caused by sessions of induced vomiting: swollen salivary
glands, constant sore throat, hiatal hernia, esophageal inflammation, erosion of the enamel of the back
teeth, swollen glands in the face and neck, and broken blood vessels in the face.
If laxative abuse is done, then rectal bleeding, bowel damage, and chronic diarrhea may result.
Excessive laxative use removes an excess of potassium and sodium, leading to muscle spasms,
dehydration, and eventual cardiac arrest.
Bulimiacs tend to have low levels of serotonin, which can lead to increased cravings for simple
carbohydrates (sugars). Yet it is likely that the binges produced those chronically low levels."
disease-general-celiac-disease,Celiac Disease,"TREATMENT
• You will want to avoid the gluten foods, which are wheat, oats, rye, and barley.
• The follow grains do not have gluten: corn, millet, and rice. Soybeans, quince, and
amaranth are also okay. Buckwheat is okay for some celiacs, but not for others.
• All grains fed to babies (and adults too) should be cooked for 2-3 hours, if the
preparation is done by boiling at 212o F.
• Do not eat products containing cow's milk. Breast-feed the child, to avoid using cow's
milk.
• Do not overeat sugar or white-flour products.
• Eat a nourishing diet, including fresh fruit and vegetables, and vegetable juices. Fiber is
important in the diet of celiacs.
• Allisatin, found in garlic, is said to help treat celiac disease.
• Ripe bananas are tolerated well, and help control the diarrhea.
• Avoid processed, fried, and junk food. Do not eat sugary foods, chocolate, and processed
foods.
• Read the labels, and watch for ""hidden"" gluten or cow's milk ingredients in bottles and
packages. Some of these are malt, modified food starch, some soy sauces, garin vinegars,
binders, fillers, excipients, and ""natural flavorings."" Almost all commercial breads, bread
mixes, crackers, etc., contain gluten. It is often found in commercially prepared puddings,
candies, cookies, cakes, ice cream, salad dressings, luncheon meats, frankfurters, canned
chili, macaroni, noodles, spaghetti, bread stuffings, and anything thickened with flour
(soups, vegetables, bottled meat sauces, gravies, flavoring syrups, sauces, cocoa mixes.
• Only eat homemade desserts.
• Frozen, fresh, or canned vegetable and vegetable juices are all right.
• Breads and cereals made from rice, millet, soybean, corn, or potato starch are okay.
• Do not eat meat.
• Avoid tobacco, tea, coffee, and alcohol.
• Helpful herbs include aloe vera, burdock, pau d'arco, psyllium, saffron, slippery elm, and
alfalfa.
—Also see ""Lactose Intolerance."" Both have some similar symptoms and problems. Also see ""Crohn's
Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—You may at times hesitate. Should you choose the right? But the command of
God is ""Go forward!"" Do what is right, regardless of the consequences, and the angels of God will be by
your side.

(Celiac Sprue, Gluten Intolerance)
SYMPTOMS—Diarrhea, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies such as anemia. Other symptoms
include frequently pale and/or light-yellow, foul-smelling stools that float; fatigue; depression;
abdominal swelling; muscle cramps; wasting; and bone and/or joint pain. Diarrhea is the most
commonly observed symptom.
Infants and children may show vomiting; stunted growth; intense burning sensation of the skin; and a
red, itchy skin rash. Ulcers may develop in the mouth. The child may look anemic and undernourished.
Babies may lose weight or gain it more slowly, and do not seem to be thriving well. The disease can
begin in the first few months of life.
CAUSES—Celiac disease affects the small intestine. There are abnormalities in the intestinal lining, due
to a permanent intolerance to gluten. Gluten is in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. (Corn, rice, millet,
soybeans, quinoa, and amaranth do not contain gluten. There seems to be a little uncertainty about
buckwheat.) The protein, gliaden, is thought to be the toxic part of the gluten. It interacts with the lining
of the intestines, causing the tiny absorptive fingers which jut from it (the villi) to flatten and atrophy.
As a result, nutrients are not absorbed (including vitamins A, D, and K) and the disease symptoms
appear.
Unfortunately, many physicians and the food industries recommend that grains be introduced into the
diet of the infant when they are less than a year old. This can prompt celiac disease to first appear then
or even decades later.
This is important! Tell every expectant mother not to feed her child grains until it is at least a year old.
Removing gluten from the diet of a celiac produces a marked change; whether an infant, child, or adult,
the person starts feeling better again. But he must not return to gluten foods.
Some infants do not tolerate cow's milk protein, and react to it with celiac symptoms, even before gluten
is given to them. So remove that also from them.
Celiac disease is often misdiagnosed as spastic colon, irritable bowel syndrome, or something else which
affects the intestines.
Yet, if left untreated, celiac disease can be quite serious. It can lead to pancreatic disease, infertility,
miscarriages, internal hemorrhaging, bone disease, gynecological disorders, nervous system damage,
intestinal lymphoma, and many more. For example, anemia is common, due to poor absorption of folic
acid, iron, and vitamins B and K.
12
Scarring of the intestinal lining can progress so far that, by the age of 45 to 50, 90% of the intestine can
be damaged, resulting in a significant reduction (as much as 70%) of the absorptive surfaces.
But there is evidence that partial repair to those walls can be made within several months, if you
permanently part company with the offending foods."
disease-general-lactose-intolerance,Lactose Intolerance,"TREATMENT
• Avoid all milk and dairy products. This includes ice cream.
• Beware of products which contain small amounts of added milk ingredients, such as
""milk solids."" Lactose is added to many processed foods, including cookies, pancake
mixes, breads, canned and powdered soups, flavored coffees, powdered drink mixes, and
processed meats.
• Since you cannot drink milk, eat foods which are rich in calcium. This includes broccoli,
dried figs, apricots, blackstrap molasses, and other vegetable greens.
• Do not eat spinach or rhubarb, for they contain a chemical which blocks absorption of
calcium.
• Take supplemental calcium gluconate (or calcium lactate) powder. This is an excellent
source of nutritional calcium.
• Many pharmaceutical drugs contain lactose as a filler.
• Do not eat any solid food during a lactose attack of diarrhea. Just drink lots of good
water and replace lost minerals.
• Acidophilus milk would not help the person with lactose intolerance, for the acidophilus
works to improve conditions in the colon, and the problems with lactose occur in the small
intestine.
—Also see ""Celiac Disease."" Both have some similar symptoms and problems.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The victory can be gained, for nothing is impossible with God. Give Him your
heart, and you have given Him the best gift you can. And is it not worth it? He offers you Christ and
eternal life in heaven.

SYMPTOMS—Diarrhea, gas, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms generally begin 30 minutes to 2 hours
after eating dairy products.
In infants, symptoms include foamy diarrhea with diaper rash, slow weight gain and development, as
well as vomiting.
CAUSES—Lactose intolerance is inability to digest milk sugar. The intestinal wall is not able to make
the digestive enzyme, lactase, which is needed to split lactose into glucose and galactose. When the
lactose is not split, it remains undigested in the intestinal tract; retains fluid; and ferments in the colon,
producing gas, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.
Although it can cause digestive disruption and discomfort, lactose intolerance will not produce
dangerous results, and can be easily controlled through careful diet.
Oddly enough, hardly any adults in the world can digest milk sugar after the age of 20. The exceptions
are most Caucasians of northern European origin.
The following infections can result in lactose intolerance: irritable bowel syndrome, regional enteritis,
and ulcerative colitis.
Although less common, in infants and children it can occur after a severe attack of gastroenteritis, which
injures the intestinal wall.
If you are pregnant and there is lactose intolerance in your family, plan to breast-feed your child or give
him a non-dairy formula (such as soy milk). But, if you do, give him added calcium gluconate powder,
since soy milk does not contain enough calcium.
Lactose intolerance is different than milk allergy. A person with lactose intolerance cannot digest milk
sugar; one with milk allergy can digest milk, but his immune system is antagonistic to one or more of its
components."
disease-general-wilson-s-disease,Wilson'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• A lifetime must be spent avoiding things which have copper and taking substances
which remove it from the body.
• Check your drinking water, to make sure it has no copper. If it has more than 1 part per
million of copper, drink bottled water.
• Make sure your vitamin/mineral supplements do not include copper.
• Onions and garlic contain sulfur, which helps rid the body of copper. But do not take
flowers of sulfur (the chemical sulfur); they will give you boils.
• Eliminate from the diet those foods which are high in copper. This includes chocolate,
molasses, nuts, organ meats, shellfish, broccoli, mushrooms, avocados, legumes, oats, egg
yolks, soybeans, raisins, and whole grains.
• Maintain a high intake of vitamin C and zinc, since copper in the body tends to destroy
both.
• Avoid exposure to metal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The true man or woman is the one who will stand by principle, even though
all others may be compromising. Obedience to the commandments of God, by enabling faith in Christ, is
what is needed.

Nutritional

SYMPTOMS—The fissure sign is a pigmented ring (the Kayser-Fleischer ring) at the outer margin of
the cornea of the eye.
Later symptoms include bloody vomit; drooling; an enlarged spleen; jaundice; difficulty in speaking,
swallowing, and/or walking; loss of coordination; progressive fatigue, weakness, intellectual
impairment; personality changes; bizarre behavior; spasms, tremors, rigidity of the muscles; fluid
accumulation; swelling in the abdomen; and weight loss.
Although the disease begins at birth, symptoms generally do not appear until the age of six or more often
in the teens or later.
CAUSES—Wilson's disease is rare and inherited. The body is not able to metabolize the trace mineral
copper, although it is still absorbed by the small intestine into the blood stream.
The result is an excess of copper in the various organs (liver, kidneys, brain, and corneas of the eyes). If
not cared for, Wilson's disease will result in serious damage to the liver and brain, and, ultimately, death.
Early detection and treatment can minimize the damage. If you have a family history of this disease,
have diagnostic tests made of you and your children. Early detection is important. The following is a
treatment for one with this disease; it should not be used by those who do not have Wilson's disease:"

Compress during intervals.
INTESTINAL CATARRH—Enema at 950 F. after each bowel movement. During the interval
between, apply a Heating Compress at 600 F., changing it every 30 minutes.
HYPOPEPSIA—Graduated tonic treatment (Tonic Frictions), Ice Bag over stomach half an hour before
each meal.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid prolonged Hot Baths and Cold Full Baths.
GENERAL METHOD—The general plan of treatment must be such as to secure increased income of
tissue-building material with a diminished outflow, hence the diet must be very simple, easily
assimilable, and taken in as large a quantity as possible. Exercise must be diminished or, in grave cases,
suspended altogether. Moderate exercise may be allowed, if necessary, to maintain the appetite. Special
attention must be given to increase of the appetite and improvement of digestion by suitable
hydrotherapy applications. Cold applications must be very short and intense, so as to produce strong
nervous impressions upon the nerve centers without removing animal heat, to any considerable degree,
or increasing oxidation."
disease-general-pica,Pica,"(craves dirt)
SYMPTOMS—The child keeps eating dirt.
CAUSES—Children eat dirt because they crave minerals which they are not obtaining enough of in the
foods served them. Sometimes they eat paint chips from the walls. But paint often contains lead or
cadmium, both of which are quite toxic. Lead can produce brain damage. (See ""Lead Poisoning."")
TREATMENT—Supplement the child's diet with extra vitamins and minerals.
• Include Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp in his diet. This will supply trace minerals.
If you live near the ocean, add a little ocean water to help salt the food. Do pulse tests to
determine if a celiac type of disease exists (see ""Pulse Test,"" and ""Celiac Disease"").
• Do a hair analysis test, to determine which minerals are needed.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The temptations of Satan are greater now than ever before; for he knows that
his time is short, and that very soon every case will be decided, either for life or for death. It is no time
to sink beneath discouragement or give up the battle. Cling to Jesus and, by His grace, live the life of an
overcomer."
disease-general-malabsorption-syndrome,Malabsorption Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• The great need is to cleanse the body, and then rebuild it with a good, healthy program.
• A good nourishing diet, as discussed elsewhere in this book; rest; exercise out-of-doors;
fresh air; sunlight; freedom from worry and tension—all these are needed.
• Oregon grape and gentian are healing and improve digestion. Chamomile calms the
nervous stomach. Peppermint and parsley are also healing.
• Make sure the bowels are kept open and working properly. This reduces toxins in the
intestinal tract and digestive organs.
• Locate specific causes and problems and apply solutions, as given elsewhere in this
book.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God is love and He cares for us. ""Like as a father pitieth his children, so the
Lord pitieth them that fear Him."" Trust and obey your sweet heavenly Father. You will never be sorry
that you did.

SYMPTOMS—Anemia, diarrhea, and weight loss are frequent. Sometimes there is weight gain instead
of weight loss.
Other symptoms may include dry skin, fatigue, abdominal bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, PMS,
thinning hair, tendency to bruise easily, depression, or inability to concentrate. There may also be vision
problems (especially night vision; and bulky, pale, and fatty stools (known as steatorrhea).
CAUSES—This appears to be a wastebasket category. Whenever nutrients, in general, cannot be
properly absorbed by the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, the problem is dubbed ""malabsorption syndrome.""
Possible causes include an impoverished diet, primarily junk food. The body may not be producing
enough digestive enzymes. Vitamin B complex may not be in the diet or is not being absorbed properly.
Diseases of the gallbladder, liver and bile ducts, or pancreas may exist. There may be food allergies.
Other causes include damaged intestinal walls, caused by irritable bowel syndrome; lactose intolerance;
Crohn's disease; diverticulitis; celiac disease; colitis; parasitic infestation; excessive consumption of
antacids, alcohol, or laxatives. Chronic constipation or diarrhea can have a similar result.
Radiation therapy, sugary foods that shorten the intestinal tract, or digitalis treatment can reduce the
absorptive area of the intestines. An overgrowth of candida in the digestive tract or obstructions in the
lymphatic system can have a similar effect.
Too rapid intestinal transit time causes nutrients to pass out of the body as waste.
AIDS and cancer can produce many of these symptoms.
There are a number of other possible causes, including a variety of drug medications.
Premature aging can be caused by a decline in secretions of stomach acid and digestive enzymes."
disease-general-beriberi,Beriberi,"TREATMENT
• Eat brown rice, raw fruits and vegetables, seeds, nuts, legumes, and whole grains.
• Take vitamin/mineral supplements.
• Do not drink liquids with your meals, for this washes away water-soluble vitamins.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All who give themselves to the service of Christ will follow the example of
Christ, and will be perfect overcomers. In His strength, you can stand firm amid the pollutions of this
degenerate age.

(B Vitamin Deficiency)
SYMPTOMS—In children: mental confusion, muscle wasting, impaired growth, convulsions, nausea,
vomiting, stomach and intestinal problems, diarrhea, and constipation.
In adults: weight loss, diarrhea, edema, fatigue.
CAUSES—Beriberi is a nutritional disease, caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B ), but also all
1
the other B complex vitamins, as well.
Beriberi is not common in the West. In the East, where many subsist primarily on polished (hulled) rice,
it is endemic. The rice bran contains the vitamins, and the polished kernel only contains starch and
protein.
In America, beriberi occurs as a result of alcoholism, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, infections, or stress."
disease-general-pellagra,Pellagra,"TREATMENT
• Eat plenty of foods high in the B vitamins and take nutritional supplements.
• Worthwhile foods would include potatoes, legumes, broccoli, collards, bananas, figs,
nuts, seeds, peanut butter, tomatoes, prunes, and whole grain breads and cereals.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All power to do good is God-given. His grace is sufficient for all our trials. If
we trust wholly in God, we can overcome every temptation and, through His grace, come off victorious.

(B Vitamin Deficiency)
SYMPTOMS—Depression, anxiety, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea, loss of appetite, red tongue that is
sore and inflamed, weakness, weight loss, dementia, and itchy skin on the hands and neck.
It is sometimes diagnosed as mental illness.
CAUSES—Pellagra is a deficiency disease, caused by a severe lack of several vitamins. It is rare in the
United States at this time; but, when it does occur, it is caused by diseases which heavily deplete those
vitamins.
The primary vitamins involved are niacin (vitamin B ) and, secondarily, thiamine (B ) and riboflavin
3 1
(B ). Also needed is folic acid and vitamin B .
2 12"
disease-general-scurvy,Scurvy,"TREATMENT
• Scurvy responds, in as little as 2-3 days, to a daily intake of 100-200 mg of vitamin C.
• Fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables are also full of vitamin C.
• In order to promote blood and bone repair, from damage caused by scurvy, a well-
balanced diet, high in protein and iron, is also needed.
• Supply bioflavonoids (vitamin P), which work closely with vitamin C. These will be
found in vitamin C-rich foods.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize
with Him in prayer. He will not turn us away empty, but will give us grace and strength to overcome and
break the power of the enemy.

(Vitamin C Deficiency)
SYMPTOMS—Swelling and bleeding of the gums, tenderness of joints and muscles, poor healing of
wounds, and increased susceptibility to bruising and infection. Rough, dry, discolored skin. Scurvy may
occur concurrently with gingivitis (which see).
An infant with scurvy is comfortable only when lying on his back with his knees partially bent and his
thighs turned outward. His bones are less capable of retaining calcium and phosphorous, causing them to
become weak and eventually brittle.
CAUSES—Scurvy is a malnutrition disease, caused by a diet that is deficient in vitamin C."
disease-general-kwashiorkor,Kwashiorkor,"TREATMENT
• Add protein to the diet. In underdeveloped countries, a skim milk formula is usually first
given, because the child's fat-absorption ability has been damaged.
• Other foods are gradually added, until he can handle a balanced diet.
• Correct all vitamin/mineral deficiencies which may exist.
ENCOURAGEMENT—To obey the commandments of God is the only way to obtain His favor. ""Go
forward"" should be the Christian's watchword. Let God lead you by His Written Word, and you will not
take missteps.
Section 5
Gastro-Intestinal
Part 13
Weight
OVERWEIGHT—1
(Obesity)
SYMPTOMS—The person is heavier by about 20% than the average for his height and weight.
CAUSES—Obesity is an excess of body fat; too much is being stored. It is also consuming more
calories than you can use. All it takes is for you to be 20% overweight in order to be classified as obese.
The average human body has 30-40 million fat cells. That is too many for some of us. It has been said
that when a person makes an extra fat cell, in order to store some extra fat, he keeps that cell for the rest
of his life—even though he may remove the fat from it.
Poor diet, fatty foods, and a lack of exercise are common causes of overweight. Other factors include
diabetes, hypoglycemia, endocrine glands which do not function properly, boredom, tension, and love of
food. Another factor is inadequate intake or absorption of key nutrients, which causes fat to be stored
instead of used.
Over $30 billion is spent each year, in America, on foods or equipment to help lose weight.
Obesity can be involved with hormonal imbalances in the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, thyroid,
adrenals, or pancreas.
Obese people tend to store fat, not only in regular fat cells, but also in muscle tissue. Then, when they
try to lose weight (via a weight loss diet), they lose both fat from the fat cells and protein from the
muscles—before they lose fat from the muscles. The best solution is to keep fit, so you do not store fat
in your muscle tissue.
To maintain weight loss (that is, an ongoing program of losing a little weight), calculate how many
calories you need each day. Multiply your weight by 10. Then add 30% (about a third) to the total.
Assuming that you are moderately active, eating anything less than that total amount should cause you to
lose weight. This total is the amount of calories you can consume daily, without gaining the weight back
which you have already lost.
It is said that 90% of obese people overeat and binge because their empty calorie diets do not supply
enough minerals (especially trace minerals) and vitamins.
TREATMENT—People try to cut down on the calories, when they should make sure they steadily
obtain good basic nutrition. Without adequate nourishment, they will generally binge or go off their
special diets. It is now known that steady eating is better than losing weight, gaining it, losing it, and
gaining it. The up and down program damages the body, and makes it more susceptible to disease. The
14-year Framingham Study established that repeated crash diets increases the risk of heart disease.
• Test for food allergies (see Pulse Test) and eliminate them.
• Consistently eat a lighter, but more nourishing, diet. Do not eat food for fun; eat for
health and to stay well.
• Avoid junk food, fatty food, fried food, processed food, caffeine, nicotine, and soft
drinks,
• Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day.
• Do not skip meals. Make breakfast the largest, lunch a moderate meal, and supper the
lightest.
• Include Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp in your diet, to supply trace minerals.
• When you end a meal, make it a habit to eat nothing more until your next meal.
• Include a good vitamin-mineral supplement and fiber.
• Go on a good basic diet and stay on it. Here is an example of one:
• Eat moderate amounts of raw citrus and subacid fruits, but no sweet fruits, such as
grapes or dried fruits. No fruit juices, except diluted grape juice taken a half hour before
the meal, to reduce appetite. No bananas.
• Eat as much raw vegetables as you want.
• The only cooked vegetables should be fresh and conservatively cooked ones. Do not use
frozen, fried, or canned vegetables.
• Primarily eat vegetarian protein foods, and in some moderation: beans, sprouted beans,
seeds, nuts, etc.
• All refined carbohydrates are forbidden. This includes sugar, alcohol, white-flour
products, quick oats, most packaged cereals, and processed starch.
• Eat only well-cooked, unrefined brown rice, barley, rye, millet, buckwheat, wheat
berries, bulgur, corn, and other whole grains. Do not grind them, but cook and eat them in
their natural state.
• Use cold-pressed unsaturated oils, plus lemon juice, and possibly some herbs for
flavoring.
• Do not overeat, ever. It is a very, very bad habit to get into; it is a habit which can be
stopped.
• Do not eat between meals; that is another habit to quit.
• When eating, concentrate on quietly eating and thinking about when you should stop. Do
not just relax, talk, socialize, and eat and eat. Do not listen to the radio, read a book, or
watch television. Stick to your work of eating lightly of nourishing food, and quit when
you should.
• You will not be harmed by finishing the meal a little hungry.
• A regular exercise program is needed.
Here are still more helpful ideas:
• Aerobic exercises are better than other kinds. This simply means exercise done out in the
open air. It helps lose weight; build strength; strengthen the heart, arteries, and veins; and
invigorate the vital organs and endocrine glands.
• Walking uses up to 120 calories per hour while actual jogging burns only 440 calories
per hour. Walking is always the best exercise.
• Swimming is usually done in cold water, and this triggers the body to store extra fat as
protection against the cold. So swimming does not help one lose weight.
• Children who are overweight by the age of 2 turn into fat adults more frequently than
others. Do not overfeed them with an excess of starches and cow's milk. Most infants
receive starches by four months, but that is far too early and only leads to later allergies or
celiac disease (which see).
• If you are only moderately overweight, do not worry about the comments of your thin
friends; they probably wish they could gain a little.
—Also see ""Overweight—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Victories are not gained by ceremonies or display, but by simple obedience to
the highest General, the Lord God of heaven. He who trusts in this Leader will never know defeat.
OVERWEIGHT—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
INCREASE OXIDATION OF HYDROCARBONS—Moderately prolonged cold baths, especially
Wet Sheet Pack, Shallow Bath, Cold Shower; Dripping Sheet Rub; Shallow Bath; Plunge Bath;
moderate exercise several times daily. The Cold Bath may be advantageously preceded by the Radiant
Heat Bath or some other form of sweating bath that is not too prolonged. Exercise should always be
preceded by a cold bath of sufficient duration to lower the temperature a few tenths of a degree.
CARDIAC WEAKNESS—Cold Compress over the heart (except in fatty degeneration of the heart) 15-
30 minutes, 3 times daily; graduated exercises out-of-doors when possible.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid prolonged Hot Baths unless immediately followed by a cold bath.
GENERAL METHOD—The general plan of treatment must be prolonged cold baths and vigorous
exercise while reducing the daily ration of food to the lowest point consistent with the maintenance of
his strength. The treatment must never be conducted in such a way as to diminish his muscular or
nervous energy. If he complains of feeling weak or debilitated, the vigor of the treatment must be
diminished. There should be a steady gain in muscular strength accompanying the loss of flesh. His
strength should be tested weekly. Do not use Hot Baths, for they are especially debilitating.
—Also see ""Overweight—1.""

(Protein Starvation)
SYMPTOMS—Retarded growth, changes in skin and hair, diarrhea, loss of appetite, edema, and
nervous irritability.
CAUSES—Kwashiorkor (kwash-uh-OR'-kor) is a serious nutritional disease. Adequate carbohydrates
are provided, but not enough protein.
This condition generally occurs in children between the ages of one and five, who have been weaned
from milk to a diet primarily of starches and sugars.
Low blood protein levels cannot hold water in the blood vessels so it goes into the cells, producing a
distended, bloated belly and edema.
There are 22 amino acids which children need, and 20 which adults need. Complete protein meals
should be the objective."
disease-general-underweight,Underweight,"TREATMENT
Your body is having a hard time meeting the challenges of life, and needs help. The recommendations
are simple enough:
• Eat a nourishing diet, such as is outlined repeatedly in this book. For some people, it
should include more calories and protein than should normally be eaten. But for many
who are habitually underweight, the solution is to continue eating moderate-sized meals,
but eating only nourishing food (no junk or processed food). Adequate and complete
proteins are essential.
• Be sure and correct vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
• You may need to take digestive enzymes and/or supplemental hydrochloric acid (betaine
HCl).
• Obtain moderate out-of-door exercise each day. This will help your system digest the
food.
• Obtain adequate rest at night, and try to lie down and rest 15, 30, or 60 minutes before
each meal. This is important, and will strengthen your body for the challenge of coping
successfully with another meal.
• Avoid stress of various kinds.
• Eat in relaxed surroundings. Do not eat when you are nervous or upset.
• Try to maintain regularity in all your habits and activities.
• For infants, mashed bananas are more easily digested than some other foods.
• There may be a food allergy, such as wheat, cow's milk, etc. (see Pulse Test).
• It is vital that you not consume fried food, junk food, drink, and processed food. Avoid
caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol. If you are able to do so, do not take medicinal drugs.
• Last but not least: If you are normally thin, but feel good, ignore the comments of others
who say you need to gain weight. Some of them wish they could be thinner.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you will maintain a meek and quiet spirit, which is always obedient to God's
Word, you will be spared many of the troubles which plague so many. Let Christ live in you and help
others through you.

(Thinness)
SYMPTOMS—The person weighs 10% less than an average person of his height and weight.
Symptoms, when underweight, is a problem to be addressed. These symptoms include hunger, dizziness,
fatigue, weakness, sensitivity to cold, and loss of ambition.
CAUSES—Underweight is a problem for some, but not for others. Actually, as one ages, underweight
can be an advantage in a number of ways. If you are in good health, although underweight, there may be
no need for concern to gain weight. Underweight people live longer and are in less danger from heart
disease.
But underweight may be associated with health problems; it should especially be a cause for concern if
unintended, sudden weight loss has occurred.
Try, if possible, to ascertain the cause of the weight loss or inability to gain weight. Here is a list of
several possible causes:
Unplanned-for weight loss can be caused by an inability by the gastro-intestinal tract to digest and
absorb food properly, resulting from ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, etc.
It can be caused by intestinal parasites or liver and pancreas problems.
It can be caused by digestive enzyme deficiency, allergy, or food sensitivity.
It can be caused by endocrine imbalances, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or (sometimes)
hypothyroidism. If you are both underweight and feel cold all the time, you may be hypothyroid (which
see). Problems in the thyroid, pancreas, or adrenal glands can make weight gain impossible.
Hypoglycemics and diabetics have an especially hard time maintaining proper weight.
It can be caused by a chronic illness, surgery, stress, or emotional trauma (such as the death of a loved
one).
It can be caused by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, medicinal or street drugs, or AIDS.
In addition, there may be an eating disorder: The person eats too little (anorexia) or, in some cases, eats
too much.
Zinc deficiency can reduce appetite, and so can some wasting diseases, such as cancer.
The consistency of the bowel movement and a check for undigested foods can be a valuable diagnostic
aid.
The experts tell us that, for adults, weight should not be gained at the rate of more than a pound a week.
In infants and children, the cause may be not enough food; in old people, it may result from disinterest in
eating or poverty.
You should especially be concerned about an infant or small child who suddenly seems to stop gaining
weight normally. This may be caused by celiac disease (which see) or something else."
disease-general-cellulite,Cellulite,"(Lumpy Fat)
SYMPTOMS—Lumpy pockets of fat on the thighs, insides of upper arms, and gluteus maximus.
CAUSES—With the passing of years, strands of fibrous tissue anchor to the skin. As they do this, they
pull the skin inward. This causes fat cells to push upward. Women especially tend to have this problem
in the buttocks, hips, and thighs.
There is no known cure, but there are suggestions you may wish to try:
TREATMENT—Lose weight. This will help reduce the protruding pockets of fat.
• Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. These are both nourishing and lower in calories.
Improve your general pattern of diet and take vitamin/mineral supplements.
• Keep the channels of elimination open, so excess fluids and fat can be more easily
eliminated. Only use a very small amount of salt, drink plenty of water, keep the bowels
open, maintain regularity, and avoid constipation.
• Do not use caffeine or tobacco. Both constrict your blood vessels and make the cellulite
more prominent.
• Do muscle-toning exercises.
• Make sure you are obtaining adequate rest.
• Exercise out-of-doors and breathe deeply. The oxygen helps burn fat; and the better
ventilation helps empty carbon dioxide from body cells.
• To whatever degree you can, avoid stress, tension, and time schedules. Cellulite builds
up when muscles become tense, and muscles tense when you are agitated.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord has honored us by choosing us as His soldiers. Let us fight bravely
for Him, maintaining the right in every transaction. Stand for the right though the heavens fall. God will
help you.
Section 6
Urinary
Part 1
Urine"
disease-general-urine-problems,Urine Problems,"HYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments for several different urine difficulties. This brief summary
is taken from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), which will provide many
more details on how to give the treatments:
Albumin in urine (Albuminuria): Hot Blanket Pack and other sweating measures to maintain cutaneous
activity, repeated every 2-4 hours (p. 233).
Incontinence: Percussion Douche to spine, Neutral Sitz Bath, 15-30 minutes (p. 209).
Urine too acid: Free use of fruit and water drinking in the forenoon (p 249).
Urinary suppression: Hot Blanket Pack, followed by Dry Sweating Pack (p. 215).
Nocturia: Revulsive Sitz Bath. Begin at 100o and increase rapidly to 106o-115o F. (with a footbath at
110o-112o F.) for 3-8 minutes. Keep the head cool with cold cloths over forehead or around back of
neck. Finish with a cold (55o-65o F.) pail pour to hips (p. 120).
ENCOURAGEMENT—The one who had revolted in heaven offered Christ the kingdoms of this
world, to buy homage to the principles of evil, but He would not be bought. When Satan comes to you,
answer him, ""It is written""; and, in Christ's strength, stand true for God."
disease-general-urine-retention,Urine Retention,"TREATMENT
• Poor urine flow: Take a cold sitz bath (cold partial bath, as you sit in the bathtub). Stop
using salt. Drink 2 quarts a day of 50-50 orange juice and water.
• Alternate method: Take a hot sitz bath repeatedly, followed by a short cold bath. If
bedridden, apply hot, followed by short cold, over bladder, genital area, and entire length
of spine.
• Give a high enema of catnip tea. This is important in helping the urine to again begin
flowing.
• Drink more water and take herbs which increase urine flow. Corn-silk tea is the best;
others include juniper berries, carrot tops, comfrey, plantain, cleavers, chickweed.
• Insert a soft catheter and draw out the urine. Steep the following in a quart of boiling
water: 1 tsp. goldenseal and a half tsp. each of boric acid and myrrh. Strain through a fine
cloth, and inject through a fountain syringe. Retain as long as possible. You can moisten
the tip with slippery elm tea. Slipper elm is slippery!
• A cold shower often helps.
• Stopped urine flow: Almost total urine suppression generally points to the kidneys as the
problem.
• Put the person to bed; give him a very warm high enema of catnip tea. This will bring
great relief. Also apply hot fomentations, wrung out of smartweed tea, to the bladder and
lumbar region (small of back). Give 2-3 hot sitz baths in a bathtub, each day.
• An especially helpful remedy is a strong, hot as can be taken, tea of catnip, given as an
enema. Drink it freely.
—Also see the kidney and bladder diseases in this Urinary section.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ's victory over Satan was as complete as had been Adam's failure. So we
may resist temptation and force Satan to depart from us. It is in totally yielding ourselves to God that, in
His strength, we can have power to resist the devil and come off more than conquerors.
INCONTINENCE—1
(Urinary Stress Incontinence)
SYMPTOMS—Occasional dribbling. An involuntary loss of urine, in very small amounts, accompanies
coughing, sneezing, laughing, walking, running, lifting, or any sudden shock or strain.
CAUSES—Incontinence tends to occur in women more than men, although older men may also have it.
A wide variety of causes can be involved—including food allergies, hypoglycemia, multiple dystrophy,
multiple sclerosis, cancer, stroke, injuries, and surgical damage.
Other causes include repeated births, poor pelvic floor tone, damage to pelvic floor by the physician at
time of delivery, failure to do prenatal and postnatal exercises, visceroptosis, overweight, and poor
abdominal tone.
It may follow a prolonged labor during childbirth, resulting from the stretching of the pelvic floor. If
postpartum exercises are not done, this problem, which may disappear for years, may later return.
Incontinence is far less likely in the nullipara (women who have never delivered a child).
• The best pelvic floor exercises are variations of the Kegel exercise, and should begin
early in pregnancy or before, and continue on to at least 3 months after childbirth. These
exercises strengthen certain muscles.
• Slow urine flow and eventually stop it. Doing this helps you recognize the muscles
involved. Later, practice stopping urine flow, hold for 1-2 seconds, and repeat 6-8 times as
you urinate. You should eventually be able to stop urine flow completely with no leakage.
Learn to slowly relax pelvic floor muscles in stages from full contraction to full
relaxation.
• Practice tightening these muscles at various other times during the day. Repeat 6-8 times
each session and 50-100 times a day. Hold each contraction for 2-5 seconds, then relax.
• When doing these exercises, do not hold your breath. Bear down; that is, push down on
the pelvic floor or contract the buttocks, inner thighs, or abdominal muscles. When
beginning, do not exhaust the pelvic muscles. Whenever contractions weaken, discontinue
at that time. Build muscle strength slowly; there is no rush.
• Avoid alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, and grapefruit juice.
• Use cranberry juice instead.
• Reduce general fluid intake, but not too much.
• Avoid constipation.
• Lose weight.
• Go when you have to; do not wait, or you weaken bladder control.
• Double voiding is helpful: After voiding, stand up and sit down again. Lean forward
slightly at the knees and try again.
—Also see ""Incontinence—2."" For incontinence in children, see ""Bedwetting.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The gift of God to mankind was immense. It could not be said that anything
was withheld. God gave all in Christ. Accept Him and you become a child of God, known and loved by
Him.
INCONTINENCE—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
TO INCREASE ENERGY OF BLADDER—Cold Plantar Douche for 1-2 minutes; Cold FootBath,
using running water over the feet; Cold percussion Douche to hips and legs at 600-65o F.; Cold Douche
to lower back; Cold Fan Douche, at 650 F., over bladder. Cold rubbing Sitz Bath. Colonic, begin at 1000
and lower 10 daily to 800 F.
RELIEVE VESICAL IRRITATION—Revulsive Sitz Bath; Hot Pack to pelvis; prolonged Neutral
Sitz Bath, following Revulsive Sitz Bath. Neutral Douche to lower spine; Revulsive Douche to feet and
legs.
IMPROVE GENERAL NERVE TONE—Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub, Cold Pack to
pelvis, general Cold Douche, Shallow Bath, Wet Sheet Rub.
—Also see ""Incontinence—1.""

SYMPTOMS—Flow of urine is lessening. Great pain is felt in the bladder, and the odor of urine is on
the body. Almost total suppression can produce extreme pain in the back and bladder, and even
convulsions. There is always a great desire to urinate.
CAUSES—There can be a blockage of some type. See Kidney Problems, Bladder Problems, and other
topics in this Urinary section.
Urine retention is generally caused by inflammation and swelling in the bladder and its outlet. Excess
urine in it causes the bladder to enlarge, and can cause great pain."
disease-general-hematuria,Hematuria,"TREATMENT
• Apply a very cold water spray to the perineum.
• Read the other sections, below, in this urinary section, on urine, kidneys, and bladder.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When a soul receives Christ, he receives power to live the life of Christ. He
becomes a new man in Christ. He can obey the Ten Commandments and resist sin, for he has God's
help.

Urinary
Part 2
Kidney

(Blood in Urine)
SYMPTOMS—Blood appears in the urine. Blood in the urine shows a smoky sediment, and is reddish
brown. Urine may be slightly smoky, reddish, or very red.
CAUSES—Red, or reddish, urine may be due to blood in the urine, known as hematuria, and to senna or
rhubarb, which may color the urine either brown or orange.
If the blood is well-mixed with the urine, it is probably from the kidneys. If it is clotted in tubular casts
of ureters, it is from kidneys or ureters. If its is passed at the beginning of urination, it is from the
urethra; if at the end, it is from the bladder.
Bleeding from the kidneys produces smoky urine, which may be bright red. Bleeding from the urethra is
always bright red, and precedes urination. Bleeding from the urine vesicle produces bright red urine,
which is not uniform.
Other causes of blood in urine can be a lesion of the urinary tract, contamination during menstruation,
prostatic disease, tumors, poisoning (especially carbolic acid and cantharides), malaria, toxemias, and
calculus (kidney stones)."
disease-general-bright-s-disease,Bright'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• See your physician.
• Take a high enema and a daily hot half-hour tub bath. Give 2-3 cups of pleurisy tea or
sage tea while in the tub. Finish with a short cold shower or cold towel rub. Do not let him
chill. Wrap him up well, put him in bed, and give him more pleurisy tea or sage tea to
encourage perspiration. Fomentations over the lower back and the entire length of the
spine will help alleviate pain. Do this also over the stomach, liver, and spleen.
• For other natural remedies which can help control urinary tract infection, see under
""Nephritis"" and ""Cystitis.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—You do not know how much good you can do by always wearing a cheerful,
sunny face and watching for opportunities to help others. You may not always be appreciated, but God
understands, and your work will be rewarded.

SYMPTOMS—Fever, chills, urgency and frequency of urination, loss of appetite, nausea, and
vomiting. The urine is cloudy from pus, and often bloody. Pain may be intense and sudden in the lower
back, just above the waist, and running down the groin. An excessive amount of blood protein in the
urine is a marked symptom of Bright's disease. It is usually accompanied by hypertension and edema,
which is retention of water in the tissues.
CAUSES—Bright's disease involves a chronic inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis; which see), but it
is unique in the following respect: The kidneys cannot properly excrete salt and other wastes. The result
is that salt and various wastes are stored by the blood in tissues throughout the body. This produces
tissue swellings, edema, and high blood pressure. Blood and protein are also in the urine in excessive
amounts.
Gradually the blood itself becomes contaminated with these waste produces, and uremia (uremic
poisoning) is the result.
Consuming alcohol, tea, coffee, and spices are excellent ways to ruin your kidneys. Do not use
aluminum cooking ware."
disease-general-edema,Edema,"TREATMENT
• If edema is caused by heart disease, then turn to that section. If it is caused by kidney
failure or other causes, then read the following.
• If it is the result of protein or thiamine deficiency, the intake of either or both should be
increased. Fluid can be retained in the belly cavity because the protein content of the
blood is so low that fluid cannot be kept in the blood vessels.
• If excess salt in the diet is the problem, then a very restricted salt diet should be adhered
to. (Too much salt retained by the body requires additional water to keep the salt diluted,
so it will not damage living tissue.)
• Carry out a regular daily exercise program, out-of-doors. Poor circulation because of
liver or heart disease is a common cause of edema. When at rest, elevate the legs. Avoid
tight clothing, and do not cross the legs. Take hot baths twice a week. Avoid stress. Stop
eating meat. Eat more fruits and vegetables, emphasizing the raw foods.
• Avoid processed and junk foods.
• Increasing the vitamin B intake will reduce the amount of fluid retention.

• Take the pulse test, to determine certain foods which do not agree with you. Then avoid
those foods.
• A 1-3 day juice fast will be helpful. But if a protein deficiency is the problem, then
nutrition is needed, not cleansing.
• Helpful herbs include corn silk, dandelion, Scotch broom, alfalfa, Canadian fleabane,
garlic, English hawthorn, juniper berries, lily of the valley, parsley, nettle, marshmallow,
pau d'arco, and prickly restharrow.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Every soul is precious, because it has been purchased by the precious blood of
Jesus Christ. Do all you can to be a help to others in your home and community. Everywhere are souls
needing our help.

Respiratory
Part 1
Breathing

(Dropsy)
SYMPTOMS—Swelling of the hands, ankles, feet, face, abdomen, or other areas of the body. Swelling
is most often seen in the hands, in the feet, or around the eyes. The bloating or swelling causes muscle
aches and pains.
CAUSES—Edema is a fluid accumulation in the body. It can be caused by poor kidney function,
chronic kidney disease, congestive heart disease, varicose veins, phlebitis, protein or thiamine
deficiency, sodium retention, or cancer.
Other causal factors include pregnancy, standing for long periods of time; premenstrual tension; the use
of oral contraceptives; a confining injury, such as a sprain, allergic reactions, or a bee sting.
When the skin indents, forming little pits, when the skin of the feet or ankles is pressed by a finger, the
situation is worsening. Contact a physician.
Fluid retention is sometimes caused by a food allergy. Hypothyroidism, anemia, adrenal malfunction,
constipation, and lack of exercise can be causal factors, along with deficiencies of potassium, vitamin B
complex, or vitamins B , B , or B .

As soon as edema is found to exist, it is well to obtain a clear diagnosis. Once congestive heart disease,
kidney disease, or liver disease are ruled out, more subtle causes can be dealt with more easily."
disease-general-postnasal-drip,Postnasal Drip,"TREATMENT
• Blow your nose regularly, but do it very gently.
• Flush your nose with saltwater and gargle with it. Place a half teaspoon of salt in about 8
ounces of warm water (the experts recommend only a third of a teaspoon, if you have high
blood pressure). Draw the water into an aspirator and put the tip into your nose. Then hold
your head back, so you are looking up—and gently squeeze on the aspirator as you
carefully suck it into your nostrils.
• Although this may, at first, seem uncomfortable, it can bring you a lot of relief.
Conclude by blowing your nose gently, to get all the fluid out. Do this 3 times a day for 5
days.
• Next, gargle with the same ratio of salt in the water.
• Reduce the amount of stress you are under, stop drinking milk, but do drink lots of water
or nourishing fluids. An herb tea with some lemon and honey is helpful.
• A humidifier in the room can keep the air moist.
• Avoid nasal decongestants, nose drops, etc. In the long run, they will cause you more
trouble than they are worth.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you can exert a saving influence over one soul, remember there is joy in
heaven over the one that repents. You may, by careful effort, be the means of bringing back the lost
sheep into the fold of Jesus. It is wonderful to work with the angels.
CROUP—1
SYMPTOMS—The larynx (vocal cords) or trachea (windpipe) narrows because infection causes the
walls to swell inward. There is difficulty in breathing; hoarseness; tightness in the lungs; a harsh,
barking cough; and even a feeling of suffocation. Because their air pipes are smaller, croup most often
occurs in children.
The special symptom of croup is a harsh, wheezing noise as air is breathed in through the narrowed
windpipe and past the inflamed vocal cords, often accompanied by fits of coughing.
CAUSES—Croup can be caused by bacteria or viruses. When caused by a bacteria, croup generally
follows a cold or another mild respiratory infection. But when it is caused by a virus (as happens more
often, especially in boys), more serious conditions, such as the flu, have occurred.
Croup most often occurs during the winter months, and most frequently affects children from 3 months
to 3 years (9 to 18 months is the peak).
• Maintain a good water intake, to help loosen secretions. Only drink lukewarm water. If
the child is told to drink a glass of water after each coughing attack, the coughs will stop
after the third or fourth glass. Water is the best cough medicine.
• Use a vaporizer or humidifier at night, or put a pan of water or tea kettle on a hot plate.
This will help keep the air moist for the child through the night.
• Try to have someone stay with the child. If he is too anxious, you may find it best to
hold him for a time. This will reassure him.
• Avoid sudden temperature changes. Keep the child warm, but avoid overheating.
• During the day, you might wish to put a few drops of eucalyptus oil in a vaporizer; and,
for a time, have him inhale the vapor.
• Echinacea, fenugreek, goldenseal, and thyme are helpful herbs.
• Homemade soups and broths are good for the child.
• Fomentations to the neck and upper chest region bring relief. After the acute phase, a
heating compress may be applied to the chest.
• You can apply hot onion packs over the chest and back 3 times a day. Place sliced
onions between cloths, and cover with a heating pad.
• Steroids and antibiotics are useless if this is a viral sickness. Do not use cough medicines
and other colds preparations, for they tend to thicken the secretions (anti-congestants are
always drying agents) and make it still harder to clear the throat.
• When croup keeps reoccurring, the cause may well be that the child is allergic to some
type of food. Try to ascertain what it might be (see Allergies).

ENCOURAGEMENT—When we accept Christ, we are adopted into His family. We have a nearness
to Him, and can hold sweet communion with Him. We learn what He is like, and we become changed
into His likeness.

—Also see ""Croup—2.""
ASTHMA—1
SYMPTOMS—Difficult breathing, coughing, wheezing, tight chest. Attacks of multiple symptoms can
occur suddenly or gradually. Sometimes there is coughing with thick, persistent sputum that may be
clear or yellow. There is a feeling of suffocation.
CAUSES—Asthma is a lung disease that results in blockage of the airways. During an asthma attack,
the muscles around the bronchi (which are the small passageways of the lungs) tighten and narrow,
making it difficult for air to leave the lungs.
The chronic inflammation and excessive sensitivity of the bronchi produce those constricting spasms.
The bronchial tubes swell and become plugged with mucous. An attack, often occurring at night, usually
begins as a nonproductive cough and wheezing, which is often followed by difficult breathing and a
tight chest. After a few hours it subsides.
But what causes an attack to come on? Only certain people have asthma, and those that do may have an
attack triggered by an allergen or other irritant, such as chemicals, drugs, dust mites, feathers, food
additives, pollutants, fumes, mold, animal dander, tobacco smoke, etc. But other things can also do it:
anxiety, fear, laughing, stress, low blood sugar, adrenal disorders, temperature changes, extremes of
dryness or humidity, or respiratory infections.
About 80% have an allergic disorder, but the others do not. The experts warn that ever-increasing
amounts of pollutants will cause the number of asthmatics to increase. Many workers must continually
live with such things as sulfites, urethane, polyurethane, epoxy resins, dry cleaning chemicals, and many
other chemicals common to industry. In the last decade alone, the number of asthmatics in America has
increased by one third! Children under 16 and adults over 65 suffer the most from it.
Asthmatics are frequently very sensitive to foods containing sulfite additives: potassium metabisulfite,
sulfur dioxide, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, etc. Restaurants use them, to prevent discoloration
in salads and other foods. Sulfites are also added to many other foods by the food industry.
Nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide, and cigarette
smoke are also known to precipitate asthma attacks.
Fumes and strong odors, such as turpentine, paints, gasoline, perfumes, etc., disturb many asthmatics.
There are two types of asthma: intrinsic and extrinsic.
Extrinsic asthma usually begins in childhood, is seasonal, and is usually caused by a definite number of
substances which can more easily be identified. Asthma is the leading cause of disease and disability in
the 2-17 age group.
Intrinsic asthma is the more severe, and generally begins after 30 years of age. Attacks can occur at any
time, and the causes are much more difficult to identify.
About half of asthmatics are diagnosed between 2 and 17, another third after 30. The other one sixth
does not fit either the intrinsic or extrinsic category. For example, some may initiate the problem in their
20s and others may, after their 30s, develop reactions to only one or two seasonal allergens.
But asthma can be difficult to diagnose, for its symptoms are similar to those of bronchitis, emphysema,
and lung infections.
Over a period of time, the attacks can become more frequent, so it is best for the person with asthma to
learn every possible way to lessen the problem. Here are several suggestions:
TREATMENT DURING THE ATTACK—
• Hot fomentations to the back of the neck, thorax, and front of the chest are helpful, along
with a hot footbath. Keep the head cool by sponging with cool water or use a fan.
• Pouring cold water on the back of the neck is useful. As the person bends over, the water
is poured on the back of the neck from a container holding about a gallon of water. From
about 24 inches above the neck, pour it for about 30-90 seconds. Do this 3 times a day
during the critical phase.
• A vaporizer, which blows cold, moist air is helpful during an attack. Menthol or
eucalyptus oil may be added to the water.
• After blending a clove of garlic in a cup of water, drink it. This may be vomited back
out, loosening the phlegm. If vomited, give another cup. The garlic really helps.
• Some take a cup of hot water, catnip tea, or mullein tea each hour.
• At the first sign of an asthmatic attack, sit up straight in a chair for the first 10 minutes.
Inhale through your nose and exhale through pursed lips. This helps press open the
bronchial tubes.
• Then lie on your stomach, with your head and chest over the edge of the bed. Cough
gently for 2-3 minutes, to bring up the sputum. (But, during an attack, some cannot
tolerate this position; instead, they lie face down on the bed with 2-3 pillows under their
hips and a towel under their face.)
• A neutral bath (94o-98o F.) is quieting to the nerves and helps relax them.
• Lobelia is an herb that, when sipped slowly, relaxes the nerves and tends to stop the
spasm. (If one drinks more quickly, it has a different effect, and induces vomiting.)
• Mullein oil is a worthwhile remedy for bronchial congestion. The oil stops coughs
because it unclogs bronchial tubes. When taken with water or fruit juice, the effect is even
more rapid.
• Other useful herb teas include juniper berries, echinacea, and, of course, that old
standby, slippery elm bark.
TREATMENT DURING THE REST OF THE TIME—
• Eat a nourishing diet. Include garlic and onions. Eat lightly.
• Avoid processed and junk food, and do not use nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine. Do not use
chocolate, fish, eggs, and other common allergenic foods. Avoid foods containing
additives.
• Avoid bananas and melons, especially if you are also sensitive to ragweed.
• Do not use milk products. You may be allergic to wheat products. Do not eat ice cream
or other cold liquids. Cold can shock the bronchial tubes into a spasm.
• Research has revealed that a fat-free diet can help reduce asthma attacks.
• Be sure and drink enough water. This vital fluid is greatly needed to keep your lungs and
bronchi free of thickened phlegm.
• Strictly adhere to the above diet.
• Learn to play a wind instrument, harmonica, or sing. Practice deep breathing when you
are out-of-doors. Have regular physical exercise. Hiking, swimming, etc. are good. You
need to build up your lung capacity and utilization. This will strengthen your entire
respiratory tract. A person at rest uses only 10% of his lung capacity; hard work increases
it to about 50%.
• Exhale forcefully through a small drinking straw into a large bottle of water. This forces
the bronchial tubes to expand somewhat and become larger.
• Some asthmatics have problems when they breathe too deeply. One way to minimize
exercise-induced asthma is to wear a mask that retains heat and moisture and limits the
effects of cold, dry air.
• Spend a few minutes each day practicing standing tall, expanding your chest, and
breathing deeply. Devise simple exercises (on the floor, against walls, etc.) which help
you do this.
• Move out to the country where the air is purer.
• Practice breathing through your nose rather than your mouth.
• Go on a juice fast, 3 days each month, of distilled water and lemon juice, to help clean
out the body of toxins and mucous.
• Reduce stress. Avoid worry and fear.
• Get a good vacuum cleaner and get rid of the dust and dust mites in your bed, cushions,
rugs, and floor. Avoid goose feathers (pillows and down coats). Dead cockroaches are
also known to produce a dust which can bring on an attack. House plants may contain
mold spores. Keep the bathroom clean of mold, also under the sinks.
• Eliminate things from the house which harbor dust: carpets, venetian blinds, draperies,
etc. Washable cotton curtains are all right. Avoid the use of electric fans; they stir up dust.
• Practice ""sleep breathing."" This is done by breathing slower and deeper than normal,
with a three second pause at the top of the inspiration and at the end of the expiration.
—Important: Also see ""Hay Fever"" and ""Allergies.""
HYDRO—Neutral Bath at bedtime, Hot Abdominal Pack, copious water drinking, Enema before
retiring, graduated Cold Baths, Renal Douche. Cold Colonic daily in cases of toxemia with dilated

ENCOURAGEMENT—All who have been born into the heavenly family are, in a special sense, the
brethren of our Lord. The love of Christ binds together the members of His family; and wherever that
love is manifested, souls are encouraged and helped.

with dilated colon. Correct any existing stomach disturbance.
INACTIVE SKIN—Sweating process, followed by a cold bath of an appropriate form.
—Also see ""Asthma—1.""

SYMPTOMS—The back of the mouth drips fluid and runs down into the respiratory tract, starting a
coughing attack, or into the voice box.
CAUSES—Most people only experience postnasal drip when they are sick with a bad cold or something
similar. But some have it when they are well. This article is for them. (See Common Cold and similar
articles in that section.)
Normally, these secretions, from the sinuses, flow down the back of the nose and throat and are swept
away by cilia, which are small waving hairlike projections.
But sometimes the mucous dries out and the cilia no longer wiggle. Then the secretions pool in the back
of the nose, thicken, and then begin dripping into the bronchial tubes or into the voice box.
Here are several suggestions, one or more of which may solve the problem for you at such times:"

• Immediate action must be taken. Quickly plunge him into cold water or pour cold water
(the colder the better) on him. This simple procedure powerfully affects the breathing
centers, and he may immediately begin taking deep breaths.
• Then begin other resuscitation treatments while someone calls for emergency help.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When we love others as unselfishly as Christ loved us, then for us His mission
is accomplished. We are fitted for heaven, for we have heaven in our hearts.

Part 2
Bronchial Tubes
BRONCHITIS—1
SYMPTOMS—Coughing and mucous, pain in the chest (and possibly back), fever, sore throat, and
difficult breathing. Sudden chills and shaking may occur.
CAUSES—The bronchial tubes are the airways which lead into the lungs. The bronchi are two main
branches of the trachea. They divide into many smaller bronchi, like tree roots. These, in turn, divide off
into the grape-like maze, called the lungs.
Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi, and is frequently complicated by mucous obstruction of those
passageways. When the bronchi are badly infected, the cause is often viral rather than bacterial.
Irritating substances (or invading bacteria or viruses) cause the bronchi to produce an excess of mucous,
which clogs the airways.
There are two types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. The acute very often occurs as infection in throat
moves on down toward the lungs. A cold or the flu, if not immediately given careful treatment, can
spread into other areas, such as the bronchi or the eustachian tubes. If bronchitis is not carefully dealt
with, the infection will move on into the lungs, resulting in pneumonia.
Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing problem, which results from repeated bouts of acute bronchitis or from
something that is frequently irritating the lungs. This can be allergies, especially tobacco smoke. The
only ones who gain from tobacco are the manufacturers. Interestingly enough, only 9% of bronchitis
patients in the U.S. are non-smokers. Infants exposed to cigarette smoke are far more likely to come
down with bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis reduces the amount of oxygen to the lungs and the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled.
This eventually can lead to enlargement of the heart; pulmonary hypertension; and finally, heart failure.
• Stop smoking and get tobacco out of the house. If you have chronic bronchitis, do not
expect much improvement as long as tobacco smoke is in the home.
• Do not use milk; it produces a thick phlegm which complicates healing. White-flour
products and sugar foods should not be used until bronchitis is past.
• Drink plenty of fluids: pure water, soups, and herb teas. Vitamin C is important! Take it
to bowel tolerance.
• Anise tea and almond milk are helpful in bronchitis. Make the almond milk by blending
6 tbsp. of almonds in a pint of water.
• Cayenne and lobelia will help break up the congestion.
• Add moisture to the air with a vaporizer or humidifier or heat a pan of water on the
stove.
• Remain in bed as long as fever is present. Bronchitis often hangs on because people
think it is about over and begin going about their everyday duties. Go to bed and get well.
• Deep breathing exercises should be taken 3-4 times a day. Take a deep breath, hold it a
few seconds, and exhale. Do this 10-20 times. This will help air out of the infected area.
• Breathe deep. Blow up a balloon several times every day. This helps open up and
enlarge the airways.
• Apply a heating compress at night.
• A hot footbath will help pull the blood away from the chest and reduce congestion.
• Hot drinks help you cough out the phlegm. Coughing is the only way the phlegm can
come out. Do not use cough suppressants while you have bronchitis.
• Apply warm, moist heat or a hot water bottle over the chest and back before bedtime.
This will help relieve congestion and aid in sleep.
• Avoid fatigue and chilling. Do not walk barefoot on cold floors while you are trying to
get well.
• If the coughing gets worse, there is a high fever, wheezing sounds, lethargy, and
weakness. Chest pains develop and very difficult breathing. Contact a health professional;
the condition may be developing into pneumonia.
• If the condition persists over too long a time, there is the possibility of tuberculosis or
lung cancer.
• A professional can use bronchoscopy instruments to examine the bronchial tubes and
suction out phlegm.
• In recent years, a new type of bronchitis has arisen, which is contracted primarily by
women. Difficult to treat, it often continues for 3 weeks to 5 months. Drinking goldenseal
tea is helpful with this condition, as well as with other types of bronchitis.
• Other helpful herbs include pau d'arco, chickweed, ginkgo biloba, burdock, lobelia,
slippery elm bark, echinacea, and wild cherry bark.

After hemorrhage ceases, graduated cold treatment to increase resistance and combat the disease causing
the hemorrhage. See ""Tuberculosis of the Lung.""
—Also see ""Pneumonia."""
disease-general-emphysema,Emphysema,"SYMPTOMS—It is only with great effort that the person can exhale air from his lungs. There is
continual breathlessness. Most any exertion brings coughing. It is hard to breathe in, but worse to
breathe out. The neck veins often stand out from the effort, and he breathes through the mouth in order
to try to get enough air in and out. Breathing is usually rapid and short. He may breathe 25-30 times a
minute, and still not get enough air.
Eventually his chest becomes barrel-shaped, his face ruddy, and he speaks with short, broken phrases.
CAUSES—The word, ""emphysema,"" comes from a Greek word meaning ""to puff up with air."" The
walls of the lungs lose their elasticity, so air cannot be easily pushed in and out, as should normally
happen. So there is air in the lungs, but it is not moving in and out. As emphysema progresses and there
is more obstruction to airflow, the lungs enlarge with trapped air.
The most frequent cause is smoking, but air pollution also receives some of the blame. Live in the
country and do not have tobacco in your home, and you should be able to avoid this problem.
Emphysema has become the most common modern lung infection in the Western world. Needing a
continual exchange of air to survive, we use about a thousand cubic feet of air each day. It passes over
lung surfaces which, if laid flat, would be as large as a tennis court. In emphysema, a large portion of the
alveoli (the grape-like sacs where the air exchange occurs) are destroyed, and the blood is not properly
aerated.
TREATMENT: LIVING WITH THE PROBLEM—
• The person absolutely must stop smoking. Tobacco smoke should be banished from the
home, car, and place of work. Also avoid hair spray and other sprays.
• Avoid allergens that you know of.
• Maintain a program of regular exercise. Walking out-of-doors is always the best. Try
using 1- or 2-pound hand weights and work the muscles in the neck, upper shoulders, and
chest. Those with chronic emphysema need strong muscles there more than others do.
• Eat less and a little more often. Prolonged digestion requires more oxygen and blood to
the stomach, and away from other parts of the body which also need them.
• Avoid gas-forming foods, such as legumes and cabbage. These cause abdominal
distention which can interfere with breathing.
• Sip warm, clear liquids in the morning (such as herb teas), to help clear mucous from the
airways.
• Excessively hot or cold foods may induce coughing.
• Avoid hard-to-chew foods and maintain a low- salt diet.
• Do not eat when emotionally upset or angry.
• Drink enough water. The fluid intake is needed to keep the mucous, in the lungs, thin.
• Maintain your ideal body weight. Some of those with this problem tend to put on weight
and retain fluid. The closer you are to your ideal weight, the better for your lungs. Stay on
a low-calorie diet. The thinner you are, the less flesh your lungs have to supply oxygen to.
• Obesity and constipation decrease the patient's resistance to respiratory infection.
• Keep your clothing loose; this helps you breathe better.
• Learn to breathe correctly. The tendency is to breathe short and fast. But make yourself
breathe steadily, from the diaphragm. Strengthen your respiration muscles by blowing out
slowly through pursed lips for 30 minutes a day. Try to exhale twice as long as it took you
to breathe in.
• Learn to cough properly. Inhale slowly and deeply, exhale through pursed lips, and
cough in short huffing bursts rather than vigorously.
• Pace yourself in your work. Work steadily; it is not necessary to work fast.
• When working, lift while you exhale through pursed lips; inhale while you rest. When
climbing steps, climb while exhaling; inhale when you stop to rest.
• Go through the day relaxed, not with a sense of alarm over your air problems.
• Avoid contact with anyone with a respiratory infection.
• Avoid drugs which suppress coughs. They dry up secretions, which you do not want.
• Use only essential and unscented soaps. Avoid perfumes, gas stoves, carpeting, curtains
and draperies which cannot easily be cleaned. Avoid hot, humid climates. Avoid furry,
feathered animals in your home.
• Get plenty of fresh air. Use a warm scarf or mask over the mouth and nose when
outdoors in cold weather. Keep the body warm at all times.
• Place 3, 4, or 5-inch blocks under the foot of the bed. This will help prevent mucous
from accumulating in the lower part of the lungs during the night. (But not too steep, for
that would be hard on the heart.)
TREATMENT: SOLVING THE PROBLEM—
The suggestions above are typical of what you will find in most books. It is difficult to find remedial
solutions, but here is one:
Several years ago, a Christian mother visited her neighbors, and met a woman with emphysema. It was a
small, stuffy house and the lady smoked. So the mother went back home and eventually found a
treatment; it was a wet heating pack from Kneipp's book, written nearly two centuries ago. She gave the
treatment to the woman, who got well within several weeks. This was the treatment:
• Place a plastic sheet on the bed, both above the bottom sheet and beneath the top sheet
and covers. Dip another sheet in very cold water, and wring it out somewhat—quickly, to
keep in the cold.
• Work quickly: Wrap the sheet about the person, who is standing unclothed. The sheet
covers everything but the head and perhaps part of the neck. Than wrap a dry blanket
around him. The person immediately gets into the bed, and is covered well with the top
sheet and blankets. This is essentially something like a heating pack, but done only with a
wet sheet. The effect is immediate freezing cold, which the body gradually warms. The
person can remain like this all night.
In the years that followed, the mother mentioned the incident to a number of medical people and doctors,
who were astounded; for everyone says there is no cure for emphysema.
ENCOURAGEMENT—By both creation and redemption we are the Lord's property. We are required
to obey His laws, but we are never asked to do it in our own strength. Christ helps us in all that we do."
disease-general-legionnaire-s-disease,Legionnaire'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• Essentially follow the regime listed under ""Pneumonia"" and ""Bronchitis."" See your
health care provider. The present rate is that 80% of those contracting the disease die, so
this disease is a very serious matter. Immunosuppressed patients (such as chemotherapy-
treated cancer patients), transplant patients, and AIDS patients are the most susceptible in
contracting it.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Copy the example of Christ: His love, tenderness, and obedience. Minister to
the needs of everyone around you. They need the peace and happiness that you have found in Christ.

SYMPTOMS—It initially appears to be the flu. There is headache, fatigue, achiness, and moderate
fever. But then it develops into what seems more like pneumonia: a high fever (105o F.) with coughing,
diarrhea, chills, disorientation, slow heart rate, dry cough, infection of the pleura, vomiting, severe chest
pain, and shortness of breath. From lack of oxygen, the skin becomes bluish and sputum that is coughed
up, eventually, is gray or blood-streaked.
CAUSES—This is the strange disease which was first identified at the American Legion convention in
1976, which affected 182 partying in a hotel.
Those who smoke, drink, have diabetes, emphysema, or kidney problems are more likely to contract the
disease. Younger people quickly recover, but the elderly can die from respiratory failure.
The Legionella pneumophila bacteria can be in heating and cooling systems. That is how the
Legionnaires got it in that hotel. The disease is not directly transmitted from person to person, but
through cool water droplets."
disease-general-q-fever,Q Fever,"TREATMENT
• See your physician. Give this problem the care you would give to typhus (which see),
bronchitis, and pneumonia (all three of which see).
ENCOURAGEMENT—There are many from whom hope has departed. Bring back the sunshine into
their lives. You can do this as, prayerfully, you seek to bring a knowledge of Jesus into their lives.
Section 7
Respiratory
Part 4
Pleura
PLEURISY—1
SYMPTOMS—The pleural membranes become swollen and inflamed, and at first rub together with
each breath, causing severe pain and sound that can be heard by a physician using his stethoscope. The
pain becomes suddenly more severe if the person attempts to take a quick deep breath, to cough, or
sneeze.
Fluid may form in the space between the lung and the chest wall. When that happens, the rubbing sound
disappears, as well as most, or all, of the pain. There may only be a little fluid or it may fill half the chest
cavity, compressing the lung.
Pleurisy can also appear on the surface of the diaphragm. In this case, the pain is in the abdomen, at the
pit of the stomach, or can even be referred pain to the shoulder.
In children, pleurisy pain and the pain of pneumonia are frequently located in the abdomen, and cause
others to think there is acute indigestion or appendicitis.
CAUSES—The lungs are enclosed within a sack-like covering. Since the lungs are constantly in
motion, they must be able to slip against this covering without harming themselves or the pleura.
Pleurisy occurs when this sack becomes inflamed. The cause is generally the tubercle bacillus (the cause
of tuberculosis), pneumococcus, or streptococcus; the two later germs are present in pneumonia.
Some pleurisy is always present in lobar pneumonia (see pneumonia); and, in adults, pleurisy is
frequently a complication of tuberculosis (which see).
But the underlying cause is not taking care of oneself: not eating right, not getting enough sleep, or not
avoiding stress and overwork.
• Put him to bed and keep him warm. Give a high enema, and apply fomentations to the
chest and upper back. Continue this for 1-2 hours; let the patient rest, and then repeat.
Keep doing this until the pain has ceased. Maintain hot fomentations; they will disperse
the water in the lungs and keep the pain from returning.
• The fomentations should be large, thick, and hot, and changed frequently. Do about 5
changes, and do not follow with any cold treatment; this is important. Use a hot water
bottle on the chest following the fomentations. It may be kept there nearly all the time. If
his chest is allowed to become chilled, the pleurisy will be come worse!
• Give hot herb teas of pleurisy root, yarrow, valerian, and buckthorn bark. Add skullcap if
the pain is severe.
• An excellent herb tea is a tbsp. each of pleurisy root and yarrow, and a pinch of cayenne.
Put it in water brought to a boil. Let it steep, and then drink a large swallow of the warm
tea every hour.
• Only give fruits, oatmeal water, vegetables, and grains. Allow no meat, milk, alcohol, or
junk food.
• Do not jar the patient. Move him carefully, gently. Jars and quick motions make the
pleurisy worse and greatly increase the pain.
• He, of course, needs fluids, but do not give him too much during the crisis.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God has built a hedge around about His subjects, to protect them. It is the Ten
Commandments. By faith in Christ, we are empowered to obey the Father's law. Doing so preserves us
from transgression. In requiring obedience to the laws of His kingdom, God gives His people health and
happiness.

Cardiovascular
Part 1
Heart
CARDIAC PROBLEMS (Heart Problems; Heart Attack; Heart
Failure)
INTRODUCTION—Heart disease is the number one killer in civilized nations.
There are so many aspects to this, that it seems well to combine them all in one article rather than divide
them into several.
Part of the confusion is that everything is so interrelated: diet, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis,
atherosclerosis, angina, and other degenerative heart changes.
In order to fully utilize the data in this article, you should also carefully read the companion articles.
Some are listed at the end of this one.
SYMPTOMS OF HEART ATTACK—Signs of a soon-coming heart attack may include nausea,
sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, feelings of anxiety, difficulty in swallowing, vomiting,
sudden ringing in the ears, and loss of speech.
The heart attack (angina) itself may feel as a band of intense pressure to the heart. A powerful pain is
produced, which may last for several minutes, often extending to the shoulder, arm, neck, or jaw.
But it may be a small attack, producing relatively little discomfort. Sometimes it is mistaken as
indigestion. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all. This is termed a ""silent heart attack.""
An angina shows itself as recurrent pain beneath the sternum, and lasts 30-60 seconds.
SYMPTOMS OF HEART FAILURE—Shortness of breath, poor color, fatigue, accumulation of
fluids, especially around the ankles (edema).
HEART ATTACK—What is a heart attack? What leads up to it? This article will provide you with an
overview of the problem, along with several specific suggestions.
The cardiovascular system is the heart, a blood pump. The blood is sent through arteries and veins,
throughout the body.
Cardiovascular disease is the name given to several problems which can stop the heart and cause death.
1 - A coronary is one type of cardiovascular disease. The arteries which nourish the heart
muscle itself are the coronary arteries. But if these arteries become narrowed, not enough
oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the heart, and not enough carbon dioxide and waste
products are carried off. This oxygen deprivation causes a tight, heavy chest pain, usually
following some exertion or after a meal. There is a sharp, debilitating pain in the center of
the chest. It is called angina pectoris (or simply angina). The pain generally recedes when
the person rests. But it is a forewarning of events to come.
An angina may be precipitated by stress, exertion, a large meal, extreme cold, emotion, or
other factors. Average life expectancy after the first onset of angina is 5-7 years.
2 - If that blood flow through the coronaries becomes entirely blocked or limited enough,
so that it does not reach part of the heart, then a heart attack or myocardial infarction
occurs. This refers to the formation of infarcts (areas of local tissue decay or death) in the
myocardium (heart muscle). A heart attack does not always kill. But, whether it is mild or
severe, a heart attack always produces some irreparable damage to the heart.
3 - The problem may not be in the heart, but in the arteries which nourish it. The arteries
have hardened (called arteriosclerosis), and when cholesterol and other materials flows
through them, a clot (also called a thrombus) occurs. The hardened walls do not flex to let
the blob pass on through. Arteriosclerosis is responsible for most of the deaths due to
heart attack.
4 - Lack of oxygen and nutrients can also cause spasm of the coronary arteries, resulting
in a heart attack.
5 - Then there is high blood pressure (called hypertension). This is another form of
cardiovascular disease, which also prepares the way for a heart attack. When the heart
pumps blood, the blood shoots through the body at a fairly rapid speed. The muscular
contractions of the heart produce a certain amount of pressure which produces this
pumping action throughout the body. But sometimes the pressure builds up too high. This
also is not the fault of the heart.
Here are some of the things which produce high blood pressure:
• Hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) is a primary cause. Earlier, the flexing of the
walls kept the pressure lower.
• A second major cause of hypertension is a reduction in the size (interior dimension) of
the arteries. They come to look like old water pipes, with congealed stuff sticking to the
walls. For years, certain things had been eaten which caused this problem (meat fat,
grease, saturated fats, hydrogenated vegetables oils, margarine, butter, corn chips, etc.).
• Too much sodium in the diet, for too long a time, is another cause of hypertension. The
solution should have been to cut out the sodium (salty) foods.
• Other causes include stress, enzyme imbalances, certain drugs (including oral
contraceptives), and nutritional deficiencies.
• There are still more factors which could be involved: hyperthyroidism, kidney disease,
adrenal or pituitary disorders, and heredity.
Unfortunately, there is no pain as the hardening and clogging of arteries (which produce hypertension)
progresses. So people keep living and eating the way they should not until one day the crisis comes.
HEART FAILURE—So far, we have only discussed heart attack, which is an interruption in blood
flow to the heart. But there is also heart failure, which is inadequate blood flow from the heart. It is not
providing enough blood to supply the needs of the body. Heart failure can be either acute (short-term) or
chronic.
Here are some of the problems which, over a period of time, can occur in the heart:
1 - Arrhythmia. The heart does not beat right. The natural rhythms are more irregular. This
is caused by problems in the cells in the heart which send out electrical signals to do the
pumping sequences.
2 - Palpitations occur when the heart seems to pound, whether regular or irregular.
3 - Tachycardia is when the heart beats too fast when it is resting.
4 - Bradycardia is when the heart beats too slowly.
5 - Ectopic beats (also called skipped beats) are beats which are premature, producing
longer rests between some beats than between others.
6 - Fibrillation and flutter are a little different. An electrical error occurs, which sends
some beat signals to the heart muscle (causing it to twitch) instead of carrying out its
normal blood pumping action.
7 - Valvular disease is the name for problems in the heart valves, so they do not open and/
or shut properly. Sometimes this is congenital; other times it is caused by rheumatic fever
or endocarditis (infection of the heart muscle).
OTHER HEART PROBLEMS—There are a variety of problems which trace their cause to coronary
problems, artery problems, or heart muscle problems. Here are some of them:
1 - Cardiomegaly (cardiac hypertrophy) occurs when the heart can no longer function
normally; it works so hard that it enlarges. But this only weakens it. Causes include too
much resistance from blood flow through the arteries.
2 - Congestive heart failure is a chronic condition that results in fluids accumulating in the
heart and edema in the feet and ankles. There is labored breathing after mild exertion.
3 - Cardiac arrest happens when the heart just stops beating. Because fresh blood is no
longer reaching the brain, the person falls unconscious. Coronary artery problems are
often the cause.
There are other problems which can occur in the heart, which can also weaken it. But these do not trace
their causes to coronary or artery problems.
1 - Carditis is an infection in the heart muscle, sometimes caused by rheumatic fever. It
can lead to permanent heart damage.
2 - Endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium. This is the sac-like membrane which
surrounds the heart. People with damaged immune systems (from HIV, etc.) can acquire
it. It can also be caused by surgery to replace defective heart valves. Permanent heart
damage occurs.
3 - Cardiomyopathy summarizes several heart problems, including enlargement of one or
more heart chambers, heart muscle rigidity, etc. Causes include inherited defects and
certain diseases.
Here is a brief overview of some of the problems which require changes, if you would avoid a later
build-up of conditions leading to a heart attack:
• Too many saturated fats in the diet (animal fats or hydrogenated vegetable oils).
Excessive use of overheated or oxidized vegetable oils.
• Lack of natural fat emulsifiers (lecithin) in the diet.
• An excess of salt and other sodium products. Drinking chemically softened water. Water
softeners have sodium in them.
• Elevated cholesterol, triglyceride, and uric acid levels.
• A low HDL-to-cholesterol ratio.
• An excess of carbohydrates (especially refined ones) and sugar. Sugar increases
triglyceride levels, platelet adhesiveness, uric acid levels, and blood pressure.
• An excess of vitamin D intake (from meat, milk, eggs, or sunlight). Over 3000 units a
day add to the plaque development and hardening of atherosclerosis. Carotene (pro-
vitamin A) in the diet, from orange and yellow vegetables and fruits, will not cause this
problem.
• A deficiency of vitamins and minerals.
• The use of coffee, alcohol, and tobacco.
• Lack of exercise.
• Overweight.
• High blood pressure.
• Diabetes or gout.
• Taking birth control pills.
• Heavy metal poisoning.
• A family history of heart trouble.
Change everything in the above list that you can, and you will live a lot longer.
Here is still more information:
To properly understand the information given in this article, be sure to read the other articles in this
section, especially those listed at the end of this one, and in the next (dealing with circulatory problems).
• Check your heart beat every so often. The best way to begin the day is to check your
pulse when you wake up in the morning. If it is under 60 beats per minute, you are doing
all right. But if your resting heart rate is above 80, that is not so good, and indicates that
hypertension may be in progress of occurring. An estimated 25% of those who have heart
attacks experienced no previous symptoms. So, right now, start eating right and living
right.
• High blood pressure, using tobacco, high cholesterol levels, stress, obesity, sedentary
living, diabetes, and type-A personality are causes of heart trouble. These are things you
can change.
Here are a variety of factors which you should consider:
• Do not use MSG (monosodium glutamate). Locate your food allergies and eliminate
them (see ""Pulse Test""). Do not use caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, sugar, and processed
foods.
• Caffeine blocks the breakdown of adrenaline, resulting in the same response as heavy
stress. Heavy caffeine consumption doubles the risk of coronary heart disease.
• The dangers of tobacco in producing heart attacks and other heart problems are well-
documented.
• Do not eat any types of grease or oil (fatty foods, meat, margarine, butter, peanut butter,
hydrogenated oil), except a small amount of cold-pressed vegetable oil. (See ""Cholesterol,
Reducing,"" for much more detail.)
• Fat is in all meat. Do not eat meat and you will have a longer life. It is well-known that
vegetarians live longer than others. They have less coronary disease, less heart attacks,
and less heart failure.
• If you are an adult, avoid vitamin D. More than 400 IU per day result in calcification of
the coronary arteries.
• Research studies by the Chinese reveal that constipation is a significant factor in many
heart attacks.
• Eat smaller meals.
• Be sure and drink enough water every day, and frequently throughout the day! This
cannot be stressed enough. Sludged blood is a very real cause of heart and vessel
problems.
• Eat a high fiber diet, using whole grains, brown rice, beans, and fresh fruit and
vegetables. Through nourishing food and supplements, obtain all the vitamins and
minerals. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium are important; so are the vitamins (A, B
complex, C, and E). Eat Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp for trace minerals. Flaxseed
oil contains Omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce risk of coronary heart and cardiovascular
disease. L-carnitine helps dissolve fat deposits around the heart. CoQ10 and germanium
strengthen veins and provide oxygen to the blood and cells.
• If you tend to experience angina attacks at night, place 3-4-inch blocks under the head of
your bed. This will reduce the attacks. More blood pools in the legs, and not so much tries
to crowd in through the narrowed arteries into the heart.
Sodium is a problem which must be dealt with, since it can increase the likelihood of heart disease.
Here are items to omit from the diet:
• Table salt. Use a small amount of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp instead. That
will supply some salt, plus many vital trace minerals.
• MSG (monosodium glutamate), which is an accent flavor enhancer.
• Diet soft drinks.
• Canned vegetables.
• Commercially prepared food.
• Baking soda.
• Foods with preservatives.
• Meat tenderizers.
• Softened water.
• Saccharin products.
• Foods with mold inhibitors.
• Foods with preservatives.
• If you have any kind of heart problem, see your physician. Prevention—living right and
eating right ahead of time—is the best key to success.
Here are additional things to think about:
• Heart disease: Eat no fried foods. Avoid vitamin D. Obtain essential fatty acids; the best
is cold-pressed flaxseed oil or wheat germ oil; also take selenium, vitamin E, 5-10 alfalfa
tablets daily. And, if needed, obtain HCl. Take a 30-minute walk outside every day. Keep
a 30-minute oxygen tank in your house, ready to use when you need it.
• Palpitations: Do not eat MSG, caffeine, sugar, or processed foods. Avoid food allergens.
Obtain vitamins B1, B3, C, selenium, and potassium.
• Cardiac arrhythmia: Avoid food allergens and MSG. Add selenium, chromium,
magnesium, potassium, and CoQ10 to your diet. Hypoglycemia can be a cause.
• Nervous heart: Causes can include anemia and low stomach acid. Obtain B1 and iron.
• Angina: If you survive, take calcium, magnesium, essential fatty acids, and extra
vitamins and minerals. Reduce vitamin D intake from all sources (meat, fish, dairy
products, and the sun). Avoid caffeine, sugar, and cigarette smoke. Exercise for 30
minutes every day.
• Congestive heart failure: Causes can include lung disease and high blood pressure.
Obtain vitamin B1 and selenium.
• Myocardial infarction: Rebuilding afterward (if you are still alive) should include
vitamin C to bowel tolerance, vitamin E, selenium, vitamin A in the form of beta carotene.
Obtain HCl and pancreatic enzymes.
Here is information about fats and oils:
Animal flesh contains fat. Do not eat animals. It increases blood cholesterol. But some vegetable oils are
a problem also. These are refined, heat-treated, and partly (or wholly) hydrogenated oils.
Heating the oil changes it from the cis form to the trans form (also called a trans-fat), which is abnormal
and can cause heart diseases, just as animal fats do. Only use cold-pressed vegetable oils, and not too
much of that.
Then there is the LDL and HDL story. It is also important, if you want to live longer. (In order to
understand more fully the following facts, also read the articles, ""Triglycerides, Lowering"" and
""Cholesterol, Reducing."" Much more information will be found there.)
All kinds of fats (both the grease and oil form) are carried in the blood in a protein-fat molecule, called a
lipoprotein. There are two primary kinds: the low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are large
cholesterol-laden molecules and the high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), which are smaller molecules with
more protein and less cholesterol and triglycerides.
When found at high levels in the blood, the LDLs increase the risk of coronary heart disease. But high
levels of HDLs actually reduce the risk of heart disease. For this reason, the cholesterol-to-HDL ratio is
very important. Physicians even use it to estimate how likely it is that you will have a heart attack. The
HDLs get rid of excess cholesterol in your bloodstream! They carry cholesterol from the blood to the
liver so it can be converted into bile and eliminated from the body. Here are nutritional facts which have
been found since the importance of HDLs was discovered:
• Bran fiber reduces blood cholesterol and triglycerides, increases HDL, and lowers LDL.
Very important, it also helps prevent recycling of bile from the bowel back to the liver.
• Vitamin C helps increase HDL levels and lowers LDL levels. It also activates conversion
of cholesterol into bile salts. Taking 1-2 grams a day can produce a 30% reduction in
cholesterol levels which are 400 or above. Vitamin C also lowers triglyceride levels.
• Vitamin E helps dissolve blood clots, dilates blood vessels, and conserves oxygen so the
heart does not have to work as hard. Because of its antioxidant function, it also prevents
fatty acids from becoming toxic.
• Vitamin B complex helps keep cholesterol from collecting plaque.
• Flaxseed oil (and to a lesser extent, wheat germ oil) is rich in Omega 3EFA, and
decreases platelet adhesion, reduces blood cholesterol, and increases HDLs.
• Lecithin is essential for utilizing fat and cholesterol in the body, and significantly lowers
blood cholesterol levels.
• Brewer's yeast and chromium 15 lower HDL levels, and cause atherosclerotic plaques to
recede.
• Garlic lowers blood cholesterol and reduces platelet adhesiveness, as well as lowering
triglycerides and increasing HDLs. (It also helps normalize blood pressure.)
• Alfalfa meal (from ground seeds) contains saponins which prevent bile-like substances
from recirculating to the liver.
• Soy protein lowers blood cholesterol.
• It should be noted that coronary bypass surgery has failed to prevent second heart
attacks or extend life. It is not the ""cure"" for coronary atherosclerosis and severe angina,
as suggested. The disease is systemic, and heavily influenced by nutritional, and other,
factors. Bypass operations are not the solution. They are only emergency repair jobs
which do not remove the cause—which, unless properly corrected, will only return.
• Fortunately, even the most advanced cases of heart disease can be helped by the
discoveries provided by nutritional research.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus is today in heaven preparing mansions for those who love Him; yes,
more than mansions, a kingdom which is to be ours. But all who shall inherit these blessings must be
partakers of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of Christ. Obey the Ten Commandments, and live to help
and bless others.
PERICARDITIS, ENDOCARDITIS—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,
Formulas)
TO COMBAT INFLAMMATION—Continuous Ice Bag over heart or Cold Compress over heart area
at 600 F., changed every 15 minutes. Rub chest with dry flannel until skin is red.
TO ENERGIZE HEART AND MAINTAIN VITAL RESISTANCE—Cold Mitten Friction; Cold
Towel Rub twice a day.
FEVER—Prolonged Neutral Bath; Neutral Wet Sheet Pack.
PAIN—Fomentation for 1-3 minutes every half hour; Cold Compress changed every 15 minutes during
the interval between.
MYOCARDITIS—Employ all the means recommended above, except avoid Ice Bag over the heart.
—Also see ""Cardiac Problems.""
CARDIOMYOPATHY (Keshan Disease, Muscular Dystrophy of
the Heart)
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—The word means ""heart muscle disease."" This is a disease of the
myocardium, which is the heart muscle itself.
The World Health Organization recognizes that cardiomyopathy is a selenium deficiency disease.
J.D. Wallach, in his book, Let's Play Doctor, makes this statement:
""This is the type of heart disease that makes individuals a candidate for heart transplant . . It is typical
that $1 per month in selenium supplement would prevent this disease and the need for a $250,000
procedure that carries a 20% mortality rate. This disease is also found in cystic fibrosis patients . .
Veterinarians have eliminated this disease [cardiomyopathy] in animals with selenium injections and
oral supplementation of diets.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The wants of the soul, only the love of Christ can satisfy. If Christ is abiding
in us, our hearts will be full of divine sympathy. We will do all we can to help and encourage others.

SYMPTOMS—Some of the symptoms are like those of typhus (which see), and some are like those of
broncho-pneumonia (see Pneumonia, Bronchitis). There is a sudden onset of fever, headache, weakness,
and a pneumonia-like infection.
CAUSES—Q fever is quite rare in the Western world. It is caused by a rickettsial organism (Coxiella
burnetii) and is worldwide in its coverage. First discovered in Australia, it is now known to even occur
in the United States.
It is endemic in domestic animals. Sheep, goats, and cattle are the primary reservoirs for transference to
humans. The disease is spread to humans by bites from an infected tick (Dermacentor andersoni) and
from drinking raw milk."
disease-general-arteriosclerosis,Arteriosclerosis,"(Hardening of the Arteries)
and"
disease-general-atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,"TREATMENT
• Eat high fiber foods that are low in fat and cholesterol. Primarily eat fruits, vegetables,
and grains. Dark green leafy vegetables are important. Wheat bran, and other particulate,
fibers are not as effective as those in fruits, vegetables, and legumes.
• Eat foods rich in vitamin E. This includes nuts, seeds, and whole grains.
• Only use cold-pressed vegetable oils (soy, corn, wheat germ, flaxseed). Never heat these
oils; place them on your food at the table.
• Avoid refined sugar. It has been shown to increase serum cholesterol levels, leading to
atherosclerosis.
• Do not eat animal protein; there is a definite connection between eating it and
cardiovascular disease.
• Do not eat processed, junk, dairy, white flour, spiced, or fried foods. Avoid pies, ice
cream, salt, egg yolks, sugar, coffee, colas, nicotine, and alcohol.
• Garlic eaten with cholesterol foods tends to reduce the likelihood that cholesterol will
clog the arteries.
• If you know you are moving toward artery problems, eat no free oils.
• Eggplant tends to lower cholesterol levels.
• Both peanut oil and coconut oil increase atherosclerosis.
• Drink only distilled water.
• Reduce stress and avoid situations causing it.
• Get regular moderate exercise. Walking every day is the best. Build up slowly, but keep
at it.
• A strict vegetarian diet (without milk and eggs) is a good way to avoid artery problems.
• Research at the University of Wisconsin disclosed that skim milk did not lower blood
cholesterol.
• Overweight people should reduce. Even 20% or more above ideal weight carries a
significantly increased risk of atherosclerosis. What is your ideal weight? Assume 100
pounds for the first five feet; add to this five pounds for each inch over that, for women;
add seven pounds per inch over that, for men.
• Do not smoke or use nicotine in any other form. Avoid second-hand smoke.
• Do not take shark cartilage. It may inhibit production of new blood vessels needed to
increase blood circulation.
• Eliminate all environmental sources of metal poisoning, such as aluminum or copper
cooking utensils, copper or lead plumbing, lead-glazed ceramics, contaminated water, etc.
Toxic metals are known to be deposited, among other places, on artery walls.
• X-rays make premature arteriosclerosis more likely.
• Do not eat big evening meals. Best: Only eat plain fruit and plain bread for supper, and
do this several hours before bedtime.
• Chromium (found in brewer's yeast, whole grains, and supplements) added to the diet
lowers cholesterol.
• Keep the extremities warm, to maintain good circulation in them.
• Do not wear constrictive clothing (belts, garters, girdles, tight hosiery, etc.)
• Glucose intolerance can produce a 100% increased risk of atherosclerosis. Keep your
blood sugar levels normal. Do not binge on sweets, etc.
• Avoid constipation, which weakens the liver and kidneys, which in turn sludges the
blood. The Chinese treat stroke by treating constipation.
• Drink enough water!
• Periodically check your blood pressure.
• Too much vitamin D can elevate blood cholesterol.

HYPOTENSION (Low Blood Pressure)
SYMPTOMS—There are generally few symptoms which will tend to alert you to the problem. There
may be headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, inability to concentrate, or digestive disturbances.
There can be low energy and dizzy feelings when you stand up fast from a lying down or sitting
position, fainting, blurred vision, palpitations, inability to solve simple problems, and slurring of speech.
CAUSES—The pressure at which the blood travels through the arteries is lower than normal, which
means the blood is not circulating through the body quite as efficiently.
This is the ""disease"" which many people are thankful to have. High blood pressure can be a killer; low
blood pressure is generally just something to live with.
A researcher who investigated the strange death of Pope John Paul I (who had low blood pressure and
few other physical problems) asked 30 physicians and specialists whether low blood pressure would
shorten life. Each one said it would tend to lengthen, rather than shorten, life expectancy.
For this reason, you will find that medical guides say relatively little about hypotension.
In some instances, low blood pressure is due to an impoverished diet, the existence of some chronic
wasting disease, or some other condition that needs treatment on its own account. So it can be a
symptom of some other problem (such as hypothyroidism, which see).
Hypotension can be caused by prescribed drugs, kidney disease, low blood sugar, food allergies,
dehydration, adrenal exhaustion, or hypothyroidism.
• Treatment, if needed, should be aimed at locating and eliminating the problem that
hypotension is a symptom of.
• Take vitamin C, to bowel tolerance, and eight glasses of water each day. Obtain
adequate rest at night.
• Eat garlic; it tends to normalize blood pressure to the level it should properly be.
• You may want to do the morning temperature test to determine whether you are
hypothyroid (see ""Hypothyroidism"").
• Helpful herbs include ginseng, spring adonis, and rosemary.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Those who are filled with the love of Christ will not seek to hide their
connection with Him. They will openly rejoice in all He has done and tell others how He can answer
their needs also.
HYPERTENSION (High Blood Pressure)
SYMPTOMS—There may be no symptoms; but, if they occur, they may include headache, difficulty in
breathing, blurred vision, rapid pulse, or a feeling of dizziness.
Overweight, a ruddy complexion, and apparently robust health may be the only outward manifestations
in a man 50 or 60, who may have systolic pressure as high as 200 or more.
Hypertension is called the ""silent killer"" because it so often reveals few symptoms.
CAUSES—High blood pressure is just that: The pressure of blood flow through the arteries is higher
than it should be, and that pressure consistently remains higher.
A blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer) registers two readings: The first and higher one is the
systolic; the second and lower one is the diastolic. The diastolic pressure occurs just before the heart
beats, and is less important for determining blood pressure. But the systolic pressure reveals the pressure
built up as the heart pumps blood out of the heart into the aorta (and thence through the arteries). High
systolic pressure indicates that the cell walls are hardened and/or plaques are forming in the arteries,
which are narrowing the passageways.
Average normal systolic blood pressure in an adult varies between 120 and 150 millimeters of mercury,
and tends to increase with age. The arteries of older people tend to harden and thicken with age, and this
produces the higher readings in later life.
The age, in relation to the figures, tells a lot: Systolic readings of 140-150 at 55 to 70 years of age need
not be considered high; but, occurring in a man of 30, it points to a definite problem which needs
attention.
Normal blood pressure readings for adults vary from 110/70 to 140/90 while readings of 140/90 to
160/90 or 160/95 indicate borderline hypertension. Any reading over 180/115 is far too elevated.
The hardening and clogging produces changes in the arteries, which produce hypertension, and are
caused by aging, emotional stress, food, overeating, and heredity. Tobacco is another cause of
hypertension, as is the taking of oral contraceptives. Drinking coffee or tea, drug abuse, and high sodium
intake are other causes.
Hypertension can result in coronary artery disease, enlargement of the heart, or strokes. The acute
infections (such as tonsillitis, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever), or focal infections from tonsils or teeth,
sometimes lead to Bright's disease (a kidney disease), which is accompanied by high blood pressure.
Sudden attacks of convulsions in pregnant women (eclampsia), and other kidney diseases of pregnancy,
usually cause high blood pressure.
Primary hypertension (about 90% of the cases) do not have a direct cause. The rest (secondary
hypertension) occurs as a result of other diseases. At any one time, about 10% of the people in America
have primary hypertension. It affects over half of all people in the U.S. over 65. African-Americans have
it more than a third more often than whites. Those who are 18-44 have it 18 times more often than
whites. Women have hypertension less often than men until menopause is over; then, soon after, they
have it as often.
Heavy snorers are more likely to have high blood pressure than silent sleepers.
• Habitual overeating, even of good food, will lead to hypertension. A person does not
tend to overeat on healthfully prepared natural foods.
• Excessive protein food, sweats, rich pastry, and desserts must be omitted; but the
reduction of all foods is especially important.
• Do not use salt; this is essential for lowering blood pressure. Read the labels: Many
foods contain sodium. Look for ""salt,"" ""sodium,"" ""soda,"" or ""Na"" on the label. Also avoid
MSG (monosodium glutamate), baking soda, saccharin, soy sauce, diet soft drinks,
preservatives, meat tenderizers, and softened water.
• Only drink distilled water.
• Eliminate all dairy products, for they are high in sodium.
• Do not use processed meats or canned vegetables.
• Stress, fear, anger, and pain increases blood pressure. Adequate daily outdoor exercise
helps reduce the effects of stress.
• Eat a high-fiber diet. Include oat bran; it appears to be the very best type for the purposes
you have in mind.
• For oil, take 2 tbsp. flaxseed oil daily.
• Use no animal fat of any kind; it is best to avoid meat, since there is so much of it in
meat.
• Do not eat chocolate, alcohol, avocados, aged cheeses, and yogurt.
• Include supplemental calcium in your diet.
• Avoid more than 400 units of vitamin D daily.
• Drink fresh vegetable juices.
• Garlic definitely lowers blood pressure. Actually, it tends to normalize it. In those with
low blood pressure, it raises it. Fresh, raw garlic is the best.
• Obtain sufficient rest at night; do not eat later than several hours before bedtime.
• Do a pulse test in order to ascertain offending foods you are allergic to (see ""Pulse
Test"").
• If you are pregnant, check your blood pressure regularly.
• Do not take antihistamines.
• Do not take supplements containing the amino acids tyrosine or phenylalanine.
• Keep your weight down! Loss of weight lowers blood pressure. If you are overweight
and have high blood pressure, you would do well fasting one or two days a week.
• When the situation is critical, special care must be given to produce successful recovery:
• Adequate rest, both physical and mental, is needed, though mild exercise is beneficial to
those with moderate hypertension. Even the visits of friends and relatives may have to be
restricted or prohibited for a time.
• Gradually start mild exercise. Walk out-of-doors and gradually (slowly!) build up the
amount of time spent in outdoor walking.
• All blood pressure medications tend to have negative effects. Moderate exercise, rest,
sleep, and proper diet will provide better help.
• No vigorous or tonic hydrotherapy, or even massage, should be used. The neutral bath
and complete bed rest is needed.
• One recommended program is fruit and rice, alone, for 1-2 weeks.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God can help you overcome the sins which so easily beset you. He can give
you enabling grace to obey the Ten Commandments and remain true to Him, in spite of the compromise
and wickedness in our world.
STROKE—1 (Apoplexy)
SYMPTOMS—Light headedness, fainting, stumbling, blurring of vision, loss of speech or memory,
numbness or paralysis of a finger, coma for short or long periods.
CAUSES—There are four possible patterns which can result in a stroke:
An embolism is a clot that breaks loose and travels on up toward the brain, where the clot gets stuck in a
smaller artery leading to the brain. This briefly cuts off blood flow to a portion of the brain.
A thrombus is a clot inside the brain which blocks the flow of blood to the brain.
An aneurysm is a portion of an artery that balloons outward. Filled with blood, this weak spot bursts.
A hemorrhage is a damaged artery within the brain which bursts.
Sometimes a tumor, not a clot, is blocking an artery supplying the brain.
Whatever the cause, the result is local brain tissue death from lack of oxygen and food.
If the damaged area is small enough, the brain will reroute the affected brain functions to other areas of
the brain, as a period of relearning and compensation occurs.
• So many toxins flow into the blood stream, when the bowel is constipated, that Chinese
medical practitioners prevent strokes and also treat them by eliminating constipation (see
""Constipation"").
• Aneurysms are often caused by copper deficiency which results in weakened elastic
fibers. Once the damage occurs, supplementation with copper cannot repair it, but the
copper can help prevent aneurysms from occurring (2-4 mg/day).
• Surgery will be required for existing aneurysms.
• The varied causes and suggested treatments of clots, artery problems, high blood
pressure, and related problems resulting in strokes are explained in some detail in the
following articles: ""Triglycerides, Lowering""; ""Cholesterol, Reducing""; Hypertension"";
""Arteriosclerosis and Atherosclerosis""; and ""Cardiac Problems.""

ENCOURAGEMENT—Be faithful, and God will give you a crown of life. Study the Bible, obey it,
and do all in your power to be an encouragement and help to others.
STROKE—2 (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
DURING ATTACK—Rest, head and shoulders raised; Cold Compress to head; Tepid Enema; warm
extremities by Hot Water Bottles or Hot Pack. Ice Collar.
AFTER ATTACK—Cold Mitten Friction twice daily; well- protected Hot Abdominal Pack night and
day; carefully graduated Cold Baths; prolonged Neutral Bath; Wet Sheet Pack. Later, carefully begin
graduated exercises; massage; Cold or Alternate Douche to affected muscles.

# TRIGLYCERIDES, LOWERING
PROBLEMS—The two major sources of fat in your bloodstream are cholesterol and triglycerides. Both
are necessary. Cholesterol helps build strong cells, and triglycerides provide energy.
But if either is too high, problems develop.
High cholesterol levels clog arteries. High triglycerides cause vascular disease also, if they are
associated with low levels of HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). You then have fat particles in your
blood which can ultimately be bad for your heart.
You can control your triglyceride level, and you want to keep it below 150.
SOLUTIONS—Here are several ways to do it:
Cut down on the amount of fat in your diet. Reduce total fat intake to less than 30% of daily calories;
but, even better, reduce it to 20%. Reduce saturated fats to 10%.
Eat a lot of complex carbohydrates. Races doing this do not have a triglyceride problem. Cook rice,
beans, and other grains without including fat in the cooking or the serving.
Do not eat candy, sweets, and sugar. Eating such simple carbohydrates in the diet are a significant factor
in causing people to have high triglyceride levels.
Put more fiber in the diet. A low fiber, high sweet, diet is even worse than high sweets alone.
Lose weight. Even losing 10 pounds can reduce triglycerides in those who are 20-30% overweight.
Ultimately, try to maintain a weight that is not over 5-10% above what is normal for your age-weight
range.
Do not drink alcohol; it decidedly increases triglycerides.
Exercise is very helpful in lowering triglyceride levels. Studies reveal that it does this—even when
weight is not lowered in the process.
Go on a rice diet for a couple days. In 1944, Dr. Walter Kempner discovered that a rice diet would
dramatically lower triglycerides.
This is a diet of rice and fruit alone, and no other food, for 2-3 days or as long as you can stand to
remain on it. The diet is not appetizing, but it really works. One patient went down from 1,000 mg/dl to
117 mg/dl in a couple months. In just 2-3 days, triglycerides will go down a fair amount. Then, later,
you can do it again for another couple days.
By the way, when you do this, you will lose a some weight also. The rice/fruit diet is practically fat-free.
But do not remain on a rice diet! It does not provide adequate nutriments.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not dwell on your difficulties, so they get bigger and bigger. Instead, think
on the love of Christ and plead with Him for the help you need. Be trustful and obedient, and He will
give you the best answers.
# CHOLESTEROL, REDUCING
PROBLEMS—Here are some facts about cholesterol, to help you understand the situation:
Dietary cholesterol is in the food you eat. Most of it is found in eggs and meat. One egg has 275 mg, and
an apple has none.
Serum cholesterol is in your bloodstream. This is what your physician measures. Ideally, it should be
under 200. There are two types of serum cholesterol:
HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol cleans the arteries and is good for you. The higher it is, the
better.
LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol clogs the arteries and is bad for you. The lower it is, the
better.
SOLUTIONS—Here are several ways to lower the amount of LDL cholesterol in your blood:
Do not eat saturated fat. This is the kind in meat, butter, cheese, and hydrogenated oil—which is the
worst kind of oil or fat, since it raises blood cholesterol the most.
Only include polyunsaturated fat in your meals. It lowers blood cholesterol. This kind is only found in
certain vegetable oils, such as corn oil, soy oil, wheat germ oil, and flaxseed oil. Only buy cold-pressed
oil—never, never hydrogenated oil (even partially hydrogenated oil). Never put cottonseed oil into your
body.
The very best oils for your health are wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil. Prepare your meals without oil,
fat, or grease. Then add a spoonful or two of wheat germ oil or flaxseed oil to the food after it has been
dished onto your plate. In this way, you can carefully measure how much you get, and you ensure that
the oil was not cooked.
It is safe to use monounsaturated oils. These include olive oil and certain other foods, such as nuts,
avocados, canola oil, and peanut oil. It now known that this also lowers blood cholesterol.
Monounsaturated oils lower cholesterol faster than low-fat diets do, and the type they selectively lower
is the bad LDL.
Do not eat fried food, fatty food, meat, or vegetable loafs, etc. Do not eat processed or junk food. Do not
eat regular peanut butter. The peanut oil has been taken out, and cheap, hydrogenated oils (sometimes
lard) is put in its place. Only buy peanut butter from a health food store. You can open the lid and smell
the difference. Learn how to smell good food. Do not eat corn chips, crackers, and other snack foods.
Eggs contain a lot of cholesterol (275 mg per egg), yet studies reveal that, in most people, they do not
appreciably raise cholesterol levels.
Eat more fruit and beans. Both have pectin, which surrounds cholesterol and takes it out of the body.
Pectin is in all kinds of beans and fruit. Carrots also help lower cholesterol, because of their pectin
content. Cabbage, broccoli, and onions also have calcium pectate.
Oat bran lowers cholesterol in the same way that pectin does it. Make oat bran muffins, and eat one or
two every day. Oatmeal is also effective.
You need 6 grams of soluble fiber every day. Corn and wheat bran are also useful.
Fresh garlic lowers cholesterol, but not cooked or deodorized garlic. It is said that Kyolic may also lower
cholesterol.
Psyllium seed also lowers cholesterol.
Exercise does it too. Vigorous exercise raise HDL and lowers LDL levels.
Do not drink coffee, use tobacco, or drink. Avoid drugs of all kinds.
Here are other things found to lower cholesterol: barley, spirulina, lemongrass oil, and activated
charcoal.
Vitamins C, E, and niacin also lower cholesterol, along with calcium.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We are to love God not only with mind and heart, but with the strength also.
We are to treat our bodies carefully, for we belong to God.
PHLEBITIS AND THROMBOPHLEBITIS (Milk Leg)
SYMPTOMS—Phlebitis: Reddening and cord-like swelling of the vein, increased pulse rate, slight
fever, and pain accompanying movement of the afflicted area.
Superficial thrombophlebitis: The affected vein can be felt and feels harder than normal veins. It may
appear as a reddish line under the skin, possibly accompanied by pain, localized swelling, and tender to
the touch.
Deep thrombophlebitis: Pain, warmth, and swelling, with possible bluish discoloration of the skin of the
limb it is in. Sometimes there is fever and chills. The pain frequently feels like a deep soreness that
intensifies when standing or walking, and lessens when sitting or, especially, when the legs are elevated.
Very often the deep vein in the thigh is involved.
CAUSES—Phlebitis is the inflammation of a vein wall, usually occurs in the legs, and occurs more
often in women than men. It can be a complication of varicose veins (which see). It can be caused by
childbirth, infections resulting from injuries to the veins, and operations. Infections in the legs, feet, and
toes must be given immediate attention (especially if a fungal origin is involved).
There are two types of thrombophlebitis. The first is superficial thrombophlebitis, which affects a
subcutaneous vein near the surface of the skin. This is generally not serious and many experience it. But
if there is widespread vein involvement, the lymphatic vessels may also become inflamed, and fluids
may collect.
The superficial type can result from infection, lack of exercise, standing for long periods, infection, and
intravenous drug use.
Obesity, varicose veins, pregnancy, allergies, environmental chemicals, injury, and smoking can
increase the risk.
Deep thrombophlebitis, also known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is more serious. It affects
muscular veins far below the surface, which are much larger, and can often come after confinement. The
reduced blood flow can produce chronic venous insufficiency, evinced by pigmentation, skin rash, or
ulceration. But sometimes there are no symptoms. The risk of DVT rapidly increases after the age of 40,
and triples with the passing of each decade after it.
Even though the person remains in bed until the swelling subsides, it will return slightly when he gets
out of bed. Very little standing or exercise should be permitted while any swelling persists.
If the opening in the vein, in the thigh, is narrowed too much by the phlebitis (and nearly always if it is
entirely clogged), varicose veins will appear lower down on the leg.
Blood Clots: Blood clots can be very dangerous. The origin of a clot is generally unknown. But it can
form, following an injury to the inside lining of a blood vessel. This initiates clotting, which is part of
the repair process. Blood platelets clump together to protect the injured area. Fibrogen arrives and
entraps blood cells, plasma, and more platelets, which make a blood clot to protect the weakened wall.
If a clot forms, it can break off and travel to a vital organ. Massage or rubbing may cause part of the clot
to be dislodged and pass to other parts of the body, especially the lungs, causing serious damage or
death. If there is any possibility that the person might have blood clots, he should not receive massage.
• If a swollen, painful vein does not disappear within 2 weeks, consult a physician.
• Include niacin in the diet. This B vitamin helps prevent clotting. Vitamin C helps
strengthen the walls of veins and arteries. Vitamin E dilates blood vessels, reducing the
formation of varicose veins and phlebitis.
• Eat a good nourishing diet of fruits, vegetables, raw nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole
grains.
• Do not eat fried, salty, processed foods; dairy products; or hydrogenated vegetable oils.
Do not eat meat.
• A high-protein diet increases blood-clotting factors.
• Use enough fiber in the diet, so you do not have to strain at the stool. Straining increases
venous pressure on the legs.
• Maintain a low-fat diet and drink enough water.
• It is now known that food allergies can be involved. Search them out and eliminate them.
• Get regular moderate exercise. This is important. Walking is the best. Regular exercise
increases the body's ability to dissolve clots.
• Avoid dangling the feet. Pressure against the popliteal vessels may cause obstruction of
blood flow. Do not cross your legs.
• Deep breathing or singing helps empty out the large veins, thus increasing venous
circulation.
• Quit tobacco. If you smoke, and seem to keep having recurring phlebitis, you may have
Buerger's disease (which see). Its symptoms are severe pain and blood clots, usually in the
legs. Smoking constricts the blood vessels.
• Superficial phlebitis inflammation generally is reduced within 7-10 days, but it may be 3-
6 weeks for the problem to be entirely gone. It can be treated by elevating the leg and
applying warm, moist heat to the area. It is not necessary to rest in bed; but, every so
often, rest with the leg 6-10 inches above the heart. This speeds the healing process.
• Take alternating hot and cold sitz baths or apply alternating hot and cold compresses.
• Lie on a slant board with your feet higher than your head for 15 minutes a day,
especially if you stand on your feet a lot.
• Do not wear anything tight about the waist, or bands on the legs.
• If you have to travel a distance by car, stop and walk around every so often. Do not let
the circulation become sluggish. When it enters a low-flow state, that can lead to a clot.
• Beware of ""economy class syndrome."" A remarkable number of people who fly in the
cramped economy class seats of jets develop thromboplebitis. You are confined to your
seat more on planes than in cars or boats. So request an aisle seat and get up every 30
minutes and walk up and down the aisles.
• Wherever you may be, do not sit more than an hour at a time, without getting up and
walking around.
• Better yet, every hour exercise the legs for 2 minutes, as if you are riding a bike (lifting
the legs), and breathe deep, in and out, 15 times.
• Walking barefoot improves venous blood flow.
• If they help you feel better, use elastic stockings (antiembolism stockings).
• Do not squat (sit back on your heels), except momentarily.
• If you have a history of phlebitis or blood clots, do not take the birth control pill. It will
increase the likelihood of deep vein thrombophlebitis by 3-4 times.
• Once you have had phlebitis, or clots of any type, you can have it again. Surgery or
prolonged bed rests increase the likelihood that you will have another attack. Keep that in
mind when you consider elective surgery.
• Fasting decreases blood coagulation, and can be beneficial when needed.
• If you have to lie in bed for a time, move your legs every so often, to increase
circulation. Elevate the foot of your bed several inches, to reduce venous pressure in your
legs. This also reduces edema and pain. Do not use pillows under the legs, for doing so
elevates the knee above the digestive organs and reduces circulation.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God every day for the many blessings you have. Determine that you
will remain true to Him. By His enabling grace, resist temptations and obey His moral law.

(Plaque Development and Hardening)
SYMPTOMS—Early warning symptoms are intermittent claudication (which see). These are pains in
the legs and possibly feet, which leave upon resting. High blood pressure (see ""Hypertension""). The later
result is angina (chest pains) and heart attack.
CAUSES—These are two separate, major diseases, yet we list them together because the problems,
effects, and solutions are so similar.
Arteriosclerosis is hardening of the walls of the arteries; atherosclerosis is the hardening of plaque on the
walls, which causes the walls to harden. (The full explanation is somewhat more complicated.)
Hardened walls produce higher blood pressure, but plaque-hardened and narrow vessels does it also.
The end result of both is a heart attack.
The main difference between the two is that arteriosclerosis is primarily the hardened walls themselves
(which the plaque especially produced). Whereas atherosclerosis is the thickening of that plaque in the
arteries, so that the space for the blood to flow through keeps narrowing. In arteriosclerosis, these
deposits are primarily composed of calcium; in atherosclerosis, the deposits consist of fatty substances,
primarily cholesterol (a blood protein). But, much of the time, an odd assortment of both, along with
lipoproteins, fatty acids, fibrous scar tissue, and blood clump together.
Both conditions have essentially the same effect on circulation, both cause hardening of the artery walls,
both cause high blood pressure, and both eventually lead to one or more of the same things: angina
(which is chest pain following exertion), heart attack (the heart muscle can no longer bear the lack of
blood supply to it), and stroke (when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off). Death may or may
not follow. The problem is that a clot of this plaque breaks loose, flows through the arteries, and gets
stuck in a narrower artery. If this occurs in the heart muscle, angina and a heart attack may result; if in
the brain, a stroke occurs.
To complicate the matter further, not only can arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis cause high blood
pressure, but high blood pressure intensifies them both.
Causes include elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels, eating high cholesterol foods (such as meat,
eggs, whole milk, or milk products).
Other causes include smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, diabetes, emotional stress,
lack of exercise, or a family history of the disease. Advancing age increases the risk factor.
Pain in the legs (usually in the calf, but sometimes in the feet or elsewhere in the legs), which increase
when walking but stops as soon as one rests, is intermittent claudication (which see). There may also be
weakness, numbness, and a heavy feeling in the legs. This is a symptom of atherosclerosis in the limbs
(peripheral atherosclerosis). There can also, but less often, be pain in the arms.
There is a home test you can do to help determine if this is beginning to occur: Test the pulse in your
legs and foot. There are three places where this can be done: Apply light pressure on the top of the foot,
the inner hollow of the ankle, and in the hollow behind the knee. If you feel no pulse, then the artery
may be narrowing.
Atherosclerosis is the most common form of arterial disease in the U.S. and most frequently occurs in
the lower limbs. It is the primary cause of death over the age of 65. Over 50% of the people between 65
and 70 will die of some form of this."

Section 8
Cardiovascular
Part 3
Blood

SYMPTOMS—Visibly distended veins. There may be aching or tiredness, a feeling of fullness in the
limbs. The skin may have a tense or burning sensation. Muscle cramps may occur, especially at night.
Hemorrhage under the skin may cause the skin to discolor (light brown to bluish). Veins may be
abnormally large, bulging, and lumpy looking.
CAUSES—The valves of the veins no longer function properly. They become stretched from excess
pressure. The deep veins are surrounded by muscles which keep them in shape. But those close to the
surface (saphenous veins) are ones which develop these problems.
Contraceptive medications can induce varicose veins, as well as hormonal vasodilation just prior to
menstruation. They can occur during pregnancy (especially during the first 3 months).
Straining at the stool, because of the lack of dietary fiber, causes constipation and can result in varicose
veins, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, phlebitis, and hiatus hernia."

• Improvement of a hypothyroidism condition (which see).
• Take 800-1,200 IU of vitamin E daily. Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance. Also needed:
niacin, RNA, and folic acid.
• Purifying the blood stream will help in restoring proper circulation. This would include
enemas or colonics, juice fasting for a day or two, followed by a nourishing diet.
• Do not eat meat; fatty, processed, or junk foods. Do not eat cheese.
• Take cool morning showers or alternating hot and cold showers for 5 minutes morning

afterward, you did not gain.
• Exercise outdoors and practice deep breathing.
• Drink red clover, sassafras, and burdock teas in order to clean the blood.

ANEMIA—1
(Simple Anemia, Iron Anemia)
SYMPTOMS—Easy tiring, dizziness, headache, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath or exertion, and
pale skin, nails, and lips. There is a sensitivity to cold, poor appetite, and cravings for clay, ice, or starch.
CAUSES—There are several types of anemia (simple, pernicious, sickle cell, folic acid, copper, etc.)
This article will deal only with simple anemia.
Millions of people are anemic. The cause is usually a reduction in the number of red blood cells, or the
amount of hemoglobin, in the blood. In either case, not enough oxygen is carried throughout the body.
Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, and occurs when there is not enough iron in
the body.
This can occur when the body is not absorbing enough iron from the food, during chronic blood loss,
pregnancy, menstruation, hemorrhoids or ulcers, diverticular disease, liver damage, surgery, repeated
pregnancies, periods of rapid growth, and aging.
Infections, hemorrhage, and nutritional deficiencies can also cause it.
Infants and young children on a milk diet, without minerals and essential fatty acids, are prone to
anemia.
Red blood cells are called erythrocytes, and are tiny discs which are concave on both sides. These cells
contain hemoglobin, which is bright red because of the iron in it. About 60-70% of the iron in your body
is in the hemoglobin in your blood. (About 30-35% of the iron is stored in the liver.) There are more red
blood cells (RBCs) in the blood than elsewhere. The percentage of RBCs in the blood is called the
hematocrit. The primary function of the RBCs is to carry oxygen to the cells.
Following birth, the bone marrow of the infant, child, and adult makes the red blood cells. Aging causes
RBC formation to lessen. An average RBC wears out in 120 days or less, so your body must keep
making more.
• Eat at least 1 tbsp. of blackstrap molasses each day (1 tsp. for a child). This is the richest
source of food iron.
• Avoid milk and other dairy products, since these decrease iron absorption from other
foods.
• Avoid these oxalic acid foods which include spinach, sorrel, Swiss chard, chocolate,
cocoa, and soda. Almonds, cashews, and most nuts and beans also have some. Broccoli,
lettuce, and tomatoes help iron regeneration.
• Never eat rhubarb; it is extremely high in oxalic acid.
• Avoid spicy foods, tea, or coffee. They decrease absorption. Do not smoke, and avoid
second-hand smoke.
• Bran tends to link with iron and carry it out in the stool. (However, you may need bran to
prevent other physical problems far worse than a mild case of simple anemia.) Whole
wheat flour and oatmeal are effective in increasing hemoglobin regeneration.
• Orange juice increases iron absorption.
• There should be sufficient stomach acid to absorb the minerals. If there is not, take some
lemon juice.
• Yeast and wheat germ are high in iron. Similar foods include beets, beet greens,
cabbage, whole grains, celery, parsley, cherries, dates, figs, and pears.
• Do not take calcium, vitamin E, or zinc at the same time as iron supplements. They
interfere with each other's absorption.
• Use a diet high in fresh, raw fruits and vegetables, which are high in vitamin C (which is
necessary for iron absorption).
• Omitting sugar increases iron absorption.
• Bananas are moderately helpful in increasing iron absorption.
• Many medicinal drugs destroy vitamin E and cause anemia. Some insecticides destroy
bone marrow, so new blood cells cannot be made.
• Do not use food additives or artificial sweeteners.
• It is said that cooking food in iron pots increases the iron content of the food.
• Water from deep wells has more iron than city water.
• Exercise stimulates the production of blood.
• Short, cold baths increase blood production and circulation.
• A cold mitten friction is a useful way to increase metabolism and blood production.
• Have a complete blood test taken, so you will be certain whether or not you have iron
anemia. Too much iron can damage the heart, liver, pancreas, and immune cells' activity.
It has also been linked to cancer. If you do not need them, avoid iron supplements.
• Ferrous sulfate and other iron compounds are often given to reduce anemia, but they
definitely have toxic effects which you should be aware of:
They destroy carotene and vitamins A, C, and E. They increase the need of the body for
oxygen and damage unsaturated fatty acids. They also damage the liver, especially when
the person has a poor appetite and is not eating very much.
• Iron salts taken during pregnancy are especially dangerous! They can increase the fetus'
need for oxygen, induce miscarriage or premature and postmature births. Some infants
have malformations or mental deficiencies because their mothers took iron supplements
before birth.
• Normal people do not need iron supplementation, for there is lots of iron in most real
(real) food. The iron in unrefined food is never toxic. All iron supplements cause stomach
or intestinal irritation.
• Those who are anemic tend to have sore mouths or tongues, generally have poor blood
circulation, and are cold. They need special care in regard to these matters.

ENCOURAGEMENT—We are to have a spirit of pity and compassion toward those who have
trespassed against us. Pray for them, that they may come to Jesus. Unselfish ministry is the hallmark of
the genuine Christian.
ANEMIA—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
INCREASE BLOOD-MAKING PROCESS—Graduated cold applications. The Radiant Heat Bath is
especially valuable as a means of heating before giving the general cold applications; aseptic dietary, a
nourishing diet; rest in bed, if he is emaciated; out-of-door life; cold-air baths; sunbaths; sea bathing;
massage; oxygen inhalation.
GENERAL METHOD—Cold water is the most valuable of all measures in treating anemia. Apply
twice daily, graduating carefully. Autointoxication, arising from dilation or prolapse of the stomach or
chronic constipation, is often an important factor.
—Also see ""Anemia—1.""

SYMPTOMS—Cold hands and feet, and numb tingling fingers and toes. A general sense of chilliness
when others are warm.
CAUSES—Poor circulation can be caused by cardiovascular disease, low thyroid, and vitamin E
deficiency."
disease-general-chlorosis,Chlorosis,"(Green Sickness, type of anemia) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,
Formulas)
Chlorosis is a form of anemia in adolescent girls, generally due to faulty diet during puberty. It is also
called ""green sickness.""
CORRECT ENTEROPTOSIS—Abdominal supporter; abdominal massage; corrective exercises; Cold
Douche to abdomen.
INCREASE VITAL RESISTANCE—General graduated cold procedures (Tonic Frictions) twice
daily.
COMBAT AUTOINTOXICATION—Aseptic diet; sweating bath (Hot Full Bath) to begin
perspiration, Radiant Heat Bath or sunbath, followed by short cold application.
VASOMOTOR SPASM—General Revulsive Douche; Alternate Full Bath at 1050-1100F., 30 seconds,
and then into one at 800-900 F., for 15 seconds; simultaneous Revulsive Douche.
VISCERAL ANEMIAS—Douches to visceral (trunk) areas; Alternate Douche or Revulsive Douche,
with short percussion for either; Alternate Compress over the afflicted part, followed by a well-protected
Heating Compress; protected (plastic covered) Hot Abdominal Pack at night; Cool Enema at 750-680 F.,
1-3 pints, daily.

disease-general-pernicious-anemia,Pernicious Anemia,"TREATMENT
• Take 50-100 mcg injections of vitamin B .
12
• Eat a highly nutritious diet, rich in protein, calcium, vitamins C, E, and iron.
• Take supplements of the entire B complex, to aid in B absorption.
12
• (Important exception: Folic acid should not be taken in amounts greater than 0.1 mg
daily.) Folic acid has the effect of concealing the symptoms of pernicious anemia,
permitting the unseen destruction of the nervous system to continue until irreparable
damage has occurred.
• There should be sufficient stomach acid to absorb the minerals. If there is not, take some
lemon juice.
—Also see ""Anemia—1.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—A lamp, however small, if kept steadily burning, may be the means of lighting
many other lamps. Our sphere of influence may seem narrow, our ability small, our opportunities few,
yet God can work through us to help many others.
BLEEDING, EXTERNAL
SYMPTOMS—Bleeding from a surface wound.
CAUSES—When a blood vessel is cut, bleeding (external bleeding) or hemorrhage (bleeding from
internally) begins. If an artery is cut, the blood spurts and flows fast, and is usually bright red. If a vein is
cut, the blood is darker and flows more constantly and slowly.
• When external cuts are bleeding, cover the cut with powdered cayenne, and it will stop the bleeding
immediately. When an artery or vein is severed, apply powdered cayenne immediately. Then apply
direct pressure, seek a physician, or go to a hospital.
—Also see ""Wounds.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—True happiness does not consist in the possession of wealth or position, but in
the possession of a pure, clean heart, cleansed by obedience to the Word of God. How thankful we can
be that God can enable us to obey His laws and resist temptation to sin.

SYMPTOMS—Weakness, slight yellowing of the skin, tingling of the extremities, and gastrointestinal
disturbances causing a sore tongue. There can be partial loss of coordination of the fingers, feet, and
legs. Some nerve deterioration may occur. Diarrhea and loss of appetite may also be present.
CAUSES—Pernicious anemia is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B . This is a severe form of anemia
12
in which the bone marrow fails to produce mature red blood cells.
The stomach has to be able to produce what is known as ""intrinsic factor,"" in order for vitamin B to be
12
absorbed by the intestines.
Pernicious anemia rarely occurs under the age of 30, but it becomes more common with age.
Without treatment, pernicious anemia may be fatal."
disease-general-hemorrhage,Hemorrhage,"SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—Bleeding in the stool, which indicates stomach ulcers (black blood
stool), ulcerative colitis (bloody mucus in stool), colon cancer (bloody mucus in the stool), and
hemorrhoids (bright red blood).
Coughing blood indicates lung cancer and tuberculosis.
—Also see ""Peptic Ulcers,"" ""Colitis,"" ""Cancer,"" ""Hemorrhoids,"" ""Tuberculosis,"" ""Nosebleed,"" and
""Menstrual Disorders,"" etc.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The consciousness that you are doing those things which God can approve
will make you strong in His strength; and, by copying Christ the great Pattern, you may be able to be the
blessing He intends for you to be in this world."
disease-general-hemophilia,Hemophilia,"TREATMENT
• Eat a diet high in vitamin K. Foods rich in K and other essential clotting factors include
alfalfa, broccoli, egg yolks, kale, and all green leafy vegetables. Green drinks are also
good for K and other essential clotting.
• The hemophiliac is given blood transfusions periodically to provide the missing blood
factors.
ENCOURAGEMENT—To go forward without stumbling, we must have the assurance that a hand all-
powerful will hold us up and an infinite pity be exercised toward us if we fall. God alone can, at all
times, hear our cry for help.

SYMPTOMS—When a wound occurs, blood does not clot normally.
Early warning signs of internal bleeding include a bubbling or tingling sensation or a feeling of warmth,
tightness, or stiffness in the hemorrhaging area.
Headache, confusion, drowsiness, or a blow to the head may indicate bleeding in the head.
If your hemophiliac child cries for no apparent reason, refuses to walk, use his arm or leg, or seems to
have a swelling or unusual bruising, go to an emergency room.
CAUSES—Hemophilia is hereditary. It primarily affects males and is passed down through females
(who are carriers). Children of carriers have a 50% chance of inheriting the defective gene. If they
inherit it, the boys will be hemophiliacs, and the girls will be carriers. The sons of hemophiliacs will not
give the problem to their sons, but the daughters will always be carriers.
As many as two-thirds of all hemophiliacs, in America, have HIV. They contracted it from contaminated
blood transfusion sources. About 450 babies are born with hemophilia each year.
The blood of hemophiliacs does not clot properly, but minor bleeding is not serious. It is internal
bleeding that can be fatal, if not treated.
Bleeding frequently occurs in the knees, which causes painful swelling. Repeated swelling destroys the
knee cartilage and results in a permanently stiff knee (called hemophiliac arthritis). Other joints can also
be affected. Other body parts, including the brain, can also be affected by internal bleeding."
disease-general-blood-poisoning,Blood Poisoning,"TREATMENT
• Apply two hot fomentations and then one cold towel over the affected area. Continue
this alternate application until the red lines disappear.
• Apply a poultice of lemons or charcoal. Or crush one or more of the herbs listed later in
this article.
• Take a high enema.
• Drink as many cups of echinacea tea a day as possible.
• Keep the temperature evenly warm, have enough air, and give a little cayenne in water
when he feels chilly.
• Drink charcoal water.
• Wash wound thoroughly with boric solution. If discharge from the wound is thin, apply
powdered 50-50 myrrh and goldenseal directly to the wound.
• Go on a cleansing program of juice fasting for a time, followed by rebuilding on a good,
nourishing diet.
• Drink tea of chickweed, plantain, goldenseal, and myrrh.
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is a solemn thought that the removal of one safeguard from the conscience,
the failure to fulfill one duty, the formation of one wrong habit, may result not only in our own ruin, but
in the ruin of another.
Section 9
Nervous-Mental
Part 1
Miscellaneous
INSOMNIA—1
(Sleeplessness; Sleep Apnea)
SYMPTOMS—Inability to get to sleep, night after night.
CAUSES—If it only happens once in a while, it is sleeplessness; if it happens for weeks or months, it is
insomnia. (Sleep apnea will be discussed later in this article.) It is said that 100 million Americans have
insomnia, to one degree or another, and take 600 tons of sleeping pills each year to avoid it. About seven
times as many women as men experience the problem. Sleeping pills are second only to aspirin sales in
the U.S.
Side effects from sleeping pills includes anxiety, depression, skin rashes, irritability, loss of appetite,
poor coordination, digestive disturbances, difficulty with vision, confusion, dizziness, high blood
pressure, circulatory and respiration disorders, breakdown of parts of the blood (such as the white blood
cells which fight infection), damage to the central nervous system, memory problems, and liver and
kidney damage.
The experts tell us that, if you go to bed on time, have a current of fresh air in the room, and lay there
quietly—you will get enough rest even though you do not seem to fall asleep as quickly as you might
wish. Many people who report not getting to sleep at night actually slept quite a bit without realizing it.
Many people have a hard time getting to sleep at night because of restless leg syndrome (which see).
These people are awakened by legs which twitch or kick.
There are others who experience sleep apnea. This occurs when the person, while asleep, stops
breathing for as long as two minutes at a time. He then gasps for breath and may awaken. This can
happen as many as 200 times at night. Those with sleep apnea tend to have higher than normal blood
pressure, are more likely to have strokes, and are at greater risk of heart disease. These people also have
a higher incidence of emotional and psychotic problems.
Overeating, eating too close to bedtime, and eating bad food can produce sleeplessness or insomnia.
Systemic disorders in the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, lungs, digestive organs, endocrines, and brain
can all affect sleep.
• A lack of calcium and magnesium can cause you to wake up after a few hours and be
unable to return to sleep.
• Eat nutritious food, and let breakfast and lunch be your main meals. Only eat lightly in
the evening, and several hours before bedtime.
• Foods with the amino acid, tryptophane, promotes sleep. These include figs, dates, and
whole grain crackers.
• Avoid cheese, bacon, chocolate, ham, sausage, and wine before bedtime. Better yet, keep
those junk foods entirely out of your diet. Do not eat eggplant, sauerkraut, potatoes, sugar,
spinach, or tomatoes before retiring. All the foods in this paragraph contain tyramine,
which increases the release of norepinephrine, a brain stimulant.
• Other foods which keep people awake include fatty foods, sugar, white flour, salt,
monosodium glutamate (MSG), chemical preservatives, additives, and allergenic foods.
• Obtain enough exercise during the day, with some of it being out-of-doors. Exercise
regularly in the late afternoon or early evening, but not right before bedtime.
• Before bedtime go outside and walk around quietly in the fresh air for 30 to 45 minutes.
• Take a hot bath (not a shower) an hour or two before bedtime.
• Some people need to have the bedroom quiet. Others need some sound to mask
background noise. In such cases, have a fan turned on.
• Trust in God. He promises to give His beloved rest.
• Regularity in your habits is important. This is vital to good sleep. Always go to bed at
the same time, and get up at a definite time. The body has normal rhythmic cycles. People
with regular habits have faster reaction time and are happier than those with irregular
sleeping times. Getting up each morning at the right time will help you go to sleep at the
right time each night. Sleeping in, on weekends, disrupts the biological clock. If you want
sleep problems, stay up late every so often.
• For some people, daytime naps make it more difficult to sleep at night. But, for some
older people, a little rest before mealtime during the day helps them, so that any
sleeplessness at night never fatigues them.
• If you cannot sleep, you can just lay there, relax, and rest. This is nearly as good as
sleep.
• Or you can get up and do something quietly and calmly for a short time—and then go
back to bed and to sleep. One excellent method is to go outside and breath the fresh air,
look up at the stars, breath some more fresh air—and then go back to bed and to sleep.
• If you are wakeful one night, do not nap the next day, and you will be more likely to go
right to sleep that night.
• Go to bed early when you are sleepy.
• Some take melatonin or calcium to help them go to sleep. These are both natural and
safe aids in promoting sleep.
• The room temperature should be 60o-65o F. If the room is too warm, you are more likely
to move about more and awaken more frequently. The problem is a lack of air.
• If you want a restful night's sleep, make sure a little current of air is passing through
your room, even in the winter. But you cannot sleep well when it is stuffy.
• Do not take sleeping pills. They have pain relievers, bromides, antihistamines, and/or
scopolamine. These are ineffective and produce unpleasant side effects.
• Alcohol, barbiturates, and hypnotics do not solve the sleep problem, but worsen it.
Alcohol disrupts sleep later in the night. Nicotine appears to be calming, but it is actually
a neuro-stimulant.
• Do not take caffeine substances after lunch.
• Do not take nasal decongestants and other cold medications. They stimulate many
people and keep them from getting to sleep.
• Restless leg syndrome (which see) can be a problem. Calcium, potassium, magnesium,
and zinc supplements help eliminate that problem. In addition, make sure you are not
anemic. (See anemia).
• Studies reveal that, in countries where people regularly nap during the day, there are less
accidents, and productivity is higher. The important factor here is consistency. Be regular
in your hours for sleep at night. If you nap during the day, be regular in that. If you nap,
generally keep your naps short—less than an hour at a time.
• Herbal teas which help increase sleepiness include hop tea, catnip, and chamomile. But
do not rely on herb tea, to help get you to sleep every night.
• Make sure you have a good mattress to sleep on.
• Keep your thoughts heavenward, and you will find it much easier to go to sleep at night.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Every faculty with which the Creator has endowed us should be cultivated to
the highest degree of perfection, that we may be able to do the greatest amount of good of which we are
capable.
INSOMNIA—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
TO RELIEVE BRAIN CONGESTION—Neutral Douche, 3-5 minutes at bedtime; Cold Douche; Hot
Leg Bath; Footbath under running water; heating Wet Sheet Pack, followed by Wet Sheet Rub; Hot
Abdominal Pack, warmly covered and protected with plastic; heating Leg Pack; dry heat to the legs and
feet; Hot Leg Pack followed by Cold Mitten Friction to the legs; Heating Compress to legs or Leg Pack
at bedtime, to be prolonged during the night; Hot Abdominal Pack and Leg Pack through the night;
Revulsive Douche to the legs at 102o F. for 2 minutes, then 60o F. for 15 seconds; Neutral Douche, 3-5
minutes; downward stroking of head and neck [to eliminate phlegm and aid lymph flow].
RELIEVE IRRITABILITY OF THE BRAIN CELLS—Prolonged Neutral Bath at bedtime; neutral
Wet Sheet Pack; Enema, if constipation or flatulence are present.
IRRITABILITY OF SOLAR PLEXUS OR LOWER BACK NERVES—Abdominal Fomentation
followed by abdominal Heating Compress, changing every 6 hours. Avoid eating anything but fruits
after 4 p.m. Copious water drinking. Colonic, especially if the bowels are inactive, as constipation is a
frequent cause of insomnia by producing irritation of the abdominal sympathetic nerves.
EXCESSIVE CARDIAC ACTIVITY—Ice Bag over heart.
FIDGETINESS OR RESTLESSNESS—Warm Pail Pour to spine, at 95o-98o F. Tepid Sponging;
rubbing of limbs; rubbing of spine; massage of head.
GENERAL IRRITABILITY—Neutral Wet Sheet Pack; Neutral Full Bath; Neutral fan Douche or
Shower, for 2-4 minutes.
GENERAL METHOD—There may be said to be three forms of insomnia: Sleeplessness may be due to
(1) congestion of the brain, (2) irritability of the brain cells, or (3) a combination of these two conditions.
Here is how to go to sleep: (1) Come to God, and in peace of heart, trust in Him. (2) Relax and let your
mind rest; do not try to problem-solve, you just gave them all to Jesus. (3) Check the temperature and
air; it is more difficult to go to sleep in a room that is too hot, too cold, too drafty, or one lacking fresh
air. (4) With your nerves and muscles relaxed and cheerful in the thought of Jesus' love, concentrate on
breathing slightly deeper, and go to sleep.
—Also see ""Insomnia—1.""

(Septicemia)
SYMPTOMS—Swelling, severe localized pain, discoloration, red streaks from the wound up the veins
toward the heart, and sores that do not heal.
CAUSES—Whenever a sore, cut, or abrasion becomes red and infected, it could produce blood
poisoning."
disease-general-vertigo,Vertigo,"TREATMENT
• Immediately, sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor and stare at a fixed object for a
few minutes.
• But, if the cause is low-blood pressure, lower your head while the blood gets up there.
• Eat a nutritious diet, including niacin, B , and the entire B complex—including B , B ,
6 1 2
and pantothenic acid. Vitamin C is also important.
• Do not take over 2,000 mg of total sodium per day. Too much sodium disrupts the
operation of the inner ear.
• Take powdered peppercorns.
• Avoid nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, and fried foods.
• Catnip tea will help.
• If vertigo begins after taking some new drug, stop using it immediately.
• If vertigo seems to be chronic, search out the causes. You may need professional help.
—Also see ""Motion Sickness.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—When you live a life dedicated to helping others, yours is a life full of
satisfaction and happiness. This is the will of God for you, even your sanctification. Obey God's laws,
and find ways to bless others, and you will best fulfill your earthly probationary life.
NEURASTHENIA—1
(Nervous Exhaustion)
SYMPTOMS—The symptoms vary greatly. Most frequently there is easy fatigue, a sense of great
weariness after slight exertion, or inability to perform a normal amount of mental or physical labor.
There may be mental depression, impaired memory, and inability to concentrate. There may be a sense
of fullness, pressure, or pain in the head.
Pains in the neck, shoulders, back, and limbs. Tender spots on the spine.
Dizziness, ringing in the ears, attacks of palpitation and distress about the heart.
Cold feet, clammy hands, hot flashes about the head.
There is generally constipation, a disturbed digestion, and sleeplessness.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• A variety of causes may, and probably are, involved. For example, the person may be
hypothyroid and fears to exert himself. Yet vigorous, out-of-door activity is probably what
he needs, along with fresh air, sunlight, and nourishing food.
• The orthodox approach is to prescribe rest and quiet. But it may be that getting outside
and walking around is a better solution during part of the day. Find someone who needs
help.
• Start taking on small challenges, and then expand them. Begin by washing the dishes and
sweeping the floor. Do something useful, and thank God that you can.
• Eat nourishing food—and nothing else. Include niacin and the entire B complex. Do not
eat between meals. Chew your food well. Do not overeat. Do not go on binges.
• Stop consuming all fried, processed, and junk food and drink. Stop alcohol, tobacco,
caffeine, and hard medicinal drugs. Avoid chemicals in the food, air, and water.
• Take a cool shower; jump out and dry off in the cooler air.
• Run down the road a few yards. Go in and lay down and rest. Go outside and run again.
Keep pushing yourself, and get yourself built up.
• Avoid enervation. Think positive. Be thankful for what you have and what you can do.
—Also see ""Neurasthenia—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—God gives us strength and time to build characters which He can improve. By
the enabling grace of Christ, put away sin from your life and live to bless others.
NEURASTHENIA—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
NOTE—Neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion) is not a distinct pathological entity, but a group of
symptoms due to various etiological influences and connected with various morbid states.
BASIC ASPECTS—Rest cure for those who have been overworked, nervously and physically, and for
those who are mentally and nervously tired.
COMBAT AUTOINTOXICATION—Aseptic diet; fruit diet; daily Neutral Baths 1-3 hours; sweating
procedures of short duration (3-6 minutes), followed by suitable cold applications; Hot Enema daily;
copious water drinking; out-of-door life.
COMBAT EXHAUSTION—Rest for the overworked. Improve digestion, in cases of starved
dyspeptics, by appropriate measures. Tonic cold applications carefully graduated; especially Percussion
Douche to spine.
CHECK EXHAUSTING DISCHARGES—Apply appropriate measures. See under ""Leukorrhea,"" and
""Spermatorrhea.""
RELIEVE REFLEX IRRITATION—If sexual, rectal, prostatic, or urethral irritation, employ
Revulsive Sitz Bath, Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath, Hot Footbath, Hot Pack over pelvis. For ovarian
irritation, in addition to above, hot vaginal irrigation for 15-20 minutes.
IRRITATION OF SOLAR PLEXUS AND SYMPATHETIC NERVES—Fomentation over
abdomen 3 times daily; during intervals, Heating Compress; abdominal supporter.
IMPROVE GENERAL NERVE TONE—Graduated cold applications. The Cold percussion Douche
to spine is the most efficient of all measures; general Cold Douche; very Hot Douche at 1100 F. for 30
seconds, followed by Graduated or Cold Douche.
HEADACHE—Hot and Cold Compress; Revulsive Compress; to spinal area, give Alternate Compress
or Sponging; Hot Footbath; Footbath under running water.
FRONTAL HEADACHE—Revulsive Compress to forehead and eyes; Hot and Cold Truck Pack;
derivative applications to feet and legs.
CONGESTIVE HEADACHE—Ice Bag to back of head and Cold Compress to face; Ice Collar; Hot
and Cold Compress to head; Hot Footbath; Hot Leg Pack; Heating Compress to legs; Cold Footbath
under running water; Alternate Footbath; and wear felt shoes.
OCCIPITAL HEADACHE [on back of head]—Hot Compress or Sponging to upper spine and
occipital region. Revulsive Compress; Hot and Cold Compress to head. [The occipital region is the area
around the bump on the back of your head).
NERVOUS HEADACHE—Fomentation to seat of pain, with simultaneous Hot Footbath; Daily Cold
Enema to relieve constipation if present; special attention to the diet; a dry aseptic diet is indicated,
avoiding milk.
SENSATION OF BAND AROUND HEAD—Hot Sponging or Hot Compress; Alternate Sponging of
neck and upper spine; massage to head.
SENSATION OF PRESSURE AT VERTEX [top of head]—Hot Footbath, Cold Compress to head;
Ice Collar; sleep with head elevated; heat to feet and legs if cold.
PAIN IN EYES, INTOLERANCE TO LIGHT OR USE OF IN READING—Light Fomentation
over eyes and forehead, but never over naked eyeball: Close eyelids and lay gauze or thin, dry cotton
cloth over it, beneath the Fomentation; protect eyes from bright light; facial massage and massage to
eye. An oculist should be consulted, for eyeglasses may be needed, temporarily or permanently.
BACKACHE—Fomentation to abdomen, Hot Abdominal Pack, abdominal supporter, Alternate Spinal
Sponging or Alternate Compress, Revulsive Douche to spine, Revulsive Sitz Bath.
VERTIGO—Fomentation to stomach, followed by Hot Abdominal Pack; bathing face or top of head
with very hot water or Hot Compress for 2 minutes, followed by Cool Compress, 15 seconds; heat to
back of neck in anemia of the brain.
ANOREXIA—Cold Hot Water Bottle over stomach for half an hour before meals, with Cold Compress
or Cold Water Bottle to area, front and back, opposite stomach; Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel
Rub.

by Enema; abdominal supporter; Revulsive Sitz Bath; Neutral Pail Pour to spine.
DREAMS—Neutral Bath for half an hour before going to bed; Hot Abdominal Pack; evaporating head
cap; elevate head of bed; avoid eating after 4 p.m., except fruit.
COLD EXTREMITIES—Revulsive Douche to legs and feet, followed by standing Shallow Bath;
Fomentation to abdomen twice daily, followed by heating compress during the intervals between;
Alternate Footbath; massage to feet and legs; Cold Mitten Friction.
GENERAL METHOD—While not recognizable as a distinct malady, it is convenient from a practical
standpoint to consider neurasthenia (general exhaustion) as a disease. The tonic effects of cold water are
essential in the treatment of neurasthenic conditions. The management of cold applications in such a
way as to secure the tonic effects desirable without aggravating any of his symptoms is a problem which
taxes, to the utmost, the skill and experience of the hydrotherapist. Special attention must be given to the
digestion, improvement of nutrition, regulation of the bowels, and the relief of prominent and distressing
symptoms by suitable palliative measures.
—Also see ""Neurasthenia—1.""

(Dizziness)
SYMPTOMS—Dizziness, faintness, or light-headedness. The person may feel that he is falling or
sinking or that the room is moving around him, sometimes even spinning. This sensation is usually
accompanied by nausea, vomiting, perspiration, headache, or hearing loss.
CAUSES—Vertigo is caused by an impaired sense of balance and equilibrium, and is generally due to
an inner ear problem. Older people have it more often than those younger.
If the original cause is concussion, skull fracture, or injuring the inner ear, the dizziness may occur long
after the injury supposedly healed.
Other causes are anemia, brain tumors, high or low blood pressure, psychological stress, lack of oxygen
or glucose in the blood, nutritional deficiencies, viral infection, fever, changes in atmospheric pressure,
the use of certain drugs, middle ear infections, excess wax in the ear, or blockage of the ear canal or
eustachian tube.
Lower oxygen levels at higher altitudes can also cause it. Another cause is vitamin B and niacin
6
deficiency.
You can expect that you may temporarily experience it if you engage in certain activities, such as
amusement park rides, sailing, or virtual reality games.
Be aware that dizziness can be a warning sign of a coming heart attack or stroke. It can also be an
indication that a concussion has just occurred.
Dizziness is not the same as vertigo. From time to time, anyone can experience some dizziness or
faintness. Those with low-blood pressure will frequently experience this when standing up suddenly."
disease-general-chorea,Chorea,"(Nervous Twitching) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC FACTORS—Combat anemia and improve general nutrition by graduated tonic applications
(Tonic Frictions); copious water drinking; large Enema or Colonic; Fomentation to abdomen morning
and night; Heating Compress during intervals between. Secure mental quiet by isolation, if necessary.
He should be kept in the open air as much as possible. Out-of-door life and rhythmical gymnastics are
especially useful.
INSOMNIA—Prolonged Neutral Bath or Neutral Douche, Hot Abdominal Pack.
AGITATION—Neutral Pail Pour to spine, Wet Sheet Pack.
IRREGULAR MOVEMENTS—Neutral Pail Pour to spine, daily; prolonged Neutral Bath; special
exercises.
ENDOCARDITIS—Ice Bags over the heart.
GENERAL METHOD—Improve the nerve tone by tonic measures and careful attention to nutrition.
Train him to better mental and moral control and to combat choreic movements by systematic gymnastic
training.

Stress, Anxiety, Pain"
disease-general-stress-and-anxiety,Stress And Anxiety,"TREATMENT
Find out what your ongoing problems are and solve them. Problems are like a wall; you can go through
them, go over them, or go around them. You go through a problem when you eliminate it. You surmount
an immediate problem when you figure out a way to sidestep it and still do what is needed. You go
around it when you learn to live with an ongoing situation you cannot solve. You stop worrying about it
or letting it bother you, and turn your attention to other things.
Here are several basic suggestions:
• Think positive in every situation. See a good side to it, and learn to make the best of it.
See it as an interesting challenge to solve difficulties. Trust in God to help you weather
every crisis and carry on through to the end.
Think about something else for a time. That will help your brain to rest and your emotions
to calm down. Gradually answers will come to mind.
• Counsel with a good friend. If it is a problem with your husband, counsel with a woman,
not with a man. The same holds true for a man.
• The primary problems in a person's life are employment, spouse, money, children,
deadlines, and guilt.
• Sometimes you need to temporarily leave a threatening situation and get away and calm
down, take time to pray and rest your mind.
• Stretching your muscles can help move a circulation made sluggish by the situation, so
you can think better. Massage muscles which have tensed up. Drop your jaw and move it
left to right. This helps relax the jaw muscle.
• Take a hot bath; that really relaxes you, so you can start thinking constructively again.
• Go outside and walk in the open air. Hold your head up, breath deeply, and relax.
• Many times, the underlying need is to go to God and ask forgiveness, obey His Ten
Commandment law, and start living a new, clean life. Make things right with those you
have wronged.
• Believe that, with God's help, the situation can be dealt with. Keep trusting Him as a
little child trusts his parent to lead him by the hand across a busy street.
• A change in diet is needed to help restore a sickly immune system. Fresh fruit and
vegetables, especially raw vegetables. Kelp or dulse, and raw seeds or nuts. Be sure and
take enough vitamin C, as well as a full range of supplementary vitamins and minerals.
• The following herbs are helpful: ginkgo, echinacea, dong quai, gotu kola, bilberry, milk
thistle, catnip, chamomile, hops, skullcap, and valerian. Take them separately or mix 2-3
together, and take as a tea.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you would find happiness and peace in all you do, you must do everything
in reference to the glory of God. Seek earnestly to imitate the life of Christ, so others will be helped
toward the pathway to heaven.
HEADACHE—1
(Nervous Headaches; Cluster Headaches)
SYMPTOMS—A pain or ache in any portion of the head.
Cluster headaches: Often occurs as a one-sided headache which comes on suddenly, causes debilitating
pain, and comes and goes in severity.
CAUSES—Over 45 million Americans repeatedly have headaches. About 18 million have migraines.
Common causes of headaches include eyestrain, tension, poor ventilation (lack of fresh air), sinus
pressure, constipation, allergies (food, pollens, chemicals, etc.), stress, anxiety, muscle tension,
infection, anemia, hunger, fever, hormonal imbalances, trauma to the head, nutritional deficiencies,
sinusitis, alcohol, drugs, tobacco, spinal misalignment, temporomandibular joint syndrome, or airborne
pollutants and chemicals (perfume, industrial fumes, etc.). Diseases of the eyes, nose, or throat can also
produce them. Niacin or pantothenic acid deficiency, an overdose of vitamin A, a vitamin B deficiency,
or disturbances of the digestive or circulatory system can bring them on. Birth control pills can also
cause headaches (by causing a vitamin B deficiency).
6
The headache may be caused by a reaction to a certain food, such as chocolate, wheat, sugar,
monosodium glutamate (MSG), dairy products, hot dogs, luncheon meats, citric acid, vinegar, or
marinated foods. Sulfites, found in certain foods, can do it. Fermented foods, such as sour cream, yogurt,
and cheeses can do it also.
There are three important subtypes of headaches. Emotional stress is an important cause in all of them:
Nervous headaches. These are muscle contraction headaches. The experts tell us that 90% of all
headaches are caused by tension, worry about problems, conflicts with others, etc. Nervousness causes
the muscles to tighten up.
Cluster headaches. These are severe, recurring headaches. These are also called histamine headaches,
and are related to allergic reactions. Inhalant allergens may be a cause (including perfume, house dust,
cigarette smoke, etc.). They may occur by themselves or be associated with other problems and diseases,
including chronic fatigue syndrome (which see). Keep a diet diary. Ninety percent of those with cluster
headaches are men.
• When a headache comes, apply cold compresses to the place where the pain seems to be
originating. This reduces muscle spasms and constricts blood vessels. Leave a damp
washcloth in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or dip the cloth in water with ice cubes, wring
it out, and apply. Also take an enema.
• Place a heating pad, hot towel, or hot water bottle on the shoulder muscles, and possibly
on the neck. Do that which helps you best.
• Get enough sleep.
• Do not overeat. Include enough fiber in your meals and take an enema weekly.
• The treatment for headache depends on the underlying cause. Headaches caused by a
certain problem frequently return. So identify what is causing them and many future
headaches will never occur.
• Sometimes repeated headaches are a symptom of a serious disorder.
• Make sure you are taking enough B vitamins, especially niacin and pantothenic acid.
Vitamin A and iron are also important (but be sure and get your iron from food, such as
blackstrap molasses, not from chemical supplements).
• Consider the lists, given above under ""causes.""
• Regular exercise can help prevent tension headaches. Exercise when it occurs, but do not
exercise if it is severe.
• Get enough sleep, but do not oversleep.
• Eat on time, and do not eat problem foods.
• Stand tall; sit tall.
• Breathe deeply.
• Bright light can cause squinting, eyestrain, and headaches.
• Do not chew gum. The repetitive chewing can bring on a tension headache.
• Do not use much salt.
• Do not overdo. Learn to live within your limits.
• When you have to face high altitudes, take additional vitamin C, to avoid a high-altitude
headache.
What are sometimes thought to be sinus headaches are actually tension headaches, migraines, or cluster
headaches. When the headache is recurring, it is probably not sinus trouble.
• Keep a diary, to help you determine the cause of the headaches. Note date, time of day,
where the pain is felt, and any comments about what you think might be possible causes.
• If any of the following symptoms occur with the headache, the situation may be more
serious and you may want to consult a professional: fever and stiffness in the neck,
sensitivity to light, loss of speech or confusion, throbbing of the head and temples,
pounding heartbeat, pressure in the facial sinus area, visual color changes, or a feeling that
your head may explode.
• If you think that something you just ate might bring on a terrible headache, take 5
charcoal tablets within an hour; and, as soon as you can, take an enema. (But do not take
charcoal tablets daily.)
• Helpful herbs include valerian, feverfew, balm, fleabane, cowslip, lavender, and white
willow.
There are many types of headaches. Here are a few of them:
• Nervous tension headaches: Continual pain in one area or many, with sore muscles in
neck and upper back, plus lightheadedness and dizziness. Treatment of this most common
of headaches includes application of ice packs on neck and upper back. Take extra vitamin
C and P (bioflavonoids). Avoid sugar, caffeine, food allergens, stress. Get enough
exercise.
• Cluster headaches: Strong, throbbing pain on one side of head, tearing of eyes, flushing
of face, congestion of nose. May occur 1-3 times a day for weeks or months. Take enough
protein, avoid inhalant allergens, and keep a diet diary.
• Hangover headache: This headache has throbbing pain, and is caused by drinking liquor.
Put ice on the neck and drink lots of water and fruit juices. Stop drinking alcohol.
• Exertion headache: This headache is caused by physical exertion or sexual excess.
Apply ice packs to the point of pain, improve the diet, and stop the excesses.
• Caffeine headache: It is a throbbing pain, and happens when you try to quit your coffee
addiction too fast. Drink a small amount of coffee, to stop the headache and then gradually
keep getting away from this addiction.
• Sinus headache: A nagging pain to the right and left of the nose and over it. Apply moist
heat, to reduce sinus trouble (see ""Sinus Trouble""), and take more vitamin C.
• Bilious headache: The temples throb, and there is a dull headache in the forehead. It is
caused by overeating, wrong eating, and inactivity. Take an enema; then change your diet
and get more exercise.
• Menstrual headache: A headache which feels like a migraine (which see), and occurs at
menstruation or during ovulation. Take potassium, magnesium, and vitamin B .
6
• Hunger headache: A general headache which occurs just before mealtime, and is caused
by skipping meals or excessive dieting. Eat better meals, which include complex
carbohydrates and protein, to help carry you to the next meal.
• Eyestrain headache: Pain in the frontal lobes, just behind the eyes. Many think this is
caused by uncorrected vision problems, but it can also be caused by too much brain work
at late hours. Change your way of life; perhaps you need a change in eyeglasses.
• Arthritis headache: Pain at the back of the head or neck, which increases with
movement. Feverfew herb teas are recommended, but not during pregnancy.
• Hypertension headache: A dull pain over much of the head, increased by movement.
Lower your blood pressure.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Holiness is an entire surrender of the will to God; it is living by every word
that proceeds from the mouth of God; it is doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in
trial, in darkness as well as in light; it is relying on God with unquestioning confidence; it is resting in
His love.

—Also see ""Headache—1.""
MIGRAINE—1
SYMPTOMS—Generalized or one-sided head pain and possibly nausea, vomiting, and visual
disturbances (light sensitivity, bright spots and patterns before the eyes). It might last for days. The first
sign is frequent flashes of light or tingling. There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cyanosis
(blueness) of the fingers from lack of circulation and oxygen. The pain is most common in the temple,
but may occur anywhere on the head, face, or neck. The pain is frequently on one side, but it may
change to the opposite side, alternate sides, or be on both sides.
CAUSES—These are caused by a disturbance in the blood circulation. There is alternating constriction
and dilation of the blood vessels in the brain, and occurs between the ages of 10-30, more often in
women (70%) than men. Food allergies are frequently the cause. Search them out. Here are six of the
most common causes: food allergy, low blood sugar, tension, depression, water retention, and
menstruation. There often are no migraines during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, or after
menopause is past.
Migraines can disappear for years and then reappear. They usually decrease after middle age.
Over 50% of those with migraines report that one or both parents also had the problem.
• Resting in a darkened room with an ice cap to the head is helpful. There may first be an
increase of pain, but within three minutes, the symptoms may disappear, except for a mild
headache.
• As soon as one begins, if possible, take an enema. This will help stop the attack.
• When an attack begins, try wrapping something tight about the head.
• When it is a throbbing pain, place light pressure on the arteries of the neck for a few
seconds at a time.
• Vigorous daily out-of-door exercise helps decrease attacks.
• Maintain a regular schedule. Too much sleep, too little sleep, missed meals, etc., may
trigger an attack. Do not sleep in late. Some people must avoid naps during the day.
• It is thought that 25% of migraines trace their cause to food allergies (see ""Allergies"").
Various studies have identified the following causes: cola drinks, chocolate, pork, corn,
onion, garlic, eggs, tea, citrus, wheat, coffee, cane sugar, yeast, beef, alcohol, cheese, fried
foods, seafood, mushrooms, and peas.
• Eliminate any suspected food from your diet for five days, and see if that helped solve
the problem.
• Chills can induce migraines. Tiredness, anxiety, or eating late also can. Other causes
include antibiotics, high-salt diet, odors and inhalants, tobacco smoke, caffeine, refined
carbohydrates, fatty fried foods, emotional stress and resentment, and allergy shots.
• Exposure to sunlight triggers migraines in some people. They cannot take the bright light
in their eyes. Staying in the shade on bright days does not cause this problem.
• The amino acid, tyrosine, produces a breakdown product, called tyramine. Tyramine is a
significant cause of migraine headaches. It does this by releasing norepinephrine from
brain tissue, which causes constriction of scalp and brain blood vessels.
• Any substance which has undergone bacterial decomposition (such as cheese) has high
levels of tyramine. Other foods with it include plums, oranges, bananas, raspberries, and
avocados.
—See ""Migraine—2."" Also see ""Headache"" and ""Headache—2"" for many more suggestions.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We must take hold of divine power, and with determination resist the
temptations of Satan. Through the enabling strength which Christ provides, we can be more than
conquerors in the battle with evil.
MIGRAINE—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
PREVENT FORMATION OF URIC ACID—Avoid use of meats, also tea and coffee, etc.; aseptic
dietary; out-of-door life.
ELIMINATE URIC ACID—Hot Baths, especially moderately prolonged sweating baths, followed by
short Cold Baths; Radiant Heat Bath; Wet Sheet Pack; Steam Bath; prolonged Neutral Bath; water
drinking.
LOWER ARTERIAL TENSION—Hot Full Bath at 1020 F., 5-10 minutes; Hot Leg Bath or Hot Leg
Pack; Hot Enema; rest in bed in a darkened room.
PAIN—Hot Footbath; Alternate Compress to spine or sponging of spine; Revulsive Compress to seat of
pain; local application of Ice Bag in some cases; Hot Leg Pack; protect the eyes from light.
NAUSEA AND VOMITING—Ice pills, ice to stomach and the spine opposite the stomach.
CONSTIPATION—Colonic.
TO PREVENT ATTACK—Fruit diet; large colonic; water drinking.
TO RELIEVE HYPERESTHESIA OF LOWER BACK NERVES—Fomentation over abdomen,
twice daily; continuous Heating Compress during the interval between; abdominal supporter.
GENERAL METHOD—Every case is curable by sufficiently prolonged treatment, carefully managed.
The general nervous system must be built up by measures essentially the same as those indicated for
neurasthenia and other conditions requiring tonic treatment. The causes must be removed, especially
autointoxication and morbid reflex influences arising from dilation of the stomach, enteroptosis, and
indigestion.
—Also see ""Migraine—1.""

(Nervousness)
SYMPTOMS—Depression, anxiety, irritability, chronic fatigue, low-stress tolerance, nervous
exhaustion, unable to cope, insomnia, panic attacks, unable to relax, or diseases caused by immune
problems.
Tightening of stomach muscles which causes nausea or digestive problems. Increases in blood pressure,
sweaty palms, nervous twitches, tooth grinding, trembling when not cold. Tense muscles, especially
shoulder muscles.
Poor concentration, cannot retain information, negative thoughts, loss of sense of humor, demanding
attitude, critical attitude, or becoming withdrawn.
CAUSES—Here are a few of the many causes: deadlines, pressures, problems at home or work, special
occasions, crowds, noise, pain, traffic, temperature extremes, overwork, lack of sleep, smoking, alcohol,
a worrywart attitude.
Researchers estimate that stress is significant in 80% of all major illnesses, including cancer, back
problems, endocrine, cardiovascular, skin, and infectious diseases.
The adrenals especially suffer from stress. This results in a lowering of the immune system's ability to
protect you from infection and cancer. It also disrupts the function of your entire endocrine system.
Everyone experiences stress from time to time, but frequent stress is more serious. And long-term stress
wears out the body.
Some people can handle stress better than others. Some individuals work in the emergency room at the
hospital and thoroughly enjoy the excitement and challenge of every new crisis which comes along.
Others burn out and have to transfer out within a year."
disease-general-neck-pain,Neck Pain,"TREATMENT
• Place an ice pack on the back of the neck or apply ice, wrapped in a towel.
• Then place heat on the painful area. This can be a heating pad or a hot shower.
Here are several longer-range solutions:
• Do neck exercises each day, to stretch your neck muscles and strengthen them.
• To stretch those muscles, slowly tilt your head forward and back and turn from side to
side.
• To strengthen them, put your hand on the side of your head and push. Then do the other
side, and then the back and front. Hold light weights (3-5 pounds) in your hands, keeping
your arms straight while shrugging your shoulders.
• Sit in chairs which give you good back support.
• Sit up, not forward. Keep your head level and pull in your chin. Arrange your work so
you can look forward, and not downward, most of the time.
• Stop every so often and take a break.
• Always lift heavy things carefully with the legs and not the back.
• Sleep on a firm mattress.
• Do not sleep on your stomach, but, better, on your side or on your back.
• Keep your neck warm when you are outside in the cold.
• You may do better with a smaller pillow or no pillow at all.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God that there is hope for each one of us! In Christ we can have the
victory over every temptation, and come off more than conquerors. Trust in Him and He will carefully
guide you step by step.
NEURALGIA—1
(Neuropathy)
SYMPTOMS—Pain which comes on suddenly, followed by intervals of freedom from pain. The pains
are severe and seem to shoot along the course of the affected nerves. The nerve trunks become tender to
pressure. In severe cases, there is twitching of the muscles of the affected part, with burning and tingling
sensations in the skin. The attacks are rarely on both sides of the body at the same time. They generally
continue from a few minutes to a few days, and may occur frequently for months. As time passes, the
attacks tend to become more severe.
CAUSES—Neuralgia is nerve pain; neuritis (which see) is nerve inflammation.
Neuralgia is an irritation of a nerve which can be caused by many factors, including trauma, nutritional
deficiencies, herpes, shingles, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or alcoholism.
Chilling an area of the skin is a frequent underlying cause, as well as nutritional deficiencies including
the B complex (especially B , B , folic acid, pantothenic acid, and B ).
1 6 12
Other causes include decayed teeth, wrong diet, constipation, tension, insomnia, fatigue, exposure, lack
of exercise, sinus infections, and eye strain.
A frequent cause of the problem in the various forms of neuralgia is chilling of part of the body over a
period of time, when the rest of the body is relatively warm. This is most likely to occur in the winter
months, when you are in bed sleeping. A current of cold air is passing across your face, and the rest of
your body is tucked under the covers.
The result is tic douloureux (which see) or Bell's palsy (which see) on the face or neck or, if the
shoulders are uncovered, neuralgia of the shoulder or some other area.
The cause can also occur as a result of regular commute driving. A window is kept open slightly to
provide fresh air but a slight chilling breeze blows on the face for perhaps a total of an hour each day.
The formula for trouble is (1) chilling draft to part of the body while the rest is warm (2) over a period of
several hours, (3) day after day.
Now that you are aware of the cause, watch closely the situations you place your body in each day—and
you will probably find the cause.
• Give a high catnip herb enema. It should as warm as can be taken.
• Put alternate hot and cold applications over the painful area. The cold should be very
short! This can be done for several hours at a time.
• Fomentations wrung out of mullein and lobelia, or chamomile, tea are also good.
• Place the hand and arm (which are on the opposite side of the body where the head and
neck pain is) in very hot water for 20 minutes.
• Give attention to the points mentioned above, under ""Causes.""
• Give close attention to the conditions you place your body under each day. You will
learn some interesting facts.
• Make sure the diet includes lecithin and enough calcium and magnesium.
• Get sunshine, fresh air, and exercise.
• Helpful herbs include mullein, sage, hop, plantain, valerian root, skullcap, nettle, lobelia,
black cohosh, poplar bark, and mint.
—See ""Neuralgia—2."" Also see the three most common forms of neuralgia: ""Bell's Palsy"" (also called
facial palsy); ""Sciatica;"" and ""Tic Douloureux"" (also called trigeminal neuralgia).
ENCOURAGEMENT—There is no happiness to be gained from indulgence and living for self. Your
happiness will be found in helping those around you, and obeying the Word of God. Here alone you will
find true happiness.
NEURALGIA—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
COMBAT TOXEMIA WHEN PRESENT—Sweating bath followed by appropriate general Cold

changed every 20-30 minutes. Graduated Tonic Frictions.
HERPES ZOSTER—During eruption, Dry cotton Pack; after Revulsive Compress several times daily;
Heating Compress during the interval between.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Cold applications increase pain unless very carefully graduated, but are
usually necessary for permanent results.

SYMPTOMS—A pain in the neck.
CAUSES—Working in a hunched-over position for long hours is a frequent cause. Working so that you
must lean your head forward, to better see what you are doing. But an injury may also have occurred."
disease-general-bell-s-palsy,Bell'S Palsy,"TREATMENT
• See ""Neuralgia"" for detailed information.
• Take B (1000 mcg day) for a total of 20,000 mcg; also calcium (2,000 mg day),
12
magnesium (800 mg day), and essential fatty acids.
• Make sure, when you go to bed at night, that you do not sleep so that a decided current
of cold air is blowing across your uncovered face while the rest of your body is covered
under the blankets. When this happens, the chilled part does not receive adequate rest. A
nerve in the face or neck can become chilled and cause problems.
• Apply warm, wet washcloths twice a day, for 20 minutes at a time, to relieve pain and
tenseness. Follow with gentle massage both backward and upward.
• Apply pure water to the affected eye 4 times a day, to keep it moist and free from dust.
Wearing sunglasses will reduce evaporation from that eye. Occasionally close that eye
with the finger, to rest it. Wear an eye patch at night to protect it.
• A few days later, as the muscles begin functioning again, he should exercise his facial
muscles: Standing before a mirror, wrinkle the forehead, close the affected eye, purse the
lips, move the mouth to one side and then the other, blow out the cheeks, and try to
whistle.
• Until the problem clears up, place charcoal poultices over the weakened nerve area at
night, and maintain a low-salt diet. This will help eliminate fluid released by the nerve.
• Prednisone is a drug often given, but it has negative side effects.
—Bell's palsy is a form of neuralgia; see ""Neuralgia"" for additional helpful information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Through defects in the character, Satan works to gain control of the whole
mind, and he knows that if these defects are cherished, he will succeed. It is urgent that you cling to
Christ, plead for help, and earnestly seek to do that which is pleasing in His sight.

(Facial Palsy)
SYMPTOMS—Pain in the temples and/or neck. Only one side is generally affected. There is pain,
weakness, and a sensation of pricking, tingling, or creeping on the skin. One side of the face can droop.
CAUSES—Bell's palsy is a type of paralysis characterized by distortion of the face, due to a lesion of
the facial nerve.
It may be caused by injury, irritation of a sensory nerve, or nerve root. A decayed tooth may be the
cause. Chilling of the face at night while one is sleeping can also produce it; the blood has been chilled
back from the area. Sometimes Bell's palsy follows a respiratory infection.
Bell's palsy is often mistaken for a stroke, because it comes on suddenly and results in numbness and
partial, or total, loss of muscular control on the affected side. But it is not a stroke.
Treated properly, there can be as much as 80% chance of significant recovery—all those with partial
palsy and three fourths of those with complete palsy recover with no treatment of any kind. Because
most of those with this problem recover spontaneously, they should not be given drugs or surgery.
But severe taste impairment and/or reduced tearing of the eyes are bad signs, especially in older people.
Bell's palsy can occur in anyone at any age, but most frequently occurs between 20 and 40, often in the
summer months (especially August). The younger the person is the more likely he will have a full
recovery."
disease-general-tic-douloureux,Tic Douloureux,"TREATMENT
• Keep the affected area warm. Apply hot, wet fomentations to it. Bed rest is helpful,
depending on the severity of the problem.
• A cleansing fruit juice fast for several days would enable the body to work more
effectively in solving the problem. But keep in mind that a nerve was damaged by chilling
over a lengthy period of time, so healing may not always come immediately.
• Apply warm fomentations (or warm whole baths) several times a day.
• On an ongoing basis, make sure that parts of your body are not exposed to chilling
drafts.
• The medical route is to operate on the face and destroy a nerve. This eliminates the pain,
and also permanently numbs part of the face. Some operations result in paralyzing part of
the face; you cannot know, in advance, what the operation will do to you.
—Bell's palsy is a form of neuralgia; see ""Neuralgia"" for additional helpful information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Upon obedience depends life and happiness and health and joy in this brief
probationary life. God alone can answer your problems and give you that which is for your best good.
Trust Him, and you will be safe.

(Trigeminal Neuralgia)
SYMPTOMS—There is sudden darting pain which is severe, accompanied by spasms of the muscles of
the face and tingling and burning of the skin. A slight redness and swelling of the affected side will be
seen, along with an increased flow of saliva and tears.
The affected nerves and skin become very tender; and movements of the face, speaking, and chewing
may provoke violent pain.
CAUSES—Tic douloureux is a common form of neuralgia. It generally occurs in winter.
There are three divisions of the sensory nerve of the face most likely to be affected. The first is in the
eyeball and over the forehead; the second is in the side of the face, the cheekbone, and the upper teeth;
the third is inside the mouth and in the lower teeth.
The cause of the problem is chilling of the face over a period of time, when the rest of the body is
relatively warm. The formula for trouble is (1) chilling draft to part of the body while the rest is warm
(2) over a period of several hours, (3) day after day. See ""Neuralgia"" for more on this."
disease-general-sciatica,Sciatica,"TREATMENT
• Search out the cause and try to correct it.
• Rest the painful limb in as comfortable a position as possible.
• Apply hot, wet applications to the affected leg, for the relief of pain and inflammation.
• Give prolonged applications of dry heat in any form (hot water bottles, radiant heat, or
electric heating pads).
• Apply heat in the form of hot fomentations, 3 times a day, omitting any use of ice or cold
water.
• After each application of heat, rub the limb to increase circulation.
• Carefully apply stretching exercises, but always stop before there is pain it becomes too
uncomfortable. Do each exercise 3 times, 2-3 times a day, increasing the number as
improvement occurs:
• Pull the knees up as close to the chin as possible. You will feel a pulling sensation in the
lower back.
• Sitting in a chair, reach under it as far as possible, and bend from the hip only.
• While laying on the back, the leg is raised with the knee straight. Someone else raises the
leg, bending it from the hip only. This stretches the sciatic nerve and the hamstring
muscles.
• If the attack of pain lasts so long that the leg muscles have lost considerable strength,
massage and a daily hot and cold leg bath (cold after the painful period is over) will help
to restore circulation and strength.
• There are times when a back adjustment helps. If the back is out of adjustment, this pain
can occur. You will want to weigh this possibility carefully.
• Fast one day a week, and eat only raw food for a month.
• Have a good foot massage every 3 days and especially around the Achilles tendons, up
the back of the ankles.
• Add 2 cups of salt to a boiling quart of water. When quite warm, apply with a cloth to
the area until relief comes.
• Get fresh air, sunlight, and, if possible, moderate exercise.
Also apply the preventative measures, below.
• If no improvement results from home treatments, you may wish to consult a specialist.
He is likely to tell you that an operation is necessary. Should you have an operation on
your spine? Carefully read the article, ""Backache,"" for additional information on the entire
subject.
Preventative measures: If you identify the problem early on, there may be greater likelihood of
containing or eliminating it.
• Taking vitamin B complex is very important for healthy nerves. Taking supplemental
calcium, magnesium, silica, and vitamin D for the bones is also important. Read the article
on ""Bones, Strengthening.""
• Be careful of your back when you work!
—Read ""Bones, Strengthening"" for much information. Also read ""Backache"" for detailed information on
back trouble. Also read ""Neuralgia,"" since sciatica is a form of it.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Saviour overcame to show man how he may overcome. Christ met all the
temptations of Satan with the Word of God. By trusting in God's promises, He received power to obey
God's commandments, and the tempter could gain no advantage. So it is to be with us.

SYMPTOMS—Pain is noted down the back of the thigh, the outer side of the calf and along the outer
side of the foot, or on the top of the foot to the big toe. The person compensates by placing more weight
on the other leg and foot. The pain is often worse at night and coughing, walking, heavy labor, or
sneezing increases both the pain in the back and in the sciatic nerve.
Still later, numbness may be felt when the hand is rubbed over the area where the pain is felt.
Later still, a wasting of the muscles of the calf and a weakness in running and even walking may be
noticed.
CAUSES—The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve comes out of the spine and a
branch runs down each leg, along the back of the thigh, down the inside of the leg, to the ankle.
There are two primary causes of sciatica:
The first is chilling the thigh over a lengthy period of time. The experts tell us that sciatica usually
begins as a neuralgia of the sciatic nerve. If you sit on cold surfaces a lot (steel folding chairs in cool
rooms, or steel tree chairs while hunting, or steel boat seats while fishing, etc.) for lengthy periods of
time, you can irritate the sciatic nerve and produce sciatica.
Fortunately, this form of sciatica is quite easy to solve: Apply neuralgia-type treatments, and only sit on
warm surfaces or surfaces your body can heat relatively easily. Do not overlook chairs with foam that
are too deep to easily warm up within a short time (say, 8 inches).
On your favorite chairs, place a folded, wool blanket or a piled thinner blanket. That is something you
can warm up. Experiment, and see what works best for you. If your body does not begin warming it up
in a few minutes, lay something down that will.
Unfortunately, there is a second, and much more serious, cause:
The second cause of sciatica is damage to the lower spine. There may be a history of an accident, a fall,
the lifting of a heavy weight, or a twist under some tension. Pain was first felt in the lower back. Later
(weeks or even years later) pain begins to be felt at one or more places along the entire course of the
sciatic nerve—back of the thigh, outer side of the calf, or in the top of the foot to the big toe.
One of the cartilaginous plates (disks, also spelled discs) in the lumbar region of the lower back has been
damaged. The cartilage bulges and later breaks, creating pressure backward against a nerve root. (It is
also possible for a tumor to develop and press against the sciatic nerve, but this is far less likely.)
Other important facts are these: (1) The person probably was not maintaining a nourishing diet, with
supplemental calcium, and other bone-building factors. (2) He may have been overworking his body in
running, weight-lifting, etc. (3) He was not lifting objects properly. (4) He was working at an
occupation, such as lifting heavy patients in a nursing home, which is hazardous.
In older people who do not obtain enough bone-building materials in their diet, degenerative problems
can occur in newly formed spicules, or ridges, of bone. These may press on a nerve root.
Some people derange their lower back by the simple method of always carrying a thick wallet in one
pants back pocket."
disease-general-brachial-neuralgia,Brachial Neuralgia,"TREATMENT
• Back adjustments by a competent chiropractor may be the solution.
• Keep the hands and arms warm at night, especially if there is a cool draft on the body.
• Improve the diet. A good, nourishing diet which will build the nerves and bones is
important. Raw green vegetables are needed, along with daily vitamin/mineral
supplements. A diet similar to that used in treating arthritis (which see) is helpful.
• Maintain an ongoing exercise program, to strengthen the muscles of the shoulders and
arms and improve the posture: arm lifts, neck exercises, shoulder shrugs, horizontal upper
trunk push-ups, etc. Also helpful: swimming, ball throwing, and similar activities.
• Avoid heavy lifting. When you have to lift, shrug first, and remain in a semi-shrugged
position while you lift. This will ward off nerve compression.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The rainbow of promise encircling the throne on high is an everlasting
testimony that God loves you. He will never forsake His people in their struggle with evil. We have the
assurance of strength and protection. But we can always choose to leave Him, and therein lies our
danger.
NEURITIS—1
SYMPTOMS—There may be pain, tenderness, tingling, and loss of the sensation of touch in the
affected nerve area along with redness and swelling. Pain is not always a prominent symptom of true
neuritis, but the numbness, burning, tingling, crawling, with possible pain, tends to occur by spells.
Weakness, and even paralysis and loss of sensation, are common. In serious cases, convulsions may
occur. The affected muscles may shrink in size.
CAUSES—The symptoms can vary with the cause, which can include an injury to a nerve, infection
involving a nerve, or a disease (gout, diabetes, leukemia, etc.) Poisons breathed or swallowed (mercury,
methyl alcohol, or lead) can cause nerve trouble. A lack of the vitamin B complex, especially thiamine
in the diet. A degenerative illness can produce neuritis as a side effect.
Men between the ages of 30 and 50 are the most likely to experience neuritis.
Footdrop, due to sitting with knees crossed, occurs when ankle or foot muscles weaken, causing the toes
to drag as one walks. Wrist-drop is caused by pressure in the armpit from a crutch or other support.
Optic neuritis occurs when inflammation affects the optic nerve in the eye. This can produce gradual, or
sudden, blurring and loss of vision. Blindness can occur in severe cases. But it is usually temporary if
prompt treatment is given.
• A well-balanced diet, including a full spectrum of vitamins and minerals is vital. The
entire B complex is very important. If the problem is not too far advanced, administration
of enough B complex and thiamine can bring great improvement within 3-4 days.
• If poisoning is a factor, the source of contamination must be avoided and eliminated.
Obtain an abundance of fresh air.
• Treatment for neuritis includes rest; good diet; and, after the pain subsides, massage and
careful exercise. Identify the cause and solve it.
• A fruit and vegetable juice fast for a day or two may help eliminate toxins, and thus
strengthen the body to more rapidly heal the affected nerves.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Where can we find a surer guide than the only true God? Where is a safer path
than that in which the Eternal leads the way? When we follow Him we are have powerful guidance. The
path of obedience to God is the path of virtue, of health, and happiness.
NEURITIS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
IMMEDIATE—Rest of the affected parts until the acute stage is over.
COMBAT TOXEMIA—Sweating bath 2-3 times a week, preferably the Radiant Heat Bath; follow
sweating bath by a suitable cold application.
COMBAT INFLAMMATION—Local Revulsive Compress for 15 minutes every 2-4 hours, followed
by Heating Compress during intervals between; suitable derivative applications.
PAIN—Revulsive Douche; Steam Bath followed by graduated Fan Douche, gradually lowering from
1000 to 800 F; protect by Dry cotton Pack or Heating Compress covered with plastic.
PARALYSIS—Alternate Compress; Alternate Douche; percussion Douche to spine and affected parts.
—Also see ""Neuritis—1.""

(Thoracic Outlet Syndrome)
SYMPTOMS—One to three hours after falling asleep, there is a sense of pins, needles, numbness, and
pain in one or both hands. The discomfort generally wakes the person. There may be wasting in the
small muscles in the hands, as well as coldness or swelling. It generally occurs among adults, not
children.
The symptoms can eventually include the lower arm, upper arm, and even the shoulder, and are
generally worse after a day of heavy lifting.
During the day few symptoms are present, unless heavy lifting occurs.
CAUSES—This is to the shoulder, what sciatica is to the leg. A nerve, leading to the shoulder, is
pinched in the spine.
But it can also be caused by overworking of the arms, carrying excessively heavy weights, poor posture,
and letting the arms and hands get cold at night. More rarely, there may be an abnormality in the seventh
cervical rib.
The lower branch of the brachial plexus of nerves exits from the lower cervical vertebrae, then passes
underneath the clavicle and on into the arm. If this somehow experiences compression, the nerves to the
arm and hand will be affected.
It is best to solve this problem, since it is likely otherwise to gradually keep getting worse.
A similar affliction is called the cervical rib syndrome. But it occurs more often in younger people, and
produces pain or numbness soon after heavy lifting, wearing a heavy coat, etc. The symptoms occur in
the day, not at night."
disease-general-multiple-neuritis,Multiple Neuritis,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC—Rest in bed while the disease is rapidly progressing.
COMBAT TOXEMIA—Prolonged Neutral Bath 1-2 hours, daily. Aseptic dietary; avoidance of tea
and coffee, tobacco and alcoholic liquors, and all excesses. Sweating, especially by Radiant Heat Bath,
10-20 minutes, followed by Cold Mitten Friction.
COMBAT LOCAL INFLAMMATIONS—Revulsive Compresses, then Heating Compress or packing
in dry cotton (Dry Pack); Fomentations to spine, followed by Heating Compress. When affecting the
lower extremities, Hot Footbath or Hot Leg Bath; Hot Leg Pack; complete rest of the affected part.
IMPROVE THE GENERAL NUTRITION—by Graduated Cold Baths; massage; out-of-door air with
careful protection; sunbaths; aseptic diet.
ATROPHY—Alternate Douche, massage.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—During acute stage, carefully avoid cold applications unless very short and
preceded by heat; avoid percussion applications so long as tenderness exists, that is, all forms of the
Douche. Avoid especially Cold Full Baths and very prolonged Hot Baths.

# NERVES, STRENGTHENING
BUILDING UP THE NERVES—Good blood, healthy nerves, and strong bones and joints are needed
for good health. Here are several suggestions, to help you strengthen your nerves. This is a building
program:
The vitamin B complex (100 mg per day; best taken as 50 mg twice a day) is especially important in
maintaining good nerve action and response. Deficiencies of the B complex are common among people
eating modern, devitalized, processed, and assorted junk foods. Take a good vitamin/mineral supplement
at least twice a day. It should include all the B vitamins.
Vitamin B , also called thiamine (100 mg, twice a day) is especially needed for neuritis.
1
Vitamin B (niacin, 50 mg twice a day). Do not take more than 100 mg of niacin a day. Niacinamide is
3
equivalent to niacin, and does not produce the flushed face which niacin does.
Vitamin B (2,000 mcg, twice a day).
12
Vitamin B (250-500 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for carpal tunnel syndrome.
6
Folic acid (400-800 mcg, daily).
Inositol (1000 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for diabetic neuropathy.
In addition to the above B vitamins, also take Vitamin C with bioflavonoids (3,000-6,000 mg daily,
when you have a nerve crisis).
Vitamin E (400 IU, 2-3 times a day), especially with post-herpes syndrome.
Vitamin A (5,000 IU, a day), but not over 10,000 IU a day if you are pregnant. It is best to take vitamin
A supplementation in the form of beta-carotene.
Minerals include calcium (400 mg, 2-3 times daily), magnesium (200 mg, 2-3 times a day), zinc (50-80
mg daily, not to exceed 100 mg daily from all supplements), and iodine.
Essential fatty acids, obtained from 1-2 tbsp. of cold pressed oils daily. Never put it into your cooking;
instead, put it on your food after the plate is served.
Fresh and steamed vegetables are rich in minerals which are needed for the nervous system and brain.
Brewer's yeast, kelp or dulse, lecithin, and wheat germ oil are very helpful. Eat regularly, chew slowly,
and do not overeat.
Octocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.
Increase your fluid intake.
Obtain enough rest at night and avoid sexual enervation. Medical professionals know that such
enervation is one of the quickest ways to produce weakened, degenerate, and diseased nerve tissue.
A good balance between exercise and rest has a powerful effect in building the body, if a nutritious diet
is maintained.
Avoid stimulants and all processed, refined, and junk foods.
Cool and cold water treatments will help tone and strengthen the nerves.
The nervine herbs include skullcap, hop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, passion flower,
lady's slipper, mistletoe, and small amounts of lobelia.
Reviewing some of the nutrients needed, as they apply to the brain, we learn this:
There is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is clogged, mental
illness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in others.
Eliminate the ""glue foods""; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous and toxins in it,
and lead to mental problems. Such foods include White flour, sugar, eggs, meat, peanuts, and dairy
products.
A high carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the brain, and produces
a calming, peaceful feeling.
Brain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients.
Deficiencies of the B complex and vitamin C decrease the metabolic rate of the brain. Lack of niacin can
produce deep depression, often seen in psychosis. Symptoms of a severe vitamin B deficiency are
6
headache, irritability, dizziness, extreme nervousness, and inability to concentrate. Pantothenic acid
(another B vitamin) is needed to handle stressful situations. A thiamine deficiency results in a lack of
energy, constant fatigue, loss of appetite, and irritability; if this continues too long, there are emotional
upsets and overreaction to normal stress. Lack of vitamin C leads to irritability.
Adequate calcium in the diet is vital. See ""Bones, Strengthening"" for ways to maintain enough calcium
in the body. Inadequate calcium results in insomnia, tenseness, and fatigue.
Calcium and magnesium protect the nerves from damage.
Too much copper in the body occurs in schizophrenia, and can be reduced by dietary intake of zinc and
manganese. Vitamin C deficiency can cause copper retention which accumulates in the brain and liver.
Vitamin B complex (especially B , B , B and folic acid) reduces excess estrogen from the liver and
3 6 12,
prevents it from causing mental troubles.
Many of the schizophrenias, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning disorders are caused
by too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes. Plastic water pipes are the safest.
A person with a magnesium deficiency tends to be uncooperative, withdraw, apathetic, or belligerent.
It is vital to obtain enough oxygen, if you want a clear mind which functions properly. Vitamin E helps
the brain obtain enough oxygen from the amount supplied to the lungs.
A lack of thyroxine, the hormone from the thyroid, results in a slowing of physical and mental functions.
Hyperthyroidism is related to emotional disturbance, forgetfulness, slow thought processes, and
irritability.
When the adrenals do not function properly, depression and other forms of mental illness may result.
Exercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps rejuvenate the body
and mind.
Ginkgo biloba improves brain function and cerebral circulation, and enhances memory.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We have been bought with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without
blemish. What a price has been paid for us! Now Christ invites you to come and accept the salvation
which He alone can work out in your life. He can strengthen you to obey all that He asks of you."
disease-general-seasonal-affective-syndrome,Seasonal Affective Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• In most cases, an improvement in diet will greatly help. Foods rich in the B complex are
needed, along with fresh fruit and vegetables. The nervous system needs to be built up
with better food.
• Negative attitudes are also powerful. Train your mind to be thankful for the blessings
you have.
• If possible, obtain a full-spectrum light for your dining room and work area.
ENCOURAGEMENT—To those who love God, it will be the highest delight to keep His
commandments and to do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

SYMPTOMS—Withdrawal, social isolation, depression, cravings, weight gain, loss of energy,
oversleep, decreased sexual desire.
CAUSES—This condition, also called the ""winter blues"", is caused by several factors:
The winter months bring dark and dreary overcast days, and this emotionally bothers some people more
than others.
The winter months have shorter hours of daylight and more overcast skies during the daytime, resulting
in less light entering the eyes. This light deficiency sends signals to the pineal, pituitary, and
hypothalamus glands; and they do not function as fully as usual.
There is often more stress and greater nutritional deficiencies in the winter. Less fresh fruit and
vegetables may be available.
All this combines, in some, to produce seasonal affective syndrome. In our waking hours, we need
sunlight every so often. We have a friend who, moving to Labrador, on the eastern Canadian coast,
could not tolerate the incessant dreary fog, and moved away within a year."
disease-general-tennis-elbow,Tennis Elbow,"TREATMENT
• For 3-4 days, do not do the types of activities which cause the pain.
• Apply cold or hot to the affected area, according to which helps you best: Apply ice on
the affected area for 30-90 minutes each day; the more the pain, the longer the application.
Or apply heat, especially after the first few day.
• Careful exercise is also needed, to eliminate tennis elbow; rest is not enough. The
tendons need to be strengthened. Purchase a hand gripper at a sporting goods store, and
slowly increase your usage of it until you are using it 5-10 minutes, 4 times a day. When
you use it, the elbow should be straight and the wrist bent. This will stretch the extensor
tendons and help strengthen the fibrous tendons.
• Other exercises are also helpful. Place your forearm on a table, palm down, and grip a 3-
pound dumbbell. Flex the wrist upward slightly; hold for 5 seconds, lower and rest for 3
seconds. When you can easily do this 15 times, increase the weight by 1 pound. Over a
period of 4-6 weeks of doing this every day, you may be able to move up to 8-10 pounds
lifted without pain. Medical Tribune (January 12, 1977) reported that 14 of 18 patients, on
a four-week program with this exercise, obtained complete pain relief.
• Athletes sometimes place a band several inches wide around the forearm near the elbow,
and another just above the wrist. Be sure they are not too tight.
• Avoid cortisone injections, for these can produce tendon atrophy or even dissolve it!
—Also see ""Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Satan and his evil angels are watching at every avenue leading to the human
heart, seeking to force souls to accept evil suggestions. He presents us with bribes, as he bribed Christ;
pretending that he will give us the world if we will obey him. But, in the strength of Christ, we must
resist him.

SYMPTOMS—Tenderness and pain in the elbow, weakness in the hand.
CAUSES—Tennis elbow is an occupational and recreational problem. Those who do a lot of hand-
gripping can have this disorder. This would include golfers, carpenters, factory workers, housewives,
and even politicians who shake hands a lot.
The weakness occurs when gripping an object, and is not a true muscle weakness. The tendons are
involved."
disease-general-carpal-tunnel-syndrome,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• As soon as the tingling begins, begin doing some gentle hand exercises. Rotate the wrist
in a circle for 2 minutes. This exercises all the muscles of the wrist, restores circulation,
and gets your wrist out of the position that usually causes the trouble.
• Raise your hands above your head and rotate your arms while rotating your wrists at the
same time. Also do some neck turns; look over your right, then left, shoulder. Learn to
exercise and relax as you work.
• Vitamin B helps eliminate the problem.
6
• Eat half a fresh pineapple daily, for 1-3 weeks. The bromelain in it will reduce swelling
and pain.
• Eat only moderate amounts of oxalic acid foods (beets, beet greens, sorrel, Swiss chard,
cabbage family, eggs, parsley, asparagus.). Avoid spinach, and especially rhubarb. Fish
have oxalic acid also.
• Avoid salt and all sodium foods, for they promote water retention.
• Try to reduce the impact of repetitive mechanical tasks on your wrists and hands. If
possible, stop all such movements for several days and see if improvement occurs. If so,
try to do these functions less frequently. If possible, rotate your duties, so you do not do
those repetitive tasks every day.
• Keep your weight down. Extra weight puts more pressure on the carpal tunnel.
• Keep your arms close to your body and your wrists straight while sleeping. For example,
if you let your hand drop over the side of the bed while you are sleeping, the pressure on
the median nerve is increased.
• You might wish to temporarily wear a wrist splint at night. This helps keep the wrist
straight.
• Do not wrap your wrist in an Ace bandage. This could cut off the circulation.
• If you have to carry something, make the sure the handle is the right size. If it is too
small or large, it could hurt your wrist.
• Aloe vera, yarrow, and yucca help restore flexibility and reduce inflammation. Skullcap
relieves muscle spasms and pain. Wintergreen oil reduces pain and aids circulation to the
muscles.
PREVENTION—Carpal tunnel syndrome is a problem which many can develop in our time. Here are
several suggestions for avoiding its occurrence:
• Use a tool instead of flexing your wrists forcibly.
• Use your whole hand and all your fingers when you grip an object.
• In doing a task, use your whole arm, not just your wrist. For example, when hammering,
swing your arm rather than just your wrist.
• Maintain good posture and keep your elbows bent when typing, writing, etc. What is the
ideal position? Cock your wrist back slightly, so that your thumb is parallel to your
forearm. Your hand should be in approximately the same position as if it were holding a
pen. This position keeps the carpal tunnel as open as possible. Place a wrist pad on the
table, just in front of the keyboard.
• Before starting handwork, exercise the fingers and wrists for a couple minutes, to warm
them up. Take a break from handwork every hour. Shake out your hands every so often
throughout the day.

ENCOURAGEMENT—The wrath of God will not fall upon one soul that seeks refuge in Him. God
cares for His children who trust in Him. They may have trials in this life, but their life is secure and they
will live with their Maker in heaven.
Section 9
Nervous-Mental
Part 3
Convulsions

SYMPTOMS—Mild numbness and faint tingling to excruciating pain, but generally only burning,
tingling, or numbness in the thumb and first three fingers. Crippling atrophy of the thumb can result.
Symptoms are often worse at night or in the morning. The pain may eventually spread to the arm and
shoulder. Symptoms normally affect only one hand, but may be present in both.
CAUSES—Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a cumulative trauma disorder that develops over time, due
to repeated stressful movements of the hands and wrist. It affects 23,000 workers a year. The median
nerve in the wrist is compressed or damaged. This nerve controls the thumb muscles and sensation in the
thumb, palm, and first three fingers. The median nerve passes through a very small opening, about a
quarter inch below the top of the wrist.
Either compression or injury to this nerve can cause problems: Pressure from the bone spurs
inflammatory arthritis or tendonitis, swelling due to pregnancy or water retention.
Other causes include repeated stressful motions, such as writing, typing, or hammering. Bookkeepers
and checkout clerks can develop it; so can hairstylists, musicians, writers, drivers, athletes, restaurant
servers, and jack hammer and chain-saw operators. The occurrence of CTS has greatly increased since
the 1980s, when personal computers came into use. The tendons swell and compress the median nerve
that runs to your hand, causing great pain. A common pattern is rapid and continuous use of the fingers,
producing a repetitive wrist motion injury. Women between 29 and 62 experience CTS more often than
anyone else.
Raynaud's disease, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and menopause increase the risk of developing
CTS.
Other disorders, especially arthritis in the neck, have similar symptoms. But, if the first three fingers in
one or both hands are affected by the pain, then it is probably CTS."
disease-general-convulsions,Convulsions,"TREATMENT
• Loosen the clothing and give plenty of fresh air. If the cause is undetermined, keep him
from injuring himself. Place a soft pad between his teeth, to avoid biting his tongue or
cheeks.
• If an infant, put him in a bath of 95o F. or in mustard and water bath at 85o F. Cold
should be applied to the head. The cause must first be found, or injury may result from the
bath. If fever is present, it should be a tepid or cool bath.
• Produce vomiting by placing the finger down the throat. If gums are hot and swollen,
give cold water and rub gums with a cloth that has been held on ice.
• The bowels should be emptied immediately with an enema. Take some laxative herbs, to
clean out the small intestine. Fast on fruit juices, water, or nervine herb teas (listed below)
until all symptoms subside. Keep the body warm.
• After this, rest in bed, absolutely quiet; give careful diagnosis without disturbing him.
• One successful method of therapy has been the injection in 1 large dose of 600,000 IU of
vitamin D. This helps the utilization of calcium.
• Take calcium (2,000 mg, daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg, daily) supplements. Also B
6
(100 mg, twice a day) and chromium (75-100 mcg, 3 times a day).
• Helpful herbs include catnip, skullcap, and peony. Two cups of valerian root may be
taken every 2 hours after the convulsions. Antispasmodic tincture (which see) is best and
works faster.
• Other useful herbs include rue, black cohosh, valerian, vervain, peppermint, chamomile,
wild cherry bark, goldenseal, and a little cayenne.
• One Central American naturopath says that, over the years, he has treated a thousand
cases of convulsions—and fully one-half were caused by parasites. Other important
causes are constipation and wrong diet. He puts them on a cleansing and building
program, discarding all meat eating, and requiring that they never return to it (so they will
not again become infested with worms).
• If parasites are the cause, use garlic enemas, plus eat garlic (see ""Worms"" for more
information).
• There is a definite possibility, especially in children, that a food allergy is involved, very
possibly accompanied by malnutrition (maybe partially caused by being fed too much
junk food and soft drinks). After the convulsion is past, begin testing with pulse tests for
food allergies (see ""Pulse Test"").
• If it should be a spasm of asthma, take 8 drops of antispasmodic tincture (which see) or
inhale eucalyptus oil.
• If it is a muscle spasm, wring a towel out of hot water and lay it on the area.
• A coughing spasm can be relieved by the tincture or an emetic.

ENCOURAGEMENT—The psalmist says, ""The law of the Lord is perfect."" How wonderful, in its
simplicity and comprehensiveness, is the Ten Commandments! In Christ's strength we can obey it;
whereas, apart from Him, we cannot.
EPILEPSY—1
SYMPTOMS—There are several types of, what are called, seizures:
Absence (petit mal): A blank stare lasting about half a minute, and the person is unaware of his
surroundings. Most often in children.
Complex partial (temporal lobe): A blank stare, random activity, and a chewing motion. No memory of
this seizure afterward. An aura, or warning indication, may occur before. It may be a certain odor,
sound, thought, etc. No after memory of the seizure.
Myoclonuc: Brief but massive muscle jerks.
Simple partial (Jacksonian): Jerking begins in the fingers and toes, and progresses throughout the body.
The person remains conscious.
Simple partial (sensory): Things that do not exist are seen, heard, or sensed. A general seizure may
follow.
CAUSES—Epilepsy is defined as an episodic disturbance of consciousness, during which generalized
convulsions may occur. There are recurring seizures, generally one of seven patterns (listed above). This
is caused by electrical disturbances, in the nerve cells, in a portion of the brain.
Electroencephalographic studies reveal a direct relationship between changes in electrical brain
potentials and the occurrence of seizures.
Epilepsy is the most common form of seizures, also called convulsions or fits. Epilepsy can be caused by
injury to the head, neck, or spinal cord, especially before or during birth. High fevers during early
childhood or infectious diseases can also cause it. Heredity can be involved. Oxygen deprivation at birth
or a later head injury may be causal factors.
A variety of factors may trigger the onset of a seizure. Oddly enough, an important one is constipation in
the transverse colon. Eating bread, especially soft bread, is known to lead to seizures.
An improperly functioning ileocecal valve is a possible cause. This permits powerful toxins to enter the
blood stream and affect the delicate nervous system and brain.
During a seizure, the person may fall during the attack, often injuring himself; he may bite his tongue,
pass urine, and awake to realize something has happened because of muscular soreness.
There is a tendency to sleep following the attack. Sometimes attacks occur only during sleep.
Some seizures take the form of antisocial or unnatural conduct.
On recovery, amnesia is generally complete, so no effort is made to hide what happened. The epileptic
may gradually deteriorate.
IMMEDIATE TREATMENT—During the attack, arrange the head to facilitate breathing. Prevent the
tongue from being bitten or from obstructing the windpipe. Place a pad between the teeth during the
attack. Afterward allow him to sleep.
Comments from a reader: I am writing in regards to your section on Epilepsy, under which you have
stated: ""During the attack, arrange the head to facilitate breathing. Prevent the tongue from being bitten
or from obstructing the windpipe. Place a pad between the teeth during the attack. Afterward allow him
to sleep.""
Although a common belief is that a person can swallow his/her tongue during a seizure, or that the
tongue can obstruct the windpipe, this is not true. During a seizure, the afflicted person's body will
stiffen and convulse - resulting in biting of the tongue. It is therefore not advised that anything be placed
in the person's mouth, as that may cause further damage, but instead to place the person on his/her side.
Additionally, if by ""arrange the head"" you were referring to turning the person onto his/her side, I would
ask that you please clarify as it is currently vague and unclear. First Aid instructions from the Epilepsy
Foundation are listed below. I do hope you can update this information so viewers will not be
misinformed. -Keep calm and reassure other people who may be nearby. -Don't hold the person down or
try to stop his movements. -Time the seizure with your watch. -Clear the area around the person of
anything hard or sharp. -Loosen ties or anything around the neck that may make breathing difficult. -Put
something flat and soft, like a folded jacket, under the head. -Turn him or her gently onto one side. This
will help keep the airway clear. Do not try to force the mouth open with any hard implement or with
fingers. It is not true that a person having a seizure can swallow his tongue. Efforts to hold the tongue
down can injure teeth or jaw. -Don't attempt artificial respiration except in the unlikely event that a
person does not start breathing again after the seizure has stopped. -Stay with the person until the seizure
ends naturally. -Be friendly and reassuring as consciousness returns. -Offer to call a taxi, friend or
relative to help the person get home if he seems confused or unable to get home by himself. Thank you
for your time and cooperation. Sincerely, Debbie Fiore
See ""Convulsions"" for more information on dealing with them.
PREVENTING SEIZURES—Do not eat soft bread; better yet, do not eat any bread. You may find that
you should not eat mush either.
Keep the colon clean. Take enemas or colonics weekly if necessary. Pressure from a clogged colon can
press against the ileocecal valve and release toxins which are absorbed by the bloodstream.
If the bowels do not move each day, take a lemon enema (juice of 2 lemons in 2 quarts water) before
going to bed that night.
Drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices.
Include raw vegetables in your diet.
Check your diet with pulse and other tests, to see which foods are a problem. Use rotation diets to this
objective. (See ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test."")
Avoid white sugar and white-flour products. Avoid fried foods, animal protein, and artificial sweeteners.
Maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Do not overeat! Do not take in excess amounts of food or fluid
at one time.
Take manganese supplementation. A lack of it can produce epilepsy. Women who lack it can give birth
to epileptic children.
Vitamin B deficiency has been linked as a factor in some cases of epilepsy. When given to some
6
babies, in their formula, the epilepsy ceased.
Deficiencies of vitamins A, D, folic acid, zinc, and aurine (an amino acid) are also involved.
Magnesium deficiency may cause muscle tremors and convulsive seizures. Epileptics have a lower than
normal amount of this mineral. Infants with excess calcium intake had a magnesium loss. Yet other
studies revealed that calcium was also important.
Avoid alcohol, caffeine, pesticides, and aluminum cookware. High levels of aluminum have been found
in the brains of those with epilepsy. Aluminum is a conductor of electricity, and trace amounts in the
brain may trigger seizures.
Toxic metals (lead, copper, mercury, and aluminum) are known to cause seizure. Hypoglycemia is
linked to convulsions. Serum glucose levels fall just before a seizure.
The artificial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) has been linked to seizures. Beware of lead poisoning
also.
Allergies cause seizures in some. This includes chemicals, pesticides, food additives, or common foods
such as peanuts.
Doses of folic acid, in excess of 400 mcg per day, can trigger seizures.
Have a hair analysis done, to see if a metal toxicity could be involved as a causal factor.
In some instances, a ketogentic diet is prescribed; but, if used, it should be under the guidance of
someone who understands how to apply it: This diet is keyed to restricting protein and carbohydrate
intake, increasing fat intake, and producing acid levels in the bloodstream which act to inhibit brain
stimulation of seizures.
Avoid the herb, sage. This herb should not be used by anyone with a tendency to seizures.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Unless we depend on a power outside of ourselves, Satan will succeed in
accomplishing our ruin. In looking to Jesus and obeying His Word you will be safe.
EPILEPSY—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC FACTORS—Abstemious, dry, aseptic dietary, chiefly fruits and grains; vigorous out-of-door
exercise to the extent of fatigue daily. Prolonged Neutral Bath daily; sweating process 2-3 times a week;
graduated cold procedures (Tonic Frictions), avoiding prolonged and intense applications. [Avoid
constipation in the transverse colon: this is a key factor in avoiding attacks. Avoid doughy foods that
tend to constipation.]
WHEN ATTACK IS THREATENED—Colonic twice daily; copious water drinking; Neutral Pack;
ice to head; rest in bed. Seizure may sometimes be averted by placing the part in cold water.
AFTER ATTACK—Rest; cold to head; Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub; Half Bath; Revulsive
Douche to legs; and percussion Douche to spine.
GENERAL METHOD—Train him to a vigorous regimen; a simple abstemious dietary, abundance of
outdoor exercise; the daily employment of the Prolonged Neutral Bath, followed by short, moderate cold
applications; copious water drinking; regulation of all the vital functions, avoiding all sources of nervous
irritation and exhaustion.
—Also see ""Epilepsy—1.""
# ANTISPASMODIC TINCTURE
WHAT IT IS—A tincture is an extract made from herbs by soaking them in alcohol. (Only grain
alcohol should be used for internal use; wood alcohol, such as rubbing alcohol, will cause blindness.)
The resultant mixture does not spoil.
Then when a spasm occurs, only a very small amount is given to the person, and he generally pulls out
of the crisis quickly.
Antispasmodic tincture is used for all spasms or attacks such as those of the heart, asthma, cough,
epilepsy, or shock.
HOW TO PREPARE IT—This formula has been used, for decades by veteran naturopaths, with great
success. Here is the formula:
One-half ounce cayenne pepper and 1 ounce of each of the following herbs: skullcap, skunk cabbage
root or seed, gum myrrh, lobelia seed (or the plant if the seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root.
Mix each of the above together while dry and put into a large-mouth jar. Add 1 pint pure grain alcohol
of 70-100 proof. Eighty proof Vodka works fine because it is tasteless.
(An alternative to alcohol is to, instead, use 1 pint of apple cider vinegar. Store in the same manner.)
Let this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shake well, daily.
At the end of that time, strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all you can. Store it in a tightly
capped bottle. Also put some into a small dropper bottle.
In a crisis, it is given in 8-10 drop doses. It can be squirted into the mouth or taken in a tbsp. of water. (If
stored in vinegar, give in teaspoonful doses, not drops. Its effects are not quite as rapid.)
As a cough syrup for children, prepare it in this way: Pour 1 quart water over the herbs. Let it stand for 1
hour, then strain. Add 1 pint honey. Place it over low heat and let it evaporate to the equivalent of 3
cupfuls. Pour this hot syrup into hot baby-food jars and seal for future use. Give it in teaspoonful doses
for cough, asthma, convulsions, or insomnia.
Jethro Kloss mentions a man who was released from clenched lockjaw by a small application of
antispasmodic tincture.
When the case is severe, especially with an infant, the tincture can be rubbed onto the chest, neck, and
between the shoulders. Place 2-3 drops in the mouth, and wash down with teaspoon doses of warm water
while the person is kept in bed. If necessary, repeat every 1-2 hours.
There are six herbs in the formula. The lobelia is the active agent in relaxing the muscles and
normalizing breathing. The cayenne pepper warms, stimulates, and reduces inflammation. The skullcap
and valerian soothe the nerves and keep small vessels from rupturing. The skunk cabbage and gum
myrrh aids in reducing infection.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Our Lord is pleading for us in the presence of the Father at the throne of grace
in heaven. He is our only hope. Our faith looks up to Him, grasps Him as the One able to save to the
uttermost, and we are accepted by the Father.

Paralysis
LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE—1
(Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)
SYMPTOMS—Progressive muscular weakness and atrophy, weakened respiratory muscles (which can
result in pneumonia), difficulty chewing and swallowing, stiffness, cramping, and involuntary quivering
of small muscles.
CAUSES—Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease, resulting in
muscular atrophy.
Causes include heredity (10% of the cases) or strenuous physical work in one's occupation, combined
with nutritional deficiencies (especially vitamins B complex, E, F, and C). Other factors include viral
infections, physical exhaustion, and trauma.
Heavy metals, ingested or inhaled, can induce damage to the nervous system.
• A nourishing diet, which includes complete vitamin/mineral supplementation, plus fresh
fruits, vegetables, and vegetable juices.
• A vitamin E deficiency is a special factor inducing ALS.
• Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and silicon are also needed.
• Flaxseed (or, secondarily, wheat germ oil) is essential.
• Avoid dairy products, meat, sugar, and white- flour products. This will accelerate
healing.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God's Ten Commandment law is so brief that we can easily memorize it, yet
so far-reaching as to express the whole will of God for our lives. Thank God that there is a moral
standard in our world, whether men like it or not.

(Spasms, Seizures, Fits)
SYMPTOMS—Paroxysms of involuntary muscular contractions and relaxations, which occur most
frequently in children.
CAUSES—Convulsions are uncontrolled body movements set off by an electrical malfunction of the
brain.
Convulsions can be caused by epilepsy, meningitis, tetanus, uremia, hysteria, or eclampsia. They can
also be induced by poisoning from camphor, cyanide, strychnine, santonin, brucine, or aspidium.
In children the cause is often wrong diet, rickets, syphilis, malaria, toxemias, or acute infectious
diseases.
In adults, the cause is often epilepsy, heat cramps, strychnine, or food poisoning.
Convulsions, due to tetanus and hydrophobia, are easily distinguished and, for the most part, involve a
small portion of the voluntary muscles. Strychnine poisoning causes spasms which involve the whole
body.
High fevers of 104o-105o F. are often a cause of convulsions in children."
disease-general-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,
Formulas)
BASIC APPLICATIONS—Prolonged Neutral Baths, 1-3 hours daily; massage.
GENERAL METHOD—Build up the general health by gentle tonic measures, slowly increased in
intensity, suppressing the formation of toxic substances and promoting their elimination by a suitable
dietary, improvement of digestion and the employment of the other measures indicated above.
By the suppression of the active causes of the disease and the adoption of better means for the
improvement of general nutrition and especially of the nutrition of the spinal cord, it is usually possible
to arrest the disease; and, not infrequently, a considerable degree of improvement may be secured.
Therapeutic measures must be most thoroughly and perseveringly employed. The progress of the disease
may be delayed, even when it cannot be altogether arrested.

disease-general-locomotor-ataxia,Locomotor Ataxia,"TREATMENT
• Meningitis can progress quickly and become life threatening in 24 hours for adults, and
even quicker for children. Call a physician.
• Rest in bed in a dimly lit room. Drink plenty of clean liquids. Take cool sponge baths, if
there is fever.
• If untreated, permanent brain damage and possible paralysis can result.
• Drink citrus juices, from lemons, oranges, and limes.
• For fever, use catnip tea enemas. The tea can also be sipped.
• Goldenseal is a natural antibiotic. Echinacea boosts the immune system.
• It is best not to eat food during the acute phase. Eating food stops the elimination of
toxins from the tissues, so that digestion can begin. This causes the toxins to be thrown
still deeper into the system.
• When the acute phase is ended and recovery is beginning, eat a nourishing diet of fruits
and vegetables. Fresh pineapple helps reduce the infection.
• Avoid meat, dairy products, caffeine, and salt. Avoid processed, sugared, and white-
flour foods.
• If there are no complications, recovery usually takes three weeks under a physician's
care.
• Remember: Meningitis is contagious. Those caring for a person with this disease must be
very careful, and be sure to obtain adequate rest.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ calls to you, ""Choose you this day whom ye will serve."" There is
necessity for a decided choice, for Jesus said, ""You cannot serve God and mammon."" We cannot have

MENINGITIS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL—Careful Cold Mitten Friction, 2-4 times daily.
COMBAT CONGESTION OF THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD—Ice Cap; Ice Collar; Cooling
Compress to the head; Ice Bag to the spine; general derivative treatments, such as Hot Hip Packs and
Hot Leg Packs; Hot Blanket Pack; Hot Full Bath at 1020F. The head should be protected by the Ice Cap,
or Ice Collar, during all hot applications. Fomentation to the spine every 2 hours. Spinal Ice Bag during
intervals between. Vigorous skin circulation must be maintained (see ""general,"" just above).
PREVENT BRONCHITIS—Fomentation to the chest twice daily; well-protected Heating Compress
during interval between. Keep shoulders dry and well-protected while in bed. In Cold Bath, see that the
water covers the shoulders. The Chest Compress must cover the shoulders.
HEADACHE—Fomentation to the back of the neck, Ice Compress to head and neck, Hot and Cold
Head Compress.
PAIN IN BACK AND LEGS—Fomentation to back; Hot Hip Pack. Repeat every 4 hours or more
often. Heating Compress or Ice Bag during interval between.
VOMITING—Ice Bag over stomach; Hot and Cold Trunk.
DIARRHEA—Enema at 950 F. after each movement. During interval between, give Cold Abdominal
Compress at 600 F., renewed every 15 minutes with Fomentations to the abdomen for 15 minutes, every
2 hours.
MUSCULAR RIGIDITY—Hot Blanket Pack; Hot Full Bath; Hot Fomentation, followed by well-
protected Heating Compress.
HYPERESTHESIA—Neutral Bath at 940-960F.
DELIRIUM OR MANIA—Prolonged Wet Sheet Pack, Ice cap, or Ice Collar.
MUSCULAR SPASM—Hot Full Bath at 1020 F. for 15-30 minutes, with Ice Cap and Ice Collar.
Prolonged Neutral Bath. Heating Spinal Compress.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Do not use Cold Full Baths and other general cold procedures.
GENERAL METHOD—The object to be sought, by treatment, is to relieve congestion of the brain and
spinal cord by diverting as much blood as possible into the skin hence the skin must be kept constantly
warm. General cold procedures, such as the Cold Full Bath and the Cooling Pack must be avoided.
Undue excitement of the brain and spinal cord during hot applications is prevented by protecting these
parts by Ice Compresses and the application of an Ice Bag over the heart. Partial cold applications, as
Cold Mitten Friction, should be administered several times daily to maintain vital resistance, care being
taken to maintain surface warmth by the application of heat to the spine and legs or other parts during
the treatment so as to avoid retrostasis.

MENINGITIS—1
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms vary considerably, but usually include a sore throat, fever, headache, stiff
neck, and vomiting. Children and adults can become critically ill in 6-24 hours after the first appearance
of the symptoms. This condition requires rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Take him to the
emergency room immediately! Demand immediate help!
Symptoms include sore throat, red or purple skin rash, fever, chills, malaise, headaches, vomiting,
sensitivity to light, nausea, delirium, stiff neck, and convulsions.
In infants: vomiting, fever, difficult feeding, irritability, a high-pitched cry, a bulging fontanel (soft spot
on top of the head). Changes in temperament and extreme sleepiness indicate dangerous changes in
cerebrospinal fluid.
Warning: A child can be hurt when he is picked up.
CAUSES—Meningitis is an inflammation of the two membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.
They are called the meninges. In addition, the thin membranes that cover the spinal cord may also be
infected. It is a contagious disease.
Causes include several different viruses (including those causing polio, measles, rubella, fungi, yeast
infection) and several types of bacteria.
Infection can spread from the nose and throat to the meninges. A depleted immune system (along with
nose and throat trouble) can cause it to enter the blood stream and go to the brain.
If not treated properly, a case of flu or ear, nose, and throat infections can develop into meningitis.
Eating heavy meals or taking drugs while sick can cause an infection to drive deeper into the system and
enter the brain area.
Other factors aiding in the development of meningitis are alcoholism, brain surgery, brain cancer,
exposure to chemical agents, head injury, pneumonia, Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, or anything
that weakens the immune system (chemotherapy, radiation treatment, steroid therapy, HIV infection,
and certain types of cancer).
Of the three main types of meningitis, viral infection is more common and produces milder symptoms,
such as malaise and headache, which generally clears up on its own in a week or two.
But the bacterial type requires prompt, aggressive treatment—or brain damage or death can result. (Any
time a bacterial infection occurs [such as strep throat or an ear infection], eliminate it; do not ignore the
problem.)
Fungal meningitis progresses more slowly, but also requires medical care.
Do not guess! Call a physician!
Meningitis is more common in children than adults."
disease-general-meningocele,Meningocele,"(Spina Bifida; Severe Anencephalia)
SYMPTOMS—A severe birth defect.
CAUSES—We cannot provide you with solutions once this occurs. We can only tell you what would
have prevented it.
This severe birth defect results in exposure of the brain or spinal cord and its coverings (meninges)
because of the improper formation of the vertebrae.
Death may result. Medical treatment is limited to surgery
PREVENTION—This birth defect is caused by a deficiency of folic acid, B , zinc, or vitamin A
12
during early pregnancy.
These deficiencies may be the result of poor and inadequate nutrition or intestinal malabsorption
problems in the mother.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ's glory is concerned in our success. When, by faith in Him, we live for
Him and obey Him, we honor and glorify Him. What a thought is this! He is our sympathizing Saviour.

• Give this vital trace mineral (copper) to the child (copper IV, at 200 ug/kg/day).
• Also deal with the malabsorption problems by taking the infant or child off wheat, cow's
milk, and soy milk.
• Give copper orally at 1-2 mg per day, after elimination of symptoms.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If your heart is filled with love for Christ, it will be shown that He is stronger
than the passions which have ruled you in the past, whose indulgence undermined noble impulses and
left the soul to the mercy of Satan's temptations. When the heart of the sinner is touched, he yields his
will to God's will.

SYMPTOMS—Kinky, sparse, and brittle hair. Loss of hair color, arterial aneurysms, scurvy-like bone
disease (ostosis), and progressive brain degeneration.
CAUSES—The current theory is that it is a genetic disease, but it is actually a malabsorption problem in
early infancy.
Celiac disease (primarily from feeding the infant wheat at too early an age; see Celiac Disease) can
produce a copper deficiency, along with other deficiencies."
disease-general-multiple-sclerosis,Multiple Sclerosis,"TREATMENT
• Give attention to solving as many of the above possible problems as possible.
• Eat a nourishing diet with supplemental vitamins and minerals. Fruit and vegetable
juices are important.
• Avoid meat, milk, eggs, dairy products, and caffeine.
• Avoid sugar, excess fat, white-flour, rancid oils, fried foods; all of which are able to
destroy nerve cells.
• The mercury fillings in your teeth may be a factor. The levels of mercury in people with
MS are seven times higher than those in other people. Get rid of your mercury fillings, if
you have any symptoms of MS.
• Massage and regular exercise are helpful. Keep mentally active.
• Avoid stress and anxiety; they can bring on attacks.
• Short fasts are helpful.
• Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used successfully in some other countries (outside
the U.S.).
• Helpful herbs include ginkgo, suma, gotu kola, kelp, hop, chamomile, skullcap, and
valerian.
ENCOURAGEMENT—There is no mystery in the law of God. All can comprehend the great truths
which it embodies. Everyone can grasp its rules. Obedience to the law is essential, not only to our
salvation, but to our own happiness and the happiness of all with whom we are connected. But only in
Christ's enabling strength can we render that obedience.

SYMPTOMS—Earlier stages: occasional dizziness, mood swings or depression, numbness in the
fingers and feet, weakness in the hands and feet, loss of balance, nausea and vomiting, muscular
stiffness, tremors, slurred speech, and difficult breathing. Later stages: difficulty in walking, a staggering
gait. Later still: spastic movements, paralysis, extreme fatigue, and bowel and bladder incontinence.
Symptoms flare up, and then nearly disappear for a time. Yet the problem keeps worsening, over a
matter of weeks, but sometimes slowly over decades.
CAUSES—Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the central nervous
system. The nerves are covered with a coating called myelin. MS destroys this covering, leaving scar
tissue (called plaques) in its place. Eventually the nerves themselves become sclerotic (hardened) and
stop functioning.
Possible causes include an autoimmune attacking by the white blood cells of the myelin sheaths;
malnutrition or poor diet; stress; possible food allergies (dairy products or gluten); metal poisoning
(lead, mercury, etc.); chemicals (industrial chemicals, pesticides, etc.); toxins from bacteria and fungi in
the body; and vaccinations.
Diet appears to be a primary factor: heavy consumption of meat, sugar, refined grains, and rancid oils.
Overwork, emotional stress, fatigue, pregnancy, acute respiratory infections, chemical poisoning, and
poor diet are known to precede the onset.
MS usually begins between 25 and 40, and twice as often in women as men.
There is no known cure, but suggestions, below, will help retard (and possible halt) the progress of the
disorder."

very outset of the disorder, in order to arrest it. Vitamin E: intramuscularly at 80 mg per
day; orally, at 800-1,200 daily. Selenium: orally, intravenously, and, intramuscularly at 50-
1,000 mcg per day, based on weight.
• Essential fatty acids are needed (5 gm daily). Also choline or soy lecithin, at 10-20 gm
per day.
• Avoid food allergens and excessive fats; no more than 20% of daily calories should be in
fat.
• Avoid exercise for one month during initial treatment period, to avoid undue injury to
already weakened muscles.
—Also see ""Birth Defects.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Battles are to be fought every day. A great warfare is going on over every
soul, between the prince of darkness and the Prince of life. And you and I are in the middle of it. We
must stand true to God, and we do this by continually choosing to remain submissive to His will. No one
but your own choice can remove you from Christ's protection.

SYMPTOMS—Weakness of the muscles, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), enlargement of certain
muscle groups (calves, trapezius, etc.) to compensate for loss of major muscle groups. The muscles
gradually shrivel and weaken. The muscles in the trunk are especially affected. All muscles eventually
become involved.
CAUSES—Muscular dystrophy (MD) produces a weakening and wasting of muscle tissue which is not
noticed (because of replacement of muscle tissue with fat and fibrous scar tissue) until there is
substantial damage.
Animals given a vitamin E deficient diet develop muscular dystrophy. It is believed that MD could be
wiped out if vitamin E was given to all expectant mothers and bottle-fed babies. Mother's milk has six
times as much vitamin E as cow's milk, and almost twice as much selenium.
There may a hereditary factor, but diet is still the crucial issue."
disease-general-myasthenia-gravis,Myasthenia Gravis,"TREATMENT
• Clean out the colon, by means of colonics or high enemas. Go on a fruit/vegetable juice
fast for several days.
• Begin eating a nourishing diet, not overeating, and always including an abundant amount
of roughage (to aid in preventing constipation). Drink enough fluids.
• A deficiency in vitamin A can produce muscular and spinal cord degeneration. Also
important for the nerves and muscles are vitamins B (all), C, and E. Calcium, magnesium,
potassium, silicon, manganese, and zinc are also important for muscles and nerves.
• Lecithin is very important for good nerves, as well as chlorophyll.
• Good foods include buckwheat, millet, rye, and red potato peeling broth.
• Avoid the solanaceous crops, for they contain solanine, which interferes with the
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. These foods include tomatoes, white potatoes, green and
red peppers, egg plants, and tobacco.
• Avoid the glue foods, such as white flour and dairy products. Stay away from fried
foods, meat, all animal fats, cheese, and eggs.
• Do not overwork. Learn to relax; learn to work at a more moderate pace, and stop more
frequently to rest.
• Walk a little outdoors, and gradually build up. But do not overdo. A little walking is
good; too much of any exercise might not be.
• Helpful herbs include slippery elm, comfrey, oatstraw, and the nervine herbs: skullcap,
hop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, and small amounts of lobelia.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The world that Satan has claimed and has ruled over with cruel tyranny, the
son of God has, by one vast achievement, encircled in His love and connected again with the throne of
God. Thank your heavenly Father for what He offers you! And accept it now, right now.

SYMPTOMS—Muscular weakness, fatigue, emotional stress, and droopy eyelids. Difficulty in
breathing, swallowing, and speaking.
The onset is gradual, and the symptoms are worse in the evening. The person complains of difficulty in
chewing, swallowing, and talking.
CAUSES—Myasthenia gravis is a disease characterized by great muscular weakness (without atrophy)
and progressive fatigability. The name means ""muscle weakness.""
Adolescents and young adults, especially women, are the most likely to have this problem. But it
sometimes occurs in newborn infants and adults over 40. In the latter case, a tumor in the thymus is
involved. It rarely occurs past 50.
The muscles of the face and neck are primarily involved, but those in the trunk and extremities may also
be involved.
Some cases are mild; others are rapidly fatal. When the respiratory system is involved, death is much
more likely to result from this disease. Progress of the disorder is variable, and prolonged remission may
occur.
It is thought to be an autoimmune disease that causes malfunctioning of the enzyme, acetylcholine,
which is responsible for inducing muscles to contract. (It is conjectured that there may also be an excess
of cholinesterase at the myoneural junction in which the nerve impulses fail to induce normal muscle
contractions, but this is less likely.)
There is a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. Either the
acetylcholine release is not adequate or the muscle response to the acetylcholine is not sufficient. An
autoimmune factor may be involved (i.e., there are so many toxins in the body, that the system interferes
with normal functions.)
Autointoxication may thus be a primary cause. Toxins accumulate in the bloodstream from chemicals,
chronic constipation, etc. Either they destroy the muscular system or they trigger other body systems to
do so.
Chronic constipation can cause the cecum to press against the ileocecal valve, releasing poisons of the
colon back into the small intestine. This is a dangerous situation, since toxins in the small intestine are
absorbed into the blood far more quickly than when they are in the colon."
disease-general-parkinson-s-disease,Parkinson'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• It is very important that the person afflicted with Parkinson's disease keep active.
Muscles which are not used atrophy more quickly. The person's own determination and
faithfulness in an exercise program will forestall the progress of the disease better than
almost anything else. Every exercise keeps the muscles more useful. Use a wide variety of
simple exercises! Buy a book on weight lifting; but, of course, use much smaller weights.
Swing the arms forcefully when walking. Exercises involving joint movements (including
the neck) are very important.
• Keep the feet a distance apart, when walking, and take short steps, when turning.
• Typing, writing, working with clay, etc., helps the fingers.
• Breathe deeply in and out.
• Take frequent rest periods.
• Read aloud, to keep the mouth muscles in good condition.
• Any act difficult to perform should be done daily.
• A nutritious diet, adequate rest, exercise in the open air, enough fluids, and sunlight help
slow the effects of Parkinson's disease.
• Octocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.
• Eat foods and take supplements containing antioxidants. The most important of these is
vitamin E (3,200 IU daily!) and vitamin C (3,000 mg daily!). This can slow the
progression of Parkinson's disease by 2-3 years! Theoretically, a person who takes
significant dosage levels will never contract Parkinson's disease in the first place. It
appears that free-radical damage may be a major cause of damage of dopamine-producing
brain cells.
• Iron supplementation seems to help in some cases. The production of tyrosine, an
enzyme involved in dopa production (the precursor of dopamine), is stimulated by iron
supplementation in the diet.
• Here are some additional helps and dosages of worthwhile natural substances:
octocosanol (300 mcg, three times a day), Neuro-Gen leucine (10 gm/day), l-methionine
(5 gm/day), essential fatty acids (1tbsp., twice a day), ltyrosine (100 mg/day), dl-
phenoalanine (100 mg, three times a day), B (200 mg, three times a day), B (100 mg,
1 6
three times a day), betaine HCl (75-200 mg three times a day before meals).
• Overweight is a problem; take the extra weight off.
• Ingestion of aluminum is a factor in Alzheimer's disease, and it may also be involved in
Parkinson's disease. Do not use aluminum cookware or use deodorants containing it (alum
is aluminum). Also avoid lead. Some people with Parkinson's disease have high levels of
lead in their brains.
• L-dopa (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine), in form of the drug brand, Levodopa, is a synthetic
dopamine which is given to patients, to supply the missing dopamine. Intriguingly
enough, actual dopamine (from animal sources) cannot be given, because there is a blood-
brain barrier rejecting it. So levodopa is given, which is accepted (through conversion to
dopamine in the basal ganglion).
• But two facts should be noted: (1) Vitamin B reverses the effects of levodopa, so efforts
6
must be made to eliminate B from the diet. (Eat in moderation bananas, oatmeal, peanuts,
6
whole grains, potatoes, meat, and fish and only eat protein foods in the evening.) (2)
Levodopa usually produces side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, insomnia, mental
confusion, and agitation, as well as liver and kidney damage.
• L-dopa and carbidopa can aggravate and speed up the progress of Parkinson's disease in
many cases, and is said to have little beneficial effect in over half the cases.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Man's happiness must always be guarded by the law of God. That law is the
hedge which God has placed about His vineyard. By it those who obey are protected from evil. But only
through Christ's enabling merits can you be empowered to obey the Ten Commandments.

(Shaking Palsy, Paralysis agitans,
Parkinsonianism)
SYMPTOMS—Initially: mild to moderate tremor of the hand or hands while at rest, a feeling of being
slow and heavy, tendency to tire more easily, muscular stiffness, loss of skill in the fingers and thumb
(writing, buttoning and unbuttoning, playing the piano, etc.)
Later: depression, loss of appetite, muscular rigidity, permanent rigid stoop, shuffling gait, drooling,
tremors, fixed facial expression, and impaired speech. Ability to maintain balance may be affected.
The body gradually becomes rigid as limbs stiffen. Dementia may occur.
Principle signs are tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, and slow or retarded movement. Tremors and
slowness generally begin in one limb, then progress to the other limb on the same side; later still to the
other side. Usually the hands are affected before the feet.
CAUSES—Parkinson's disease is a gradual degeneration of the nervous system. The nerve cells in the
basal ganglion of the brain are gradually destroyed.
Parkinson's disease is one of the most common debilitating diseases in the United States. But actual
disability usually does not occur for 10-15 years after onset of symptoms.
Although the underlying cause is not known, symptoms appear when there is a lack of dopamine in the
brain. Dopamine is made by the body, and carries messages from one nerve cell to another. Normally,
another neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is made, to keep dopamine in balance. When there is not enough
acetylcholine, myasthenia gravis occurs; when there is not enough dopamine, the result is Parkinson's
disease.
In Parkinson's, the problem generally is destruction of the cells which make dopamine. But sometimes
the cause is blockage of the dopamine receptors in the brain.
One possible cause of this disorder is that too many toxins have been released in the body for the blood
to filter out through the liver. An excess of chemicals, drugs, toxins in meat eating, etc., are thought to
be involved. It is known that one of the chemicals in heroine directly destroys the key brain cells
preventing Parkinson's. A chronic poor diet, over many years, is also considered to be a significant
factor."
disease-general-polio,Polio,"TREATMENT
• In the late 1940s, Benjamin Sandler, M.D., was interviewed on the radio in the spring,
just before the summer polio season. He declared that, if sugar foods and especially Cokes
and soft drinks were avoided, polio would not be contracted. This went into the
newspapers and the East Coast area covered by the announcement had very little polio
that summer. Later, Sandler wrote a book detailing his concept.
Sugar injures the nerves; calcium is needed by the nerves; highly acid substances remove
calcium; phosphorous locks with calcium and carries it off, making it unavailable. Coca
Cola-type drinks combine all these special qualities! The liquid in Coke is more acid than
vinegar, yet is not noticed because of the very high sugar content. Coke is phosphoric
acid. So the sugar and acid eat away the calcium, and the phosphorus immediately locks
into it. A tooth, dropped in a glass of Coke, will melt away in a matter of hours.
• Another factor is being cold. People drink Cokes and other soft drinks at swimming
pools, then jump and in and vigorously swim in the cold water. So many people contract
polio at swimming pools in the summer that it is suspected that there must be something
in the pool water. But the problem is the soft drinks, not contaminated pool water.
• The body is adapted to the intense heat of mid-summer; but poor diet plus soft drinks
weaken it, then the cold plunge intensifies the effects.
• Because it was so dangerous to the health, Coca Cola was banned from interstate
commerce by the original Food and Drug Administration early in the 20th century. That is
why, to this day, Cokes and Pepsi's are made in local bottling plants. The syrup is shipped
interstate, and then, with water, is poured into bottles.
• Franklin D. Roosevelt was very athletic. He fought a forest fire near his home, ate some
junk food, and jumped in an ice-cold river to cool off. He then came down with polio.
• Another factor is keeping the body warm.
• As soon as a person comes down with polio, he is placed in bed and observed. —But,
what should be done is to place him immediately in a warm, full bathtub or, better, give
him the ""Kenny packs.""
• Nurse Kenny (called Sister Kenny, because nurses in Australia are called ""sister"")
applied hot packs to the patients (on parts, or all, of their bodies), and eliminated polio
with few or no after effects. But this water therapy method was not permitted in America.
It was too effective.
Other factors:
• During the infectious stage, keep the diet high in protein and potassium, to replace that
which is lost because of tissue destruction.
• Fluid, caloric, and sodium intake should also be increased because of the fever.
Additional B vitamins are also needed, along with vitamins A and C.
• Give antispasmodic tincture (which see). Give doses (according to age) of 8-15 drops in
1/4th glass of hot water.
• Helpful herbs include prickly ash berries, wild cherry bark, valerian root, skullcap,
goldenseal, black cohosh, red clover, catnip, and yellow dock.
• Dr. Salk, himself (developer of injectable polio vaccine), warned against the serious
dangers in taking oral polio vaccine! Beware of oral polio vaccine! In the latter part of the
20th century, oral polio vaccine has produced more cases of polio than any other agency.
• In addition, there is extreme danger in handling the bowel movement of an infant who
has received the oral polio vaccine! You can get crippling polio from doing so.
• Medical history reveals that people who were vegetarians, did not eat junk foods, or
drink soft drinks, but lived a clean life—and avoided polio vaccines; and those recently
receiving them—have rarely contracted polio.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The way of salvation has been opened to the fallen race on Planet Earth. That
salvation is offered to you, right now. It is yours to claim, as you accept Christ and let Him strengthen
you, to obey the precepts in the Bible.

(Poliomyelitis, Infantile Paralysis)
SYMPTOMS—Fever, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and irritability.
Incubation is generally 2-7 days, and onset is often abrupt. There may be digestive disturbance, plus a
slight elevation of temperature, usually for not more than 3 days. Then paralysis may, or may not,
develop.
Bend the person's neck forward. If it aches, polio may be coming on.
CAUSES—Poliomyelitis means ""gray marrow,"" and is inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal
cord. The condition is not confined to infancy, nor is paralysis always involved. Polio is a virus infection
of the spinal cord which destroys the nerves controlling muscular movement, often resulting in paralysis
of certain muscles.
The first of two stages of polio is the infectious stage, when the virus is active. The second is the
noninfectious stage, when recovery may occur.
Paralysis may be confined to a small part of the body or much, or nearly all, of it. But muscle atrophy
may also occur. Death usually only occurs in bulbar and respiratory cases. Aside from
bronchopneumonia, other complications are relatively few.
Epidemics, when they occur, usually reach their peak during the warmest months (July and August)."
disease-general-post-polio-syndrome,Post-Polio Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• A cleansing diet, followed by a rebuilding, nourishing diet. Avoid all the junk foods.
• Eat foods high in fiber and vitamin/mineral supplementation. Calcium, magnesium,
potassium, and silicon are important. Selenium and zinc, along with vitamins A, C, D, and
E are antioxidants. The B complex is important for strengthening the nerves.
• A regular exercise program.
—Also see ""Polio"" and ""Nerves Strengthening.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—There are many battles to be fought, but our part is to cling to Christ as little
children, pleading for His help. He will enable you to come off more than conqueror in the battles with
temptation and sin.

SYMPTOMS—Difficulty in swallowing, which could produce a risk of choking. A progressive muscle
weakness.
CAUSES—More than 125,000 Americans have post-polio syndrome."
disease-general-kuru,Kuru,"SYMPTOMS—Ataxia (balance problems) and decreased coordination progressing to paralysis,
dementia, slurring of speech, and visual disturbances.
CAUSE AND PREVENTION—Kuru is a slow, progressive, fatal viral infection of the central nervous
system. The incubation period may be 30 or more years, but death usually occurs within months of the
onset of symptoms.
There are only two classes of people who contract kuru: (1) cannibals, particularly in the central New
Guinea highlands and (2) those who submit to transplant surgery.
Research reveals that brain tissue from infected people produces the disease when inoculated into
primates in the laboratory.
So the solution is to not eat people, either through cannibalism or by having transplant surgery. (A
second problem to transplant surgery is that most persons must thereafter remain on immuno-
suppressants the rest of their life. Doing so renders them as vulnerable to disease as a person with
AIDS.)
ENCOURAGEMENT—We owe to Christ all that makes life desirable, and He asks of us the affections
of the heart and the obedience of the life. His precepts, if obeyed, will bring happiness into the home
life, happiness to every individual.

Nervous-Mental
Part 5
Memory Problems
# MEMORY IMPROVEMENT
IMPROVING YOUR MEMORY—Here are several suggestions to try to remember:
The attitude toward remembering is important. As we get older, it is easier to become lazy about trying
to learn.
Pay attention to what you want to remember. Sometimes we are too busy or indolent to really give our
attention to what we need to remember.
An outstanding way to remember something is to say it out aloud to yourself. When you do this, you
both speak it and hear it. If it is written down and you do this—you see it, speak it, and hear it.
An equally outstanding way to memorize something (or teach it to children) is to say it over several
times. Saying it, speaking it, hearing it, and repetition, are powerful ways to learn math tables and other
things.
Here are more suggestions:
Categorize the items you want to remember. List what you need to remember under their logical
categories, and you will be more likely to remember the main points and the subsidiary ones.
When you set your glasses down on a table where you do not usually place them, take a good look at
them and think about what you have done.
As you walk away from your car in a mall parking lot, say out loud, to yourself, aspects of the location,
so you can return to it.
When trying to remember someone's name, take a good look at their face as you think of, or speak, their
name.
When trying to remember numbers, put them into units or chunks. It is harder to remember 6-8-7-2-5-0-
9 than it is to recall 687-2509.
If you are trying to memorize a new word or how to spell it, learn the meaning of the word and make it
part of your everyday vocabulary. Or write it down several times.
Associate a new word or name with a similar word or an object.
Select the most important things to remember, and skip the rest.
Quiz yourself on what you are supposed to remember before you come to the time when you have to use
that knowledge.
Avoid stress. When you are under tension or in a time schedule, it is harder to remember things.
Of course, you can also jot down lists on paper. Some people quickly write notes on the palm of their
hand.
And, of course, make sure you are eating a good diet, skipping the junk food, getting fresh air, exercise
every day, and getting enough rest at night.
In addition, there are also nutrition and lifestyle factors which will affect your memory. See ""Nerves,
Strengthening.""
—Also see ""Memory Problems.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—How much should those rejoice who are the objects of such amazing love!
Christ loved you, or He would not have died to forgive your sins and enable you to obey His Father's
law. Accept the great salvation, and rejoice that your name is written in heaven."
disease-general-memory-problems,Memory Problems,"TREATMENT
• Eat a nourishing, balanced, diet and skip all the junk, processed, and fried food. Good
food is needed to nourish the brain.
• Nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B complex and amino acids, add to memory
loss. Obtain your proteins from brewer's yeast, brown rice, millet, nuts, soy, and whole
grains rather than from meat sources.
• Maintain an even amount of blood sugar. This is best done by eating complex
carbohydrates at mealtime, and no food between meals.
• Avoid greasy and high-cholesterol foods; both interfere with passage of food through the
blood to the brain.
• Avoid free radicals in the diet; these can greatly damage brain memory.
• Avoid refined sugars; these reduce brain power.
• For some people, dairy and wheat products cause memory reduction. Try cutting them
out for a month and see if there is improvement.
• Drink enough water, get enough rest at night. Exercise regularly.
• Stop using liquor, drugs, caffeine, and tobacco. Alcohol does an excellent job of
destroying the brain.
• Ginkgo biloba increases blood flow to the brain. Other helpful herbs include ginseng,
anise, and blue cohosh.
—Also see ""Memory, Improvement.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We owe to Christ all that we have. In requiring obedience to the laws of His
kingdom, God gives His people health, happiness, peace, and joy. The more fully we obey, through faith
in Christ, the happier we shall be.

(Forgetfulness)
SYMPTOMS—You find you are forgetting too many things.
CAUSES—People fear memory problems, because it might indicate the onset of Alzheimer's disease
(which see). Alzheimer's generally begins gradually in the mid-40s, and is fairly common among many
older people; so folk have reason to be concerned.
But two facts stand out: Some memory loss does not have to mean Alzheimer's; it is possible to keep the
mind in good shape, even into advanced age.
Alcoholism, aging, candidiasis, stress, allergies, thyroid problems, hypoglycemia, diabetes, and poor
circulation are factors in memory loss. Others are cited below."
disease-general-korsakoff-s-syndrome,Korsakoff'S Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Three times a day, take vitamin B (100 mg), lecithin (2,500 mg), chromium/vanadium
1
(50-200 mcg), selenium (200-1,000 mcg), and betaine HCl.
• Obtain adequate rest, exercise, water, and fresh air.
• Do pulse tests (which see), to determine allergies. Avoid sugar and alcohol.
• Memory loss can also be caused by senile dementia, Korsakoff's syndrome, Alzheimer's
disease, allergies (all of which see), or alcoholism.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ will be with you in the daily battle with self, that you may be true to
principle. The appetites and passions may be controlled as you rely on Him for help. Jesus has been over
the ground, and knows the temptations you must meet. He knows how to guide you through them.

(Recent Memory Loss; False Alzheimer's
Disease)
SYMPTOMS—Inability to keep new events or facts in the memory, although earlier data already in the
memory is still there.
CAUSES—This is a type of ""amnesia"" which can result from chronic alcoholism, a blow to the head, or
vitamin B deficiency.
1
Because of embarrassment, people with this problem tend to make up stories and invent ""facts,"" to
satisfy others.
A blow to the head generally brings recovery, but the problem is less likely to be reversed, if alcoholism
or B deficiency is the cause.
1"
disease-general-alzheimer-s-disease,Alzheimer'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• The above data is full of suggestions for treatment and prevention.
• If a person is developing Alzheimer's, he should be told, so he can prepare for the future
and settle his affairs.
ENCOURAGEMENT—How can we be in doubt and uncertainty, and feel that we are orphans? God
gave all heaven in Christ, and as we come and claim the great Gift, heaven begins here. Rejoice,
Rejoice. If you will cling to Christ, your future is very bright.

SYMPTOMS—Disoriented perceptions of space and time, inability to concentrate or communicate, and
memory loss.
This produces depression, agitation, withdrawal, insomnia, irritability, memory loss, personality
changes, severe mood swings, and senility.
An intriguing early warning sign has been discovered at the San Diego Medical Center: As much as 2
years before mental decline, those with Alzheimer's begin to lose their sense of smell. The rate at which
the ability to distinguish strong odors diminishes is an indicator of how rapidly an individual will lose
mental functioning. (But smokers have already lost part of this sense, so the diagnostic test does not
work as well when applied to them.)
CAUSES—Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration. Memory and thought processes
are weakened and disoriented.
Nerve fibers, leading into, and out of, the hippocampus in the brain become tangled and short circuited.
As a result, information is no longer carried to, and from, the brain. New memories cannot be gained,
and old memories cannot be retrieved.
In addition, plaques of a certain protein (beta-amyloid) build up in the brain, damaging nerve cells.
One form of Alzheimer's occurs between 36 and 45, and is quite rapid. The more gradual form develops
in those who are 65 or 70.
Simple forgetfulness is not Alzheimer's. If you do not remember your wife's name, that is forgetfulness;
if you forget you have a wife, that is dementia (of which Alzheimer's is a form).
There are other disorders which produce similar symptoms: Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries),
which slowly reduces blood flow to the brain; a series of minor strokes; hypothyroidism; advanced
syphilis.
Many elderly people are taking 8 or 10 medicinal drugs. This drugging will surely affect the brain. You
can see the effects in nursing homes across the continent. Add to this a devitalized diet of fried,
processed, and junk food.
Other causes include heavy metals in the body. One in particular stands out: When you hear the words,
""Alzheimer's disease,"" think of it as ""aluminum disease,"" for this is what it often is.
Autopsies on persons who died with Alzheimer's reveal accumulations of up to 4 times the normal
amount of aluminum in the nerve cells of the brain. Significantly, especially high concentrations are in,
and around, the hippocampus.
(See ""Aluminum Poisoning"" for much more information.)
But those with Alzheimer's also have high levels of mercury in their brain. Beware of amalgam dental
fillings. Mercury from the fillings gradually passes into the body and, over a period of time, accumulates
in the brain.
Obtaining an adequate supply of minerals in the diet helps keep heavy metals from accumulating in the
body.
Women with Alzheimer's have lower estrogen levels than normal.
Free radicals are another factor. Avoid foods which contain them.
Those with Alzheimer's have low levels of vitamin B and zinc in their bodies. All the B complex
12
vitamins are important.
Vitamins A and E, important antioxidant vitamins, are also important.
Levels of choline and ethanolamine are lower in those with Alzheimer's.
Undergo a trial of intensive nutritional therapy, especially B injections. This may ward off the
12
developing problem.
Those with Alzheimer's tend to have a strong craving for sweets. But such a craving is frequently an
indication of a food hunger for vitamins and minerals.
Some people with Down's syndrome (which see) live to be in their 30s or 40s; they usually develop
Alzheimer's."
disease-general-senility,Senility,"TREATMENT
• Reduce vitamin D intake to a maximum of 400 units a day, for it works with cholesterol
to cause blood vessel problems. Vitamin D is angiotoxic; that is, toxic to blood vessels.
• Choline and lecithin are both important. Also take vitamin C to bowel tolerance, as well
as vitamin E. The B complex vitamins are important for the nervous system and brain.
• A New England hospital successfully treated senility by giving niacin and a high-
potency vitamin supplement. This opened up the narrowed blood vessels. Niacin has a
vasodilatory effect on the body. That is why, when taken, it temporarily causes the face to
flush.
• Stop using alcohol, tobacco, and nicotine.
• Eat lightly of nutritious food. Mainly eat raw or slowly cooked foods. Raw seeds and
nuts help the brain, but eat in moderation. Millet and buckwheat are good.
• Ginkgo, an herb, may help prevent further deterioration of mental capacities.
• Daily exercising, to the point of breathlessness, is vital to good circulation. But do not
overdo! Only go up to the point of breathlessness, not beyond. Too much can lead to a
heart attack.
• Heavy metals must be avoided. Never use aluminum cookware, or other aluminum
products. Do not use canned goods any more than necessary.
—Also see ""Organic Brain Syndrome"" and ""Aging.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The spirit of unselfish labor for others gives depth, stability, and Christ-like
loveliness to the character and brings peace and happiness to it possessor. Every duty performed, every
sacrifice made in the name of Jesus, brings an exceeding great reward.

(Senile Dementia; Cerebrovascular Disease)
SYMPTOMS—Memory loss in the older years, an inability to reason properly which interferes with the
home, employment, depression.
CAUSES—Also called Dementia, this occurs in old age, yet is not widespread. Most older people do
not have this problem. Many people in advanced age are quite clear in their thought processes.
(But there are actually two types of dementia: Primary dementia comes on gradually, without apparent
cause. Secondary dementia comes on suddenly from brain injury, operation, drugs, or diabetic coma; is
usually reversible. Senility and Alzheimer's are examples of primary dementia.)
Common causes of senility include poor blood circulation to, and in, the brain, cerebral arteriosclerosis,
heavy metal toxicity, prolonged nutritional deficiency, prolonged use of medicinal drugs, and lack of
exercise and fresh air.
Calcification and fatty cholesterol deposits in the middle cerebral artery reduces the main blood supply
to the brain, resulting in a poor oxygen supply to the brain. This produces a loss of memory and typical
""senile"" changes.
The experts tell us that, over a matter of years, wearing uncomfortable collars and neckties tend to cause
eddies in the carotid arteries, contributing to the deposition of cholesterol.
Many of those diagnosed as senile are actually suffering from the effects of medicinal drugs. Avoid
drugs throughout your life, if you want a happy old age. But hearing, thyroid, liver, or kidney problems
can also produce apparent memory loss. There is the possibility of brain tumors, as well as stroke, and
various problems with the nervous system.
A combination of nutritional deficiencies is often the underlying cause."
disease-general-organic-brain-disorder,Organic Brain Disorder,"TREATMENT
• Eat a nutritious, balanced, diet.
• Niacin, B , B , and folic acid are needed; also chromium and zinc. Essential fatty acids
1 12
are also needed. Vitamin E repairs brain damage. Manganese improves memory. The
brain also needs calcium and magnesium. Lecithin helps clean plaques from the arteries.
• Include enough fiber in the diet. A congested colon weakens the blood supply to the
brain.
• Avoid overcooking and too much cooked foods.
• Avoid alcohol, lead poisoning, mercury poisoning (found in dental amalgam).
• Do a pulse test, to determine if food allergens are part of the problem.
• Do a six-hour glucose tolerance test, to see if diabetes or hypoglycemia is involved.
• Hydrochloric acid (Betaine HCl) supplementation may be needed to increase food
absorption.
• Herbs which help include capsicum, burdock, echinacea, garlic, ginkgo, psyllium, and
gotu kola.
ENCOURAGEMENT—He who has given His precious life because He loved you, and wanted you to
be happy, will be a Captain who will always be mindful of your interests. As, by faith in Christ, you
obey Him, in the very act of fulfilling your duties God will bring you a blessing.

Part 6
Emotional, Mental

(Chronic Brain Syndrome)
SYMPTOMS—Errors in judgment, lack of reasoning ability, short-term memory loss, disorientation,
poor intellectual function, neglect of personal hygiene.
Severe symptoms include hallucinations, incoherent speech, agitation, and restlessness.
CAUSES—Malnutrition can induce the symptoms of organic brain syndrome. Chemicals and other
toxins can influence it also, as well as food allergens."
disease-general-hyperactivity,Hyperactivity,"TREATMENT
• Change whatever items, cited above, you are able.
• Provide the child with a nourishing diet, as discussed elsewhere in this book. This is
important.
• Locate and eliminate food allergies. See ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test.""
• Avoid all foods containing salicylates.
• Foods that irritate the stomach or inflame the nerves must be removed from the child's
diet. Avoid all refined sugar, fried, and junk foods from the diet. This includes soft drinks.
Eliminate artificial flavorings, colorings, and preservatives. Do not attempt to only change
the diet partway. Nourishing food, and only nourishing food, must become a way of life. It
will help all in the home. It will be easier for the child to accept the new regime if the
mother (and hopefully, father) does also.
• The parent must learn to control the situation, by training the child to obedience and self-
control. This is vital. Teaching the child to obey you causes him to learn to control
himself. This enables him to organize, and better manage, his mental discipline and his
entire life.
• Regularity in rising, eating, bedtime, and other daily schedules is important.
—Also see ""Dyslexia.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—A strong, helpful grasp of the hand of a true friend is worth more than gold or
silver. Christ has been such a friend to you. He asks that you be such a friend to others.

(Hyperkinesis)
SYMPTOMS—Cannot sit still, short attention span, impulsive acts before one thinks, runs rather than
walks, forgets easily, moody, temper tantrums, irritated and indifferent when disciplined, determined to
get his own way.
Sleep disturbances, clumsiness, head-knocking, bothers other children, speech and hearing disorders,
extreme distractibility, absent-mindedness, unable to follow a series of instructions.
Not all symptoms are found in any one child. The symptoms are not limited to children, but are also
found in some adults.
Keep in mind that most children display some hyperactive symptoms at times.
CAUSES—Hyperactivity is now called ""attention deficit disorder"" or, sometimes, ""attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder"" (ADHD). Primarily occurring in children, it produces a variety of learning and
behavior problems.
Some of the causes include:
Allergies to milk, wheat, chocolate, yeast, food additives, oranges, and antibiotics.
Lead poisoning can be a significant factor.
Eating too much sugar or sugar foods, smoking during pregnancy, oxygen deprivation at birth, prenatal
trauma.
Artificial food additives, preservatives and foods containing salicylates, other food additives.
Low-protein diet.
Emotional problems and inadequate, inconsistent, or ineffective discipline in the home. Hyperactive
children often control the situation in the home more than the parents. Because parents are too yielding,
children find they can scream their way to dominance, and become uncontrollable.
When spoiled children enter school, they sometimes try to use overactivity to control their new
environment.
Hyperactive children often have learning disabilities.
Certain types of fluorescent lights are overstimulating.
Overstimulation from television, competitive games, violent TV programs and, nutritional deficiencies
are major factors.
Mothers who smoke are more likely to give birth to brain-damaged or hyperactive children.
Children from broken homes are more likely to have this problem.
A strong link has been established between learning disabilities and juvenile crime. Try to solve the
problems early."
disease-general-dyslexia,Dyslexia,"TREATMENT
• Food allergies should be located and eliminated. Food sensitivities can produce learning
disabilities, which may appear to have organic origin.
• Beware of sugar, wheat, milk products, possibly certain other grains, and meat. In one or
more (often several) of these may lie the problem.
• Carry out pulse tests (which see), to determine possible causes, and eliminate offending
foods.
• Taking hydrochloric acid (betaine HCl) and digestive enzymes may be necessary for a
time.
ENCOURAGEMENT—In all His dealings with His creatures, God has maintained the principles of
righteousness by revealing sin in its true character. It is obvious that the wages of sin is misery and
death. The unconditional pardon of sin never has been and never will be. God saves us from sin, not in
sin.

(a disturbance in the ability to read)
SYMPTOMS—A physical problem. The child's eyes actually see the letters backward, as compared to
the normal child's eyes.
CAUSES—Dyslexia is sometimes called hyperactivity (which see), but there is a partial difference.
Dyslexia is a complex syndrome rather than a specific disease.
In some instances, a true organic or biochemical brain injury has occurred. But most of the time, the
problem is more easily treatable.
Food allergies are often a key problem."
disease-general-nightmares,Nightmares,"TREATMENT
• Do not eat 4 hours before bedtime.
• Eat a light supper of fruit and toast. Too much food in the stomach is a major cause of
nightmares.
• Food allergies are another prime cause. Search them out and eliminate them (see
""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test).""
• Hypoglycemia is another significant cause. The low point of low blood sugar level
occurs at 4 to 4½ hours after food is eaten, especially sugar foods and drinks (cookies and
milk, etc.).
• Include chromium in the diet.
• Avoid caffeine.
• Liquor drinking and hard drugs induce nightmares.
• Sometimes the problem is emotional; a parent that is mean to the child, a terrifying
incident that a person has had, etc. Go to God with these problems; only He can bring
peace of heart.
• Before bedtime, go outdoors and walk in the cool night air, breathe deep, and relax.
• Some take a whole, warm, bath before bedtime, to relax.
• Avoid enervation of any kind. Do not overwork.
ENCOURAGEMENT—It would fill the unfallen worlds with consternation if God were to take men
who love and revel in sin—to heaven. Thank God, there is power in the blood, to cleanse from sin and
defilement. There is strength in the atonement, to enable man to fulfill the will of God in his life.
PHOBIAS and PANIC ATTACKS
(Irrational Fears; Anxiety Disorder;
Agoraphobia; Claustrophobia, etc.)
SYMPTOMS—An irrational fear of something, which ordinary people are not bothered by. The experts
call it an irrational, involuntary, inappropriate fear reaction that generally leads to an avoidance of
common everyday places, objects, or situations.
Symptoms include attacks of tension, panic, dizziness, tightening of the throat, inability to swallow,
muscle twitching, sweating, depression, nausea, and obsessions. Feeling of being outside the body.
The heart starts beating faster; the person feels nauseous, shaky, as if about to faint.
CAUSES—There are three types of phobias: simple phobias, social phobias, and agoraphobia.
Those with simple phobias dread a certain situation, place, or object.
Social phobics are those who do not like to be in public situations, such as a party. They fear doing
something which may embarrass themselves.
Agoraphobics fear being alone, being in public places, or being in strange places. It is a fear of being
away from a safe person or place. This is the phobia that people most frequently talk to professional
counselors about. Most agoraphobics are women, who develop it between 15 and 35.
Panic attacks are closely related to phobias and strongly held anxieties.
The body has a natural fight-or-flight mechanism, when more adrenaline is produced, causing the body
to increase metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, so the body will have more immediate
energy. Muscles become tense, and heartbeat and breathing become more rapid.
But when this mechanism occurs, without a reasonable reason, the result is a panic attack.
The problem often develops suddenly after a major problem, such as a severe illness, accident, or mental
depression.
The attack may occur suddenly, perhaps while standing in line at the checkout counter. The worst thing
such people can do is to go home and stay there, in order to avoid facing the problematic situation. This
prevents the formation of coping skills and only worsens the problem.
Some can only go outdoors if they have a certain friend or trusted dog with them. Some can move freely
about in a feared area if it is dark. Wearing sunglasses when they go out in the daytime may ease the
problem while they are overcoming it.
Hot weather, fatigue, or illness often makes the symptoms worse.
Post-menstrual syndrome is another cause.
• Phobics often eat lots of sweets. Cut them out of the diet.
• White flour should also be eliminated. Only eat whole grains.
• Avoid caffeine in every form (including chocolate) if you have panic attacks. Do not
drink alcohol. Medicinal drugs can be a cause.
• Rebound anxiety and panic attacks can occur when Valium, Xanix, or Prozac is taken, to
ward them off. Xanix can be addictive!
• Food allergies can be the cause (cow's milk, corn, etc.). Keep a food diary and gradually,
over a period of time, determine what foods are bothering you. Do pulse tests (which see).
• Panic attacks and calcium deficiencies go hand in hand. Calcium protects the nerves and
prevents toxins from irritating them.
• Valuable minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium are depleted by stress.
The B vitamins are also important in resisting stress.
• Selenium elevates mood and decreases anxiety.
• Take chromium (200-300 mcg/day), B (100 mg/3 times day), B (450 mg/3 times day),
6 3
B , B , B (50 mg/3 times day), tryptophane (10 gr/3 times day), calcium (2000 mg/day),
1 2 5
and magnesium (800 mg/day).
• Eat a rounded balance of amino acids; but, of course, do not consume too much protein.
• Chemical fumes, such as formaldehyde from newly purchased clothes or carpets, can
induce panic attack feelings.
• A severe hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) reaction. Professionals call this a ""crash and
burn"" curve because the down slope on the glucose curve is almost vertical. Diabetes can
be involved here. (See ""Hypoglycemia"" and ""Diabetes."")
• Do a six-hour glucose tolerance test.
• Get regular exercise out-of-doors. Adequate rest is important.
• When you have a problem, have a friend you can talk it over with.
• Avoiding your fear keeps you from overcoming it. Face your fear and, slowly, reason
with yourself that it is nothing to be worried about. One individual feared allowing a small
bird on, or near, her. She overcame it by slowly placing her finger near a tame canary in a
cage, which hopped on and sat quietly. After doing this for several days, the fear was
overcome.
• Think to yourself, ""That person (object, place) cannot hurt me."" It is the truth, and keep
telling it to yourself. Shift from negative thoughts toward it, to positive thoughts.
• Recognize the attack for what it is. You have had them before, so you know you are not
going to die. You have left the house before, and you know you can do it again. You can
do it.
• Be easy on yourself, but keep pushing forward. Even if an attack comes on, tell yourself
how you succeeded, and keep at it. Do not give up.
• Start out slowly, but expose yourself to the unpleasant environment a little every week.
Set goals for yourself: one-week goals, 8-week goals, etc. Push forward and accomplish
them.
• You will notice that sometimes the fear is stronger than at other times. Determine what
causes it to increase: a dietary problem, not enough rest, etc.
• When an attack comes on, you have an excess of adrenaline. So do not sit still. Instead
move about and do something; this will help use it up. Walk around or exercise during the
attack. If the situation is such that you cannot move about (you are standing in line, etc.),
then play a game at alternatively tightening and loosening various muscles in your body.
Tighten the large muscles in your upper legs, then release them.
• It is now known that people with inner ear problems (where the sense of balance is
located) tend to have phobias and panic attacks.
• When an attack seems to be coming on, breathe deeply. Take repeated deep breaths. This
relaxes the mind and helps the whole system brace against the intruding fear. (When an
attack begins, phobics tend to take short, rapid breaths. The body is not receiving enough
oxygen and is losing too much carbon dioxide, the heart begins beating faster, and there is
a sense of air hunger.) Instead, breathe slowly and deeply.
• Women who wear tight-fitting clothes tend to become chest breathers, and are more
likely to have panic attacks. Men should wear suspenders.
• Maintain good posture. Practice deep breathing every so often.
• When an attack begins to occur, or if even the thought of the feared item begins to come
to mind, tell yourself ""stop!"" If necessary, say ""Stop!"" out loud. Then consciously change
your thoughts to something else, something pleasant. Keep doing this. By doing thought-
stopping, you will see excellent progress in as little as 4 weeks.
• When you are completely relaxed and in a pleasant environment, think casually about
the feared item. Candidly tell yourself that it does not amount to anything. Then change
the thought to something else.
• ""Flooding"" occurs when the person goes into the feared situation (such as a shopping
mall) and stays there until the fears leave. This generally takes 8 to 12 hours.
• Reinforcement takes place when you write the shopping list until it no longer bothers
you. Then you put on your coat and go to the door. Then you go outside to the car. Then,
when this no longer bothers you; you go to the store and walk up to the door. Later, you
go on in and buy the groceries.
• Pray to God for help. He can give you the strength you need to meet your needs.
Thousands have come to Him and obtained the help needed to win great victories in their
lives. It is a sweet experience to have peace with God.
• Herbs to help strengthen the body include dong quai, gotu kola, kelp, ginkgo, passion
flower, slippery elm, suma, valerian, and lady's slipper.
—Also see ""Hyperventilation"" and ""Nerves, Strengthening.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—God is the lifegiver. From the beginning, all His laws were ordained to life.
But sin broke in upon the order that God had established, and discord followed. It is only because the
Redeemer died on our behalf, that we can be enabled to return obedience to the King of the universe.

SYMPTOMS—Unpleasant dreams while sleeping.
CAUSES—In most cases, nightmares can be solved."
disease-general-hyperventilation,Hyperventilation,"TREATMENT
• When this happens, people often go to the emergency room of the hospital. And what do
they do? They may hand the sufferer a paper sack and ask him to breathe into it for a short
time. This replenishes the carbon dioxide in the body, and brings him back to normal.
• But there is a danger here: The person might be having, not a hyperventilation problem,
but a real heart attack (which see). In this article, we will assume that heart trouble is not
the problem. But you may want to check our various sections under Cardiovascular:
Heart.
• People who know they might experience hyperventilation attacks, from time to time,
sometimes carry a paper sack with them.
• Exercise also helps. It not only reduces anxiety, but exercise requires more oxygen—so
faster breathing is just fine.
• Do not smoke. This only adds to the problem, for nicotine is a stimulant and can aid in
triggering attacks. Caffeine is another stimulant to avoid.
• Practice calm, relaxed breathing. The average you should strive for is one moderate
breath every 6 seconds or 10 every minute. Ordinary people need never concern
themselves with how often they breath; but, if you have this special problem, you may
want to practice doing it the right way every so often.
• The more tense you are, the faster you will breath; so be calm, and think about breathing
slower.
• Think about someone else beside yourself. We can focus on our fears so much, they
come out of proportion.
• Avoid situations which tend to make you overly nervous. For example, for some people
this occurs when they are required to stand in crowds.
—Also see ""Phobias and Panic Attacks.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ says, ""Ye are the salt of the earth . . but the salt can lose its saltness.""
How careful we must be that we live like Jesus, so we do not become worthless salt.

SYMPTOMS—Pounding heart, fingers are tingling, and palms are sweaty.
CAUSES—Hyperventilation is overbreathing. It can be induced by stress. When some people are
frightened, they start breathing very fast—both rapidly and deeply, even though they do not need the
extra oxygen. This causes them to exhale a lot of carbon dioxide, which in turn causes the blood to
become somewhat alkaline. That results in the symptoms of a panic attack (which see).
Episodes of hyperventilation can last for hours, but generally for only 20-30 minutes. But, for the one
going through it, the experience can be quite difficult."
disease-general-depression,Depression,"TREATMENT
• Avoid processed and junk foods; they are a great source of emotional depression.
• Eating complex carbohydrates increases the amount of the amino acid, tryptophane, that
is ingested. This, in turn, increases the amount of serotonin made by the brain, which
calms and relaxes the whole system. (In contrast, high-protein foods promote the
production of dopamine and norepinephrine, which increases alertness.)
• Practice deep breathing outdoors, twice a day. This reduces a sense of gloom.
• Eat your meals on a regular schedule, and only eat nourishing food.
• Low blood sugar induces depression. Yet eating a high-sugar diet also produces
depression. Learn to eat right, of nourishing fruits, vegetables, and grains; avoid sugar
foods.
• Caffeine and tobacco both are known to induce depression.
• Go to bed on time at night, and maintain regularity in your daily schedule.
• Maintain a regular exercise program in order to increase feelings of well-being and
cheerfulness. Purposeful outdoor exercise, such as gardening, is ideal.
• Sunlight is beneficial for depression, since it suppresses melatonin production.
• Keep your weight down; and, if you are overweight, go on a gradual weight reduction
program.
• Food allergies are very significant. Locate and eliminate them. (See ""Allergies"" and
""Pulse Test."")
• Over 200 different medicinal drugs are reported to cause depression! You might consider
throwing out your medicine chest.
• Beware of antidepressant drugs! They lead to a wide variety of physical damage!
• Do something active. Forget yourself and find happiness in purposive activity. Do
something worthwhile that helps others: It may be washing the dishes; it may be going out
and helping a sick person.
• Talk it out; you may find that many of your problems really do not amount to much.
• Have a good cry. Crying releases tension and worry.
• Be respectful and kind to others. Making others miserable will only add to your own
misery. Being kind to others helps you feel better yourself.
• Beware of eating or shopping binges, to help you feel better. Neither accomplish the
intended purpose.
—Also see ""Manic Depression"" and ""Nerves, Strengthening.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you would have broad views, noble thoughts and aspirations, choose
associations that will strengthen right principles. Let every thought and the purpose of every action bend
to the securing of the future life, with the eternal happiness it will bring you.

SYMPTOMS—Decreased energy and appetite, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, headaches,
backaches, weight loss, slowed movement, purposeless thinking, irritability, quickness to temper, and
feeling like doing nothing.
CAUSES—Depression may be caused by the loss of a loved one or a job, food allergies, hypoglycemia,
environmental problems, or post-menstrual syndrome. Anything that disrupts a person's sense of worth,
stability, security, or effectiveness.
Forty percent of those with this problem have one or both of their parents who suffered it also.
Depression during the dark, dreary winter months is called seasonal affective disorder (which see).
Individuals with severe viral illness, hepatitis, endocrine problems, or stroke can have it.
An alternate type is bipolar depression (manic depression), in which a person varies between episodes of
depression and mania (over-excitedness). (See ""Manic Depression."").
Depression is twice as common in women as in men."
disease-general-manic-depression,Manic Depression,"TREATMENT
• A good nourishing diet is very important, omitting all junk food.
• Avoid processed, sugar, and fried foods.
• Locate allergy foods and eliminate them. (See ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test."")
• Food allergies, environmental sensitivities, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia (both of
which see) are major causes. Take a 6-hour glucose tolerance test. During the test,
someone must stay with the person and record his emotions and events (is he on an up,
down, or both).
• Foods which are common offenders include cow's milk, corn, wheat, rye, soy, and sugar.
• But also consider house dust, perfume, formaldehyde, and cosmetics as allergenic factors
to be avoided.
• Solving the manic depressive problem can require some weeks of careful diet and
elimination of offending factors.
• High doses of the B-complex vitamins are important. They normalize and strengthen
nerve function. The minerals found in nourishing food are also needed.
• Chromium and vanadium (500 mcg, 4 times a day), essential fatty acids (5 gm, 3 times a
day), niacin (450 mg, 4 times a day), B , B , B (each at 5 gm, twice a day).
1 5 6
• Avoid the amino acids, ornithine and arginine. Some say these and choline may make
symptoms worse. Others say that choline is needed. Still others say that choline should
only be taken in normal amounts with other B vitamin supplements. Researchers at MIT
found that choline helped reduce manic depression. So do as you think best regarding
choline.
• Obtaining sufficient balanced amino acids, especially tyrosine and taurine, are important.
—Also see ""Mania,"" ""Depression"" and ""Nerves, Strengthening.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We must accept Christ as our personal Saviour; and, as we do, He imputes to
us the righteousness of God. He enables us to obey the Bible. ""Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.""

(Bipolar Disorder; Mania)
SYMPTOMS—Extreme pessimism, withdrawal from society, changes in sleep patterns. A sudden loss
of interest in, and failure to, complete projects started with enthusiasm. There is chronic irritability,
sudden attacks of rage when crossed, and loss of inhibition. More symptoms given below.
CAUSES—Mania is a mental state characterized by excessive excitement. Depression is a mental state
characterized by dejection, lack of hope, and absence of cheerfulness.
Both of these qualities are strikingly observed in manic depression. Manic depression is cyclic, or
circular affective psychosis, in which there are alternating moods of depression and mania. Ordinarily
there is a series of periods of psychotic depression or excessive well-being, appearing in any sequence
and alternating with longer periods of relative normalcy.
Though intensity may vary greatly, the manic shows an elevated though unstable mood, a flight of ideas,
and great physical activity. The case of primary depression finds one thinking that all exertion is
exhausting. There is difficulty in thinking or acting and the person is very unhappy.
Manic-depressive disorder is also called bipolar disorder. It typically begins as depression and then
develops into alternating periods of depression and mania.
Both mania and depression can vary in intensity and length of the cycles (a few days to many months).
During the depression phase, some do nothing while others go through the motions of everyday work
while always feeling depressed.
Hypomania is a burst of energy and activity, but full-blown manic psychosis includes delusions of
grandeur, invincibility, or persecution, and may result in day and night activity without sleep.
Factors inducing manic depression include an overgrowth of yeast in the intestinal tract, food allergies,
environmental sensitivities, and certain diseases: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes,
Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease."
disease-general-mania,Mania,"TREATMENT
• Place the person on a nourishing diet, avoiding all junk food.
• Test for allergies (see ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test"").
• Give a 6-hour glucose tolerance test.
• Keep a daily diary, to test for PMS. Look in a Physician's Desk Reference, to locate
drugs which might be causing problems.
• Take the vitamins and minerals needed, to build strong nerves (see ""Nerves,
Strengthening"").
• Place the person in a quiet place, devoid of spectators. Give cold applications to the
head, face, and neck. Quiet, firm suggestions are important.
—Also see ""Hysteria—2"" and ""Melancholia—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is because of the love of God that the treasures of the grace of Christ have
been offered to men. What love is this, what unfathomable love, that Christ would die for us while we
were still sinners! Look at the cross of Calvary. It is a standing pledge of the boundless love, the
measureless mercy of the heavenly Father.

HYSTERIA—1
(Melancholia)
SYMPTOMS—There are a great variety of possible symptoms: The mental attitude is calm and
somewhat aloof. There may be easy laughing and crying; episodes of emotionalism, possibly without
any apparent explanation, and even occurring in sleep. The problem may, or may not, be psychotic in
nature.
In some cases, fugues occur. These are episodes when the person takes on a different personality, name,
etc., leaves and goes somewhere else for a time. When the primary personality returns, there is a
forgetting of the secondary state. But this problem is not the same as the psychotic condition, known as
schizophrenia—in which there is a splitting in personality, incongruities, and confusion co-exist in a
person at the same time.
CAUSES—There may be an emotional instability, various sensory disturbances, and a marked craving
for sympathy which sometimes leads to unusual words, actions, and activities.
Hysteria (melancholia) can result from post-menstrual syndrome, food allergies, hypoglycemia,
prescribed or illegal drugs, or alcoholism."
disease-general-mental-illness,Mental Illness,"TREATMENT
• There may be heredity factors, but the environmental factors and lifestyle are very
important! Nutritional deficiencies have a strong effect on mental health.
• Autointoxication and constipation are contributing factors in mental illness. Symptoms
which are alleviated range from mental sluggishness to hallucinations. Even schizophrenia
(which see) can be greatly lessened.
• There is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is
clogged, mental illness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in
others.
• Eliminate the ""glue foods""; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous
and toxins in it, and lead to mental problems. Such foods include white flour, sugar, eggs,
meat, peanuts, and dairy products.
• Brain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients (see ""Nerves,
Strengthening"").
• It is known that many cases of mental illness are solved when a simple, nourishing, diet,
including sufficient fiber and adequate vitamins and minerals, are given and the colon is
cleaned out with enemas or colonics.
• A high-carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the
brain, and produces a calming, peaceful, feeling.
• Exercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps
rejuvenate the body and mind.
• Allergy specialists successfully treat individuals with mental illness by isolating foods
and chemicals in the environment which induce the mental problems. Allergic reactions
may be a factor in criminal behavior. In some cases, the offending food does not cause
mental reactions until hours after being eaten. This is called ""masked food allergy."" Do
not under-rate the allergy factor! (See ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test."")
• Many persons with schizophrenia, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning
disorders are caused by too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes.
Plastic water pipes are the safest.
• Herbs which calm the brain and nerves include hops, chamomile, skullcap, valerian,
wood betony, and schizandra.

ENCOURAGEMENT—There is a God in Israel, who can bring deliverance to all that are oppressed.
He will draw near to you, right where you are, and minister to your needs. All you need to do is ask
Him—just now.

SYMPTOMS—Depression, anxiety, delusions, nervousness, loss of interest in school or work, sleep
pattern changes, irritability, withdrawal from society, sudden rages, lack of enthusiasm, and panic
attacks.
CAUSES—It is important that we note that this article includes both neurotic and psychotic syndromes.
Just because a person has one or more of the symptoms noted here, that does not mean he is crazy. He
may just be having a hard time dealing with life.
The experts divide mental illness into two main varieties: mood disorders and schizophrenia (which see).
Elsewhere we discuss a variety of episodic mood disorders (Depression, Manic Depression, Phobias,
and Hysteria). Those with episodic problems generally return to normal between spells.
In this article, we shall overview a few primary factors in all mental illness. An important related article
is ""Nerves, Strengthening.""
A person is no longer able to cope effectively with emotional or physical stresses, which others are able
to handle. Women are twice as likely to experience mental illness."

are those of Melancholia, and the treatment must be modified accordingly."
disease-general-schizophrenia,Schizophrenia,"TREATMENT
• Using orthodox psychiatric treatment, complete recovery is rare. The orthodox methods
use various tranquilizers, all with severe side effects—electroconvulsive shock therapy
and psychotherapy. Orthodox remedial substances deplete many essential vitamins, are
highly toxic, damage brain tissue, and should be avoided.
• Using natural remedies, which are far broader in scope, solutions are much more likely.
• The primary areas of treatment are discussed above.
• Go on a fruit and vegetable juice diet for a time. This will provide vitamins and minerals
while keeping the blood sugar normal during the fast. Repeat short juice fasts or one
longer one for 4-6 weeks. Overly sweet fruit juices should be avoided or diluted 50-50
with water.
• During this time, give massive doses of niacin, in the form of niacinamide (1,000-3,000
mg with each meal; often as much as 25,000-30,000 mg per day). An equal amount of
vitamin C should be given, B vitamins, especially pantothenic acid, and 3-5 tbsp. of
brewer's yeast.
• After recovery, a large daily dose of niacinamide will have to be continued indefinitely.
• Repeat: Do not give massive doses of niacin, but rather in the form of niacinamide.
• Avoid all processed, junk, and fried foods. Do not use white flour or sugar foods. Stop
eating meat. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.
• Eat a high-fiber diet, including plenty of fresh raw vegetables and quality protein.
Complex carbohydrates in the diet are important to keep the blood sugar level.
—Also see ""Mental Illness"" and ""Nerves, Strengthening"" for much additional information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Serving Christ will place upon you no restriction that will not increase your
happiness. In complying with His requirements, you will find a peace, contentment, and enjoyment that
you can never have in the path of sin.

(Paranoic, Catatonic, Hebephrenic; Dementia Praecox)
SYMPTOMS—Principle signs are moodiness, solitary habits, stupor and excitement, delusions and
hallucinations.
Hallucinations common, especially of hearing. Loss of emotion or, if shown, it is out of place. Actions
are absent or inappropriate. There may be impulsive destructive acts and negativism. Extremities tend to
be cold, blue, and edematous (puffy with fluids). Conscious, but takes little cognizance of what is going
on about him. Delusions frequent but absurd, often of grandeur and persecution. May have attacks of
tears or laughter. There may be excited activity. May remain in a stupor. Grimaces and mannerisms are
frequent. Symptoms sometimes change form.
Schizophrenia affects about 3% of the population at some time in their lives.
CAUSES—This is the most important of the psychoses, and is characterized by a loss of contact with
the environment and by a disintegration of personality. The earlier name for it was dementia praecox.
There are four primary types. A vague sense of being two personalities and ""changed"" occurs in all
types:
1 - Simple schizophrenia: The person becomes dull emotionally, loses ambition, and tends to withdraw.
Yet there is no serious intellectual impairment.
2 - Paranoid schizophrenia: The person develops extensive delusions of persecution. He believes people
are plotting against him.
3 - Catatonic schizophrenia: The person may show stereotyped excitement or simulate a stupor. But he
will clearly remember it, if he later recovers.
4 - Hebephrenic schizophrenia: There are mannerisms, speech anomalies, hysteroid symptoms,
delusions, hallucinations, and often a dreamy, ineffectual reaction.
Some believe schizophrenia is hereditary; others think that only attitudinal, dietetic, and external factors
lead to it (head injuries, complications during birth, reaction to a virus or medicinal drug, environmental
poisons).
A wide range of medicinal drugs can produce schizoid symptoms. It is known that many schizophrenics
had birth complications or a head injury in childhood.
Schizophrenia is also linked to an excess of copper in the body. High copper levels cause vitamin C and
zinc levels to drop. It is believed that a zinc deficiency may be a key factor inducing schizophrenia. A
full 80% of those with this disorder have a deficiency of zinc and an excess of copper and iron in their
body tissues. Supplementation of zinc and manganese are needed to correct this.
Zinc deficiencies occur more frequently in the winter, and this is when this disorder frequently begins.
It is now known that some individuals who, later in life are schizophrenic, had a prenatal zinc
deficiency, from their mother's diet and way of life.
The pineal gland in the brain normally has high levels of zinc, and weakening of this endocrine gland
may be a factor.
Magnesium deficiency may also be involved, since schizophrenics have lower magnesium levels in their
blood; and, when they recover from it, their magnesium levels are higher.
Hypoglycemia appears to be frequently involved in schizophrenia. A fair level supply of blood sugar is
vital, if oxygen is going to be regularly provided to the brain. Yet it is believed that an undersupply of
oxygen is a key factor inducing the disorder. (See ""Hypoglycemia."")
High-quality food, with emphasis on slow-to-digest whole grain products, should be eaten.
Mineral and trace mineral imbalances exist in schizophrenics. A nourishing diet, along with vitamin/
mineral supplementation is needed.
Severe vitamin B (niacin) deficiency (pellagra), with its characteristics such as nervousness, loss of
3
memory, confusion, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and hallucinations—resembles schizophrenia so
closely, that the two disorders probably are the same.
Here is an interesting fact: When experiments were made on prisoners, and they were given no niacin
for extended periods of time before they were again given normal diets, it required 60 times as much
niacin to return them to normal, in order to prevent pellagra.
Severe deficiencies of other B complex vitamins can also produce schizoid symptoms. Severe B
12
deficiency caused difficulty in concentration, poor memory, agitation, hallucinations, and manic or
paranoid behavior. Biotin deficiency causes depression, lassitude, panic, and hallucinations.
Faulty essential fatty acid metabolism or deficiency is another factor leading to schizophrenia. The
remedy was 2-6 tbsp. of linseed oil, in divided doses, given daily. Flaxseed oil, wheat germ oil, or
sunflower seed oil work just as effectively.
Another factor is heavy metal poisoning. This would include lead, copper, mercury,"
disease-general-broken-rib,Broken Rib,"TREATMENT
• Apply some cold water to the bruised area, so it will not swell too much.
• When the water applications have been removed and the skin carefully dried, cut about
six pieces of 1½"" or 2"" adhesive tape. Each piece should be 8""-10"" long.
• Check the ribs, making sure the ends are properly together.
• Center the first piece of tape over the break, stretch firmly and apply to the skin. Repeat
with the second piece, but at a right angle to the first piece. Continue until you have a 12-
point set of tape lines, radiating from the center where the break occurred.
• Try to leave this on for about a month, so it will heal well. A skin rash may develop, but
it will be far less a problem than caring for the break.
—For detailed information on rebuilding the bones, see ""Bones, Strengthening.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Come into the presence of God with praise for the blessings you have, and you
will be helped all the more as you present your requests for help.

SYMPTOMS—A sharp pain, which often starts a day or two after the blow to the rib.
CAUSES—Frequently the rib is not broken, but only has, what is known as, a green splint. This is a
hairline crack. Yet it is still very painful!"
disease-general-osteoporosis,Osteoporosis,"TREATMENT
• Sleep on a firm bed to give support to the spine.
• Do not lift heavy objects. When you do lift, do it carefully and properly.
• Avoid fatigue.
• Look around your house and yard and make necessary changes so you will be less likely
to fall (placement of lights, rugs, treads on stairways, etc.)
—See ""Bones, Strengthening"" for what to do to prevent this problem and to rebuild after it occurs. Also
see osteomalacia under ""Rickets,"" which is sometimes misdiagnosed as osteoporosis.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, and you will be greatly
blessed. Live like Jesus, and you will be sunshine in the lives of others.

(Brittle Bones)
SYMPTOMS—There is skeletal pain (especially in the hip and back), deformities (such as a hump in
the upper back), a stooping and rounding of the shoulders, increased susceptibility to fractures, and a
reduction in height. Do you find that your clothes are getting bigger?
Unfortunately, symptoms are frequently not very obvious until the bones are quite weak.
CAUSES—Osteoporosis is a reduction in the total mass of bone, so that the remaining bone is fragile or
""brittle."" This weakening continues to increase. The bones actually become thinner. Bone formation is
slowed; bone reabsorption increases, causing this loss of bone mass.
About 25-30% of all white females in the U.S. reveal symptoms of this condition, especially after
menopause. Older men, above 50, also have it, but to a lesser degree than women. Osteoporosis is rare in
black men, but somewhat more common in black women.
White women in America tend to lose 30-40% of their bone mass between 55-70.
But younger women should be watchful; research indicates that osteoporosis often begins early in life
rather than just after menopause. (However, bone loss definitely accelerates after that time, due to a drop
in estrogen levels.)
People with larger and denser bones tend to have less trouble with osteoporosis later in life. They started
out with more bony structure.
A major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb
calcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of
certain hormones.
Still other factors include late puberty, early menopause (natural or artificially induced), chronic liver or
kidney disease, and the long-term use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and antiseizure medications.
Smoking is an excellent way to damage your bones.
Compression fractures in the vertebrae occur as bone loss advances. This causes a loss in height and
crowds the nerves, resulting in pain. Nerve damage is possible. Older women often have a hump in the
upper back as a result.
Osteoporosis can also result in loose teeth which fall out, because the jawbone has weakened.
There are two types of this disease:
Osteoporosis, Type I, is thought to be caused by hormonal changes, especially a loss of estrogen.
Osteoporosis, Type II, traces its cause to dietary factors (lack of calcium, vitamin D, etc.), poor
absorption, and intake of foods which block absorption."

Muscular-Skeletal
Part 2
Joints
ARTHRITIS—1
SYMPTOMS—Body stiffness and pain in joints, especially during damp weather, in the morning, or
after strenuous activity. There may be a sharp burning or grinding pain or it may feel like a toothache.
There may be stiffness and/or pain when moving a joint.
CAUSES—Arthritis is the inflammation of one or more joints. The word, ""arthritis,"" covers a number of
disorders, some of which are covered in this present article, which deals the most completely with the
problem.
The most common forms are osteoarthritis (this article), rheumatoid arthritis (which see), gout (which
see), and ankylosing spondylitis (which see). Other diseases which also infect the joints include lupus,
Lyme disease (which see), psoriatic arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome (which see), and Reiter's syndrome.
The various types of arthritis affect the synovial (movable) joints, which are the fingers, toes, wrists,
elbows, hips, and knees. There are also joints between the bones of the spine. Each joint has cartilage
covering over the end of the bone and is bathed continually in synovial fluid, in a capsule.
Osteoarthritis: Cartilage is a smooth, soft, pearly tissue. Among other places, it is found on the ends of
the long bones, and provides a smooth surface for the bones in the joints to slide against.
As a result of years of wear and improper diet, this cartilage becomes pitted, thin, and may even
disappear. There is pain and stiffness. Older people experience this most often, and it generally occurs in
the weight-bearing joints (hips and knees).
The connecting ligaments and muscles, which hold the joint together, become weaker. The joint may
become deformed. There may be pain, but usually no swelling. Later, bony outgrowths may develop.
Osteoarthritis rarely occurs before 40, but affects most people after 60. Sometimes it is so mild as to be
unnoticed. Women have it three times as often as men.
For information on rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, and gout, see their respective articles.
Here is a brief comparative overview:
In osteoarthritis, the cartilage at the end of bones wears down and produces rough, hard, edges of bone
which cause trouble. This generally begins after 40, and 16 million in the U.S. have it.
In rheumatoid arthritis (which see), the cartilage at the end of bones is destroyed, and is replaced with
scar tissue. Then swelling occurs, and the joints may eventually fuse together. While osteoarthritis only
affects individual joints, rheumatoid arthritis ultimately affects all synovial joints in a person's body.
This problem usually begins between 25 and 50, and 3 million in the U.S. are afflicted with it.
Gout (which see) produces extreme pain, usually starting in a big toe (or other smaller toe or finger
joint). This generally does not begin until 40 or after, and 1.5 million experience it. Over 90% are men.
The spondyloarthropathies affect the spine, causing pain, stiffness, joint fusion, and changes in posture.
The most common is ankylosing spondylitis (which see). These difficulties generally start between 20
and 40, and afflict a total of 2.5 million. Men have it over twice often.
Infectious arthritis is the result of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within a joint (most frequently
bacteria or fungi, especially from candida [which see]). The infection can come from injury, surgery, or
disease. There are body aches, chills, and fever, along with throbbing pain in the affected joint. The pain
and infection may spread to other joints. It may strike at any age, and 100,000 in the U.S. have it.
The following suggestions will help one deal with a variety of arthritic conditions:
• Arthritis is the result of a complex of nutritional deficiencies.
• A dietary calcium/phosphorous ratio of 2:1 is ideal, yet can only be attained by taking
calcium supplements (see ""Bones, Strengthening""). Meat is especially bad; it has a ratio of
1:12 (organ meats, such as liver and kidney) is 1:44. So the more meat you eat, the more
calcium you need. It is as simple as that.
• In addition, there is all the acid purines and uric acid in meat. Eventually this
hodgepodge of acids collects in the joints, to such a degree that the bone is eaten away, the
bursa becomes inflamed, etc.
• The sulfur-containing foods (asparagus, eggs, garlic, and onions) helps repair bone,
cartilage, and connective tissue, and aids in the absorption of calcium.
• Eat green leafy vegetables, whole grains, oatmeal, and brown rice. These supply vitamin
K,
• Eat fresh pineapple frequently. The bromelain in it is good for reducing inflammation. It
must be fresh, since freezing or canning destroys the enzyme.
• The most beneficial vegetables include celery, parsley, potatoes, alfalfa, wheat grass,
garlic, comfrey, and endive.
• The most beneficial fruits include bananas, pineapples, sour apples, and sour cherries.
• Foods containing the amino acid, histidine, include wheat, rye, and rice. Histidine helps
remove metals, and many arthritics have high levels of copper and iron in their bodies.
• Eat some form of fiber, such as oat bran, rice bran, flaxseed, etc.
• Vegetable juice therapy is especially helpful for arthritics, and especially for those with
rheumatoid arthritis.
• Repeated juice fasts of 4-6 weeks are recommended, along with about 2 months of an
extremely nourishing diet. The alkaline action of raw juices and vegetable broth dissolves
the accumulation of deposits around the joints and in other tissues.
• Green juice, mixed with carrot, celery, red beet juice, and vegetable broths daily, are
specifics for arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.
• Drink raw potato juice. Slice a potato, with the skin on, cut it into thin slices and place in
a large glass. Fill the glass with cold water and let it stand overnight. Drink the water the
next morning on an empty stomach.
• Potato juice can also be made in an electric juicer. Make it fresh, dilute it 50-50 with
water, and drink first thing in the morning.
• Milk, wheat, eggs, corn, and pork have been shown to produce arthritic symptoms.
• Vitamin C is necessary, to prevent the capillary walls in the joints from breaking down
and causing bleeding, swelling, and pain. Vitamin C is vital to joint health.
• Folic acid, vitamin B , and iron in food help treat the anemia which frequently
12
accompanies arthritis.
• A British research study revealed that arthritic patients had a low pantothenic acid level
in their blood. This important B vitamin should be included in the diet.
• Take 6-8 bromelain tablets a day or, better yet, eat part of a fresh pineapple each day.
This helps reduce or eliminate swelling and inflammation in the soft tissues and the joints
affected by rheumatoid arthritis.
• Helpful herbs include black cohosh, parsley, slippery elm, alfalfa, peppermint, buckthorn
bark, ragwort, burdock root, and chaparral.
• To summarize part of this nutritional data, treatment of arthritis should include calcium
(2000 mg per day; assuming no meat is eaten); vitamin C, to bowel tolerance; B (100 mg,
6
twice a day); B (450 mg, twice a day); vitamin E (1000 IU daily); copper (2mg per day);
3
selenium (300 mcg per day); and zinc (50 mg, three times a day).
• DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is by-product of the wood industry. It can be applied to the
skin above the affected area—to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and promote healing. Only
obtain it from a health food store.
• Reduce the amount of fat in your diet. Avoid dairy products and fatty foods.
• Do not eat meat. The purines and uric acid in it inflame arthritic conditions.
• Avoid salt, caffeine, tobacco, paprika, and citrus fruits.
• Do not eat anything with added sugar.
• A high-protein diet induced arthritis in research on pigs. The first symptoms occurred
within a week.
• Some arthritics are sensitive to foods in the nightshade (solanaceous) family. This
includes eggplant, white potato, bell pepper, tomato, and tobacco. They have solanine,
which interferes with muscle activity. In one research study, 85% of arthritics were
benefited when they stopped using those foods. These foods are sometimes included in
other foods as ""natural ingredients.""
• Chocolate, tea, coffee, and cortisone injections may also cause problems.
• Do not use iron supplements or vitamin/mineral supplements that contain iron. Get your
iron from food (blackstrap molasses, broccoli, etc.)
• Take a free-form amino acid complex regularly, to help repair tissue damage.
• Arthritic patients frequently have liver disorders. This can deter the conversion of
carotene into vitamin A. So additional carotene-rich foods should be eaten.
• Kombucha tea has nutrients needed to strengthen connective tissue; so it tends to relieve
pain, increase energy, and improve mobility in arthritics.
• Exercise is very important in both preventing and treating arthritis. Joints which are not
used tend to stiffen. Practice bending all your joints (not merely the affected ones) in
different positions, 5-10 times twice a day.
• If you are unable to exercise your joints because the pain is too great, carry out an
exercise program in a tub of warm water (93o-98o F.).
• Good posture is also important. Poor posture does not distribute weight evenly and can
intensify the problem.
• Sleeping in a sleeping bag often reduces stiffness and pain in the morning. An electric
blanket may also help. Keeping the body evenly warm at night is important.
• If the blood is too acidic, the cartilage in the joints can dissolve.
• Place cold gel packs on inflamed joints, to relieve pain. Alternate with applications of
heat.
• Charcoal poultices may be applied to affected joints.
• Hot packs applied to stiff joints tend to decrease morning stiffness.
• Hot tubs and baths also provide relief.
• In the morning, take a hot shower, to help relieve morning stiffness.
• Hot castor oil packs are very useful. Heat castor oil in a pan, but do not boil it. Dip white
cotton cloth into it, till saturated. Apply it to the affected area, and cover with a piece of
plastic which is larger than the cloth. Place a heating pad over the area and keep it warm
for 1½ to 2 hours.
• An arthritis liniment may be made in this way: Mix 1 pint alcohol, 1/4 ounce menthol,
and ½ ounce camphor. Rub it on the affected joints, twice a day.
• A 50-50 mix of mineral oil and alcohol is another formula. You can add a tbsp. of
wintergreen oil to the mixture, if you wish.
• The following poultice has been used with good results on swollen joints: Take 3 tbsp. of
granulated slippery elm bark, 1 tbsp. of lobelia, 2 tbsp. of mullein, 1 spoonful of cayenne,
and mix in a bowl. Add hot water to make a paste. Spread it on a cloth and cover the
swollen joints. Over it, wrap a plastic sheet and then a dry towel. Leave it on for ½ to 1
hour or less, if burning sensation becomes unbearable.
• Mix eucalyptus oil with water, and rub on the affected area. Wrap the joint in plastic
wrap, and apply moist heat with hot towels.
• Reduce stress in your life. Worry, anger, and similar emotions weakens your body and
helps induce arthritic problems.
• Chlamydia (which see) has been linked to a form of arthritis that affects young women.
In one study, half the women with unexplained arthritis were found to have chlamydia.
• Overweight increases strain on the joints. Arthritics should try to keep their weight
slightly below average.
• Avoid immunizations. Various immunizations have brought on arthritis.
• Food allergies can cause neck and shoulder pain, imitative of arthritis.
• Silicone gel breast implants can cause arthritis-like symptoms, and induce lupus and
scleroderma. Antibodies develop which attack collagen.
• In its early stages, ulcerative colitis (which see) can produce arthritic-like symptoms.
• Lyme disease (which see) can appear to be arthritis.
• Lupus (which see), an autoimmune disease, can produce arthritis-like symptoms.

—Also see ""Arthritis—1,"" ""Gout—1.""
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS—1
SYMPTOMS—Vague pain, stiffness, weight loss, numbness, and tingling of the hands and feet may
precede its onset.
Swelling, stiffness, redness, and often crippling pain in joints, which eventually may fuse together.
There is fatigue, anemia, weight loss, and fever.
Affected joints sound like crinkling cellophane. In contrast, osteoarthritis joints sound like popping,
clicking, or banging. Joints of the hands, elbows, knees, and ankles are most commonly involved.
Upon awakening in the morning, there may be a joint stiffness which lasts an hour or longer. Swelling
will occur in a specific finger or wrist joints, and also around the joints. Pain may, or may not, be
present.
The condition can worsen or remain the same for years, and later worsen again.
CAUSES—Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory arthritis. It is an autoimmune disorder. So
many acids, purines, etc., have collected in the joints; and the calcium supply has been so low for so
long, that the body gets mixed up—and begins attacking the synovial membranes in the joints. Cartilage,
nearby tissues, and even the bone surfaces are destroyed.
This damaged area is then replaced with scar tissue, which tends to fuse together the joints—making
them immovable.
Oddly enough, this form of arthritis most commonly occurs between the ages of 35 and 45, but may
occur at any age. It also occurs even in children. Two-thirds of the 3 million Americans who have RA
are women. Among those under 18, 70,000 have it, most of them girls.
Causes include poor nutrition, bacterial infection, and/or physical or emotional stress. Stress seems to be
the active agent which initially brings it on. Exposure, overwork, or acute infections can also do it.
Unlike osteoarthritis (which see), which only affects joints here or there, RA affects all the synovial
joints in the body.
In the first year after the disease appears, 75% improve without any treatment at all. Therefore natural
treatments should help the situation even more. Keep in mind that 10% of those with RA become
disfigured in one way or another. So this is a problem which is worth taking the time and effort to reduce
or eliminate.
The likelihood of remission is greater early in the course of the disease. Each attack seems to be worse
than those preceding it.
• It is important that you also read the article on ""Arthritis."" It contains much important
information which also applies to rheumatoid arthritis.
• Take calcium, magnesium, selenium, copper, B , histidine, and bromelain every day.

• Do not take iron supplements (such as ferrous sulfate, which is commonly given for
anemia). These will intensify RA and arthritis.
• Fasting brings temporary relief to RA, but the pain, swelling, and stiffness tend to return
a few days after the fast is ended. However, some recommend a longer vegetable juice and
vegetable broth fast of two or more weeks as having more lasting effects.
• Food allergies can be involved. One study showed that 86% of a group of rheumatoid
arthritics could trace the onset of their problem to allergies; most common were soy
products, milk, eggs, coffee, and sugar foods. Try avoiding all those foods. (See
""Arthritis"" for other helpful and problem foods.)
• One research study noted that peoples who use large quantities of wheat, rye, and oats
tend to have high rates of RA.
• People with RA were found to have lower blood levels of folic acid, protein, and zinc
than other people.
• Lose weight, to reduce the strain on your joints.
• Stretch nylon gloves, worn at night, help keep the hands warm. Better yet, keep your
arms and hands under the covers at night.
• Deep breathing exercises out-of-doors helps those with RA.
• Alternating hot and cold baths help. Give 6 minutes for the hot and 4 minutes for the
cold, to increase blood flow to the area. The healing is in the blood.
• Aloe vera gel helps relieve pain.

ENCOURAGEMENT—By His life and His death, Christ proved that God's justice did not destroy His
mercy; but that sin could be forgiven, that the law is righteous, and, with Christ's help, can be perfectly
obeyed.
ARTICULAR RHEUMATISM, ACUTE
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL—Absolute rest in bed. Abstinence from all solid food for a few days, allowing only ripe
fruits, fruit juices, well-dextrinized (well-cooked) cereals, and malted foods. Avoid meats, animal
broths, beef tea or extracts, eggs, oysters, cheese, and all foods rich in proteins.
COMBAT INFLAMMATORY PROCESS IN JOINTS—Secure active cutaneous circulation by Hot
Blanket Pack and Sweating Wet Sheet Pack; hot Fomentations to the joints, followed by Heating
Compress. Keep him sweating until acute pain ceases and temperature falls.
PREVENT EXTENSION OF THE DISEASE TO THE HEART, LUNGS, PLEURA, AND
MENINGES—by promoting activity of the skin and kidneys, the building up the general vital
resistance, and by carefully administered cold applications. The Hot Blanket Pack, Hot Enemas, Hot
Trunk Pack, following each hot application by Cold Mitten Friction. Administered carefully to all
portions of the body that are free from local inflammation.
ENCOURAGE ELIMINATION—The prolonged sweating bath - given by means of the Hot Blanket
Pack - should be continued for several hours, and is a most valuable measure. He should not be taken out
of the pack suddenly, but gradually; Cold Mitten Friction being applied to each part until good reaction
occurs before uncovering another portion. After rubbing, the surface should be carefully protected by
flannel blankets. Free water drinking and large Enema twice daily.
PAINS IN JOINTS—Hot Blanket Pack followed by dry wrapping (Dry Pack); Fomentation to joints,
repeated every 2 hours; during the interval in between, a well-protected Heating Compress applied as
soon as the Fomentation is removed. Smear joints with Vaseline daily.
FEVER—Hot Blanket Pack continued to full sweating, followed by a Sweating Wet Sheet Pack that is
prolonged for several hours is the best means of lowering the temperature. When the temperature is very
high, the Neutral Bath, at 920-950 F., may be employed. Ice Compress to head and neck. Cold Mitten
Friction or Cold Towel Rub may be given after the Sweating Wet Sheet Pack or the Hot Blanket Pack, 2-
3 times daily.
PROFUSE PERSPIRATION—Do not check during the early stage; simply wipe him with a dry cloth.
If the temperature is very high (1040-1050 F.), the Graduated Bath may be given; the temperature should
not be lowered below 850 F. As the temperature is lowered, he should be rubbed with sufficient vigor, to
prevent chill. The Cool Enema may also be used in connection with the Fomentation to the back. Be
careful not to check perspiration suddenly, nor at all until acute symptoms (of pain, high temperature,
etc.) subside.
DURING CONVALESCENCE—Encourage blood making by Graduated Cold Baths, especially Cold
Mitten Friction.
0 0
HYPERPYREXIA (ELEVATION OF SYSTEMIC TEMPERATURE ABOVE 104 -106 F.)—(1)
Prevent it by Ice Cap, Cold Mitten Friction at 500-400 F., or Cold Towel Rub at 600-500 F., 2-3 times a
day, when temperature rises above 101.50 F. May precede cold application by very Hot Sponging. (2)
Combat it when temperature rises above 101.50 F. by Cold Mitten Friction at 600 F., given every 2 hours
and continuing until temperature falls to 1010 F. Continue application to each part until reddened, so as
to prevent retrostasis. Graduated Baths (1020-850 F.) may be resorted to in obstinate cases, also the Cool
Enema. In all cases apply Ice Cap and Ice Collar, to offset cerebral congestion and coma.
ENDOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS (INFECTION OF HEART MEMBRANES)—The hot
Fomentation (and it should not be very hot) should be applied over the heart for half a minute at
intervals of 1 hour. This should be followed by the Ice bag or Cold Compress above the heart.
CEREBRAL RHEUMATISM—Ice to head; Prolonged Neutral Baths at 920 F.; Colonics at 800 F., 3
times a day; ice to head and neck; Cooling Wet Sheet Pack; Sweating Wet Sheet Pack, repeating 2-3
times a day.
TO PREVENT PERMANENT DAMAGE OF JOINTSSimple flexions (movements) of the joints as
soon as the fever de- clines; short applications of Alternate Compress or Alternate Douche, 2-3 times
daily, after convalescence begins, with a well-protected Heating Compress during the interval in
between.
ARTICULAR AFFUSIONS—Alternate Compress or Alternate Douche 3 times a day, well-protected
Heating Compress during the interval in between; massage; bandaging.
NODOSITIES—Revulsive Douche or Fomentations, 3 times a day; Heating Compress during interval
in between until tenderness is removed; then Alternate Douche, 3 times a day, followed by well-
protected Heating Compress; massage.
ARTHRITIS AND PHLEBITIS—Fomentation over affected part every 2-3 hours for 20 minutes;
Heating Compress during interval in between, wrung very dry and protected with plastic covering.
NEURALGIA—Revulsive Compress, followed by dry cotton poultice; renew every hour or two.
NEURITIS—Complete rest of part; Fomentation every 2-3 hours, followed by well-protected Heating
Compress.
TACHYCARDIA (RAPID HEART BEAT)—Cold Compress over heart for 15 minutes every hour;
avoid hot food and drinks; Ice Bag over heart during hot applications to joints and other parts.
DIARRHEA—Neutral Enema at 950 F., after each bowel movement; cold Abdominal Compress at 600
F., during intervals in between, changed every hour.
GASTRALGIA—Hot and Cold Compress over stomach, heat to area above stomach, cold to spine. Hot
water drinking; dry diet of well-dextrinized (well-cooked) cereals.
PERIOSTATIS and OSTEITIS—Very hot Fomentations for 15 minutes every 2 hours, Heating
Compress during intervals in between, well-wrung and well-protected with flannel and plastic. If
suppuration (pussing) occurs, open it with a knife.
URTICARIA—Sponging with very hot water; Hot salt or alkaline Sponge; Prolonged Neutral Bath.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid Cold Full Baths and Cold Douche.
GENERAL METHOD—Aid the elimination of acids by promoting activity of the skin. This is also the
best means of relieving the articular pains. He should be drenched with water through both the stomach
and rectum, to encourage profuse perspiration and prevent undue increase in the specific gravity of the
blood. Tonic and fever-lowering measures must be used with great care, and so managed as to avoid
retrostasis (a retrograding of his condition). Chilling him will increase the pain. The cold rubbings
(frictions), applied to maintain general vital resistance, must be accompanied by hot applications to the
joints, and, if necessary, more extensive hot applications to the spine or legs, to prevent chilling of the
surface. Those hydrotherapy measures are the most efficient which aid heat elimination by dilating the
surface vessels rather than by lowering the temperature of the skin.
MUSCULAR RHEUMATISM, ACUTE
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
NUTRITION—A nourishing dietary excluding meats; avoid fruits and vegetables at the same meal, all
indigestible foods and dishes, tea, coffee, condiments, and excess of salts. Carefully Graduated Cold Full
Baths daily.
INCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE—This is the most important indication in this
disease, as in malarial infection, in acute rheumatism, and other infectious diseases. Short sweating
procedures of any sort (Full Hot Baths, Steam Baths, etc.), followed by short and graduated cold
applications, are the most important general measures.
SWELLING OF JOINTS—Fomentation 3 times a day; and, during the intervals in between, apply
Heating Compress wrung dry and well-protected by plastic; derivative measures.
PAIN—Revulsive Fan Douche, other pain-relieving measures.
STIFFNESS OF JOINTS—Fomentation 3 times a day, well-protected Heating Compress during
intervals in-between; Alternate Articular Douche [alternate hot and cold spray to afflicted joints];
massage of joints and muscles; Prolonged Neutral Bath.
DRY SKIN—Sweating Wet Sheet Pack, oil rubbing on skin, Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub,
Wet Sheet Rub, Steam Bath, hot-air bath, electric-light bath [heating from electric lights or electric
heater], sunbath.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Do not give very Cold Baths, especially Cold Full Baths.

(Osteomalacia)
SYMPTOMS—Early symptoms include nervousness, numbness in the extremities, leg cramps, and
painful muscle spasms, as well as restlessness, irritability, and profuse sweating.
Later indications include knock-knees, bowed legs, narrow rib cage, protruding breastbone, or scoliosis
(abnormal curvature of the spine). There may be delayed walking, tetany, bony beads along the ribs, and
decaying teeth.
In adults, in addition to the above symptoms, aching joints and generalized weakness may also occur.
CAUSES—Rickets is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D in children. When it occurs in adults, it is
called osteomalacia.
It can result either from not obtaining enough vitamin D in the food or from not getting enough sunlight.
When sunlight strikes the skin, oils there are irradiated, reabsorbed into the blood stream and carried to
the liver, where it is stored and sent throughout the body to strengthen the bones. Without this vitamin,
the body cannot absorb calcium and phosphorous.
The bones cannot retain calcium, so they become soft. This results in deformities when the bones are
required to support weight. Yet weight gain and growth will usually be normal.
The adult form, osteomalacia, generally occurs during pregnancy or breast-feeding. But it may also be
caused by a kidney disease or defect, calcium deficiency, a lack of vitamin D, or inability to utilize it. It
can also occur in those who do not obtain enough sunshine or whose bodies are so low in fat that they
cannot produce the bile needed to absorb the vitamin D in the food.
A deficiency of vitamin C can make the bones less able to retain bone-building minerals.
Osteomalacia is often misdiagnosed as osteoporosis (which see)."
disease-general-bursitis,Bursitis,"TREATMENT
• Initially give ice applications. Apply an ice pack for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours.
• As pain decreases, hot applications can be given. Heat should be applied for 45-60
minutes at a time. It should be as intense as can be tolerated. Hot castor oil packs are
useful (see ""Arthritis"" for information on how to prepare them).
• Sometimes 10 minutes of hot, followed by 10 minutes of cold, applications seems to
work best.
• Follow this with range of motion exercises at least once a day.
• Do not become chilled.
• Keep exercising, so joints will not lock up.
• Do not push yourself too hard or too long during the day. If you are in pain, stop.
• Sometimes rest and immobilization of the joint is needed for a time.
• Vitamin E is beneficial in the treatment of bursitis. The need for protein and vitamins A
and C increases during infection. Vitamin B is also helpful.
12
• DMSO from a health food store will help. Apply it to the skin of the affected area.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord has not changed. He is true, merciful, and faithful to fulfill His
Word. Determine that you will stand with Him in the battles of life. He is the best friend you will ever
have, and deserves your love and obedience.

SYMPTOMS—Swelling, tenderness, and possible redness. A dull persistent ache that increases with
movement. Immense pain in the affected area, which frequently limits motion.
It most often occurs in shoulder joint and less often in the hip joint, in the elbows, or feet.
CAUSES—Bursitis is the inflammation of the liquid-filled sac, called a bursa, found within joints,
muscles, tendons, and bones. These sacs normally help muscular movement occur.
Overstimulation of the bursa causes the synovial membrane to produce excess fluid. This distends the
bursa, which causes the discomfort.
Injury to the area is a common cause, but chilling of the area during the day, especially at night can also
lead to it. Bursitis can also be caused by chronic overuse, calcium deposits in the bursa wall, reactions to
certain foods or airborne allergies. In some instances, suddenly working tight muscles can do it; it is
called a stretched muscle.
According to where it is centered, bursitis has many names: housemaid's knee, tennis elbow, policeman's
heel, frozen shoulder, or beat knee.
The lowly bunion (caused by friction in tight shoes) is also a form of bursitis. A bursa sac on the joint of
the big toe becomes inflamed.
Athletes and older people are most likely to get bursitis, but it can happen to anyone at any age.
What is the difference between bursitis and tendonitis (which see)? Both produce pain in the shoulder,
etc.
Bursitis generally exhibits a dull persistent ache that increases with movement. Tendonitis causes a
sharp pain during movement, and is most likely to be caused to over-reaching for something. But it can
also be caused by calcium deposits pressing against a tendon. There is no swelling and fluid
accumulation, as with bursitis. See ""Tendonitis"" for more on that problem."
disease-general-ankylosing-spondylitis,Ankylosing Spondylitis,"TREATMENT
• Eliminate meat from the diet. Reduce the tensions; eliminate the anger, worry, and
feverish way of life.
• Go on a 3-day fast of vegetable juices and green drinks. Clean out the bowels with
enemas or colonics.
• Improve the diet to a simple, nourishing one, as discussed elsewhere in this book.
• Include a vitamin/mineral supplement, and also a calcium supplement. Essential fatty
acids are important. Vitamins A, C, E, selenium, and zinc are needed to rebuild the
immune system.
• Learn to relax and appreciate the blessings of life which you have.
ENCOURAGEMENT—In this life, you will ever have disappointments, but know that Jesus is the
living, risen, Saviour. He is your Redeemer, and He loves you deeply. Trust your life to Him, and you
will be safe.

(Rheumatoid Spondylitis, Marie-
Strumpell Disease)
SYMPTOMS—Weight loss, fatigue, malaise, low back pain, sacroiliac pain, back leg pain, stiffness in
the back (especially early in the morning), aching and stiffness in the hips and shoulders.
CAUSES—This is an autoimmune disorder. So many poisons have accumulated in the body from
wrong eating, overwork, and stress that the immune system attacks the tissues lining the joints.
Uric acid toxins, a by-product of eating meat, accumulate in the joints. They form crystals, which result
in inflammation and pain.
For some reason, tension and stress help bring on the pain and stiffness.
Malnutrition can also be involved. When proper nutrients are lacking, toxins tend to accumulate in the
body. A lack of minerals (especially calcium, magnesium, and silicon) can strengthen the problem."
disease-general-shin-splints,Shin Splints,"TREATMENT
• Athletic trainers call it RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Do this for 20-30
minutes. Prop up the leg, wrap it with an Ace bandage, and place the ice pack on it for 20-
30 minutes.
• An alternate method is a contrast bath of one minute, of ice, followed by a minute of
heat. Do this for at least 12 minutes. This is especially good for pain in the inner leg
(rather than the front where the shin splints occur).
• Massage the area near the shin splint pain, but not on it. If you rub on it, the
inflammation will worsen. Sit on the floor and lightly stroke on the sides several times.
Then wrap your hands around the calf and, with your finger tips, stroke deeply around on
each side of the shin from ankle to knee. Do the entire area, pressing as deeply as possible.
• Try to correct flat feet or very high arches, if you can. They can also cause shin splints.
PREVENTION—Try to avoid a lot of hard activity on unyielding surfaces, such as concrete. Even
carpet on concrete can cause problems. Grass or dirt is better than asphalt; asphalt is better than
concrete.
Wear good, comfortable shoes; and when they start wearing down, buy new ones.
Stretch your calves and Achilles tendon frequently. This helps prevent shin splints. Shortened calf
muscles throw more weight and stress forward to the shins.
To stretch your calves, place your hands on a wall, extend one leg behind the other, and press the back
heel slowly to the floor. Do this 20 times, and repeat on the other leg.
To stretch your Achilles tendons, have both feet flat on the ground, about 6 inches apart. Bend your
ankles and knees forward while keeping the back straight. When you achieve tightness, hold it for 30
seconds. Repeat 10 times.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Only by following Christ's example can we have genuine happiness. He alone
can strengthen us for the trials of life; He alone can guide us through them.

SYMPTOMS—Pain in the shins of one or both legs. There may, or may not, be a specific area of
tenderness; pain, and aching will be felt in the front of the lower leg after, or during, activity.
CAUSES—The experts are not clear as what shin splints are. They may be an irritation to the tendon
which attaches the muscle to the bone. Or they may be a muscle irritation or the beginning of a stress
fracture.
Active people have shin splints. For example, 28% of long distance runners have them and 22% of
aerobic dancers.
They are caused by excessive walking, running, or jumping on a hard surface. But other factors include
poor shoes, fallen arches, insufficient warm-up, poor posture, faulty walking and running techniques, or
overstraining.
Sometimes the early stages of stress fractures are thought to be shin splints or vice verse. But there is a
difference: Stress fractures begin pinpoint pain, about the size of a dime or quarter, around or on a bony
area. A shin splint is a generalized pain or aching discomfort up and down the whole shin. But, if the
problem is not stopped, shin splints can develop into stress fractures."
disease-general-tendonitis,Tendonitis,"TREATMENT
• When this occurs, you have to stop the activity for a time, even though that activity is
your primary employment or sport (window washing, long-distance swimming, etc.).
• But do not rest too long, or the muscle tends to atrophy. And while you are resting, do
not do absolute rest.
• Soak in a warm bath or a whirlpool bath. Warm the tendon before stressful activity
decreases the soreness.
• Place a warm, damp towel over the area (knee, etc.). Put plastic over that, a heating pad
on top, and finally a loose elastic bandage. Keep it in place for 2-6 hours, with the pad set
on low. During this time, try to keep the injured part higher than your heart.
• An alternate method is to wrap the painful area in an Ace bandage, but not too tight or
kept on too long. Proper circulation must be maintained.
• Raise the affected area, to help control swelling.
• Before a workout, carefully warm up. This is important. The tub bath, mentioned above,
can precede the warming-up exercises out in the field.
• Before hard exercise, carefully stretch your muscles, to limber them up. Stretching helps
prevent the shortening which accompanies exercise.
• Ice can be placed on the area after exercise, to reduce swelling and pain. But those with
diabetes, heart disease, or problems with blood vessels, should be cautious about using
ice. It can constrict blood vessels and loosen clots.
• If possible, switch to a different exercise format for a time. (Runners can switch to
cycling, etc.)
• Strengthen your muscles generally.
• Whatever your activity, take breaks occasionally and walk around or do something
differently. This helps relax your body and improves circulation. Breathe deep and enjoy
life for a moment.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The temple of God is opened in heaven, and the threshold is flushed with His
glory. He will help all who will surrender their lives to Him.
Section 10
Muscular-Skeletal
Part 4
Muscles

SYMPTOMS—Pain in a tendon. Whereas simple muscle soreness soon goes away, tendon pain can
continue on for some time.
CAUSES—A tendon is used in the same repetitive motion while ignoring initial indications of tiredness."
disease-general-restless-leg-syndrome,Restless Leg Syndrome,"SYMPTOMS—A chronic sensation of discomfort in the legs, generally between the knees and feet,
which urges a person to move his legs. There may be twitching of the leg muscles or deep creeping or
crawling sensations. Sometimes it feels like a pain, cramps, or aches.
It tends to occur shortly after retiring at night or after sitting still for quite some time. Sometimes this
happens several times a night.
CAUSES—Restless leg syndrome is not a serious neurological disorder, and moving the legs or walking
around a little terminates the sensation for a time.
Women and older people have the syndrome more often than men, and a full 5% of the U.S. population
have experienced it. Yet the cause is not certain. Mild weakness of the legs may be present.
It seems to be related to iron deficiency, exposure to cold, stress, heredity, and motion sickness. It also
seems to be related to pulmonary disease, stomach operations, diabetes, and uremia.
Very likely, there is a circulatory factor involved: Blood circulation is impeded in the legs or blood is
being drawn in excessive amounts, to care for a problem in the trunk.
It is obvious that the solutions, listed below, are keyed to improving leg circulation and bettering the
diet:
IMMEDIATE TREATMENT—
• Move your feet back and forth for a few moments.
• Rotate the feet back and forth momentarily.
• Get up and walk about for a couple minutes. This seems to work best at night, when you
have been trying to sleep.
• Change position in bed. It has been noted that some people experience the problem more
often when they sleep in certain positions.
• Some find using a heating pad helps; others do better by soaking their feet in cold water.
LONGER-TERM CARE—It is known that drinking coffee is a significant factor, so stop using
caffeine products.
Stop smoking. Studies reveal it is also a factor.
Some studies have shown folic acid and vitamin E to be helpful.
There may be a relationship between this problem and iron deficiency. But be sure your iron is from
food, not chemical supplements, or you can initiate other physical problems.
It would be well to improve your general diet and take a multivitamin supplement daily.
Do not eat much salt.
Never eat big meals before bedtime. This draws the blood to the stomach, so that you do not rest well. It
can also lead to a nighttime heart attack.
Walk before going to bed. Better yet, walk outside in the fresh air. This will help you sleep better.
Some sponge the legs with cold water.
Others take a warm soaking bath before bedtime. Do not let your bare feet touch the cold floor
afterward.
You may wish to wear knee socks.
Do not take sleeping drugs. They only add another problem to your life.
Possibly massage your legs just before climbing into bed.
Get plenty of rest.
Reduce your overall stress level.
Avoid prolonged exposure to the cold, which increases the need for additional healing blood to the legs.
Avoid overusing the legs. Strenuous exercise seems to increase the problem.
Avoid narrow, pointed, shoes and also high heels.
Sluggish venous blood flow may be problem. Do not cross your legs; lie down every so often and rest
your legs. See ""Varicose Veins"" for more information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All heaven unites in praising God. Let us learn the song of the angels now,
that we may later sing it when we join their shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist, ""While I live
will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being."""
disease-general-claudication,Claudication,"TREATMENT
• Take vitamin C, to bowel tolerance; vitamin E and B ; chromium; and selenium.
6
• Maintain a total vegetarian diet, free from grease and animal foods. Avoid vegetable oils
also. Because of the connection between claudication and blood vessel diseases, the life
you save may be your own (see ""Arteriosclerosis"" and related articles on the heart and
blood vessels).
• Using nicotine is ruinous to the health in several ways; choking off circulation to the
limbs is one of them. Those who smoke are 6 times more likely to develop claudication
(also see Buerger's Disease).
• It appears that abnormally high blood viscosity can be a primary cause of poor blood
flow. The solution is to drink lots of water and use a diet low in fats, sugars, and
concentrated foods; that is, those which have a very low moisture content.
• Stress also reduces blood viscosity, so avoid stress.
• A regular exercise program is very helpful, especially for those who do it every day. See
""Muscle Cramps"" for some sample exercises. Ten repetitions of the exercises should be
done at least once a day.
• In addition to other exercises, take a daily walk. Build up to a total of an hour, each
morning and evening.
• For those who can take them, hot baths are helpful. Always keep the head cool with cool
washcloths that are changed frequently.
• Helpful herbs include ginseng and cayenne.
—Also see ""Muscle Cramps,"" which, in the legs, have the same symptoms. Also see ""Arteriosclerosis""
and related articles.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Come apart and worship God. The everlasting assurance shall be ours that you
have a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

(Intermittent Claudication)
SYMPTOMS—Cramping pain, weakness, and tension in a limb (usually the calves) after muscular
exercise. Upon resting, the pain always ceases. Typically, after a few moments of rest, the person can
begin walking again.
CAUSES—Intermittent claudication (also simply called claudication) is often a symptom of something
more serious: arteriosclerosis of the femoral and popliteal arteries. Other causes include Buerger's
disease (which see), or other occlusive arterial diseases of the limbs. Diabetics tend to have claudication
more than the average.
High blood pressure (above 160 systolic or 90 diastolic) triples the risk of claudication (see
""Hypertension"").
Diagnosis of claudication is done by a physician, by taking the ""pedal pulse."" This is the pulse at the
instep of each foot. These pulses should be strong and equal, but if one or both is weak or absent, then
there is claudication."
disease-general-side-stitches,Side Stitches,"TREATMENT
• Stop what you are doing, and let your muscles calm down. Exhale deeply, and take slow
deep breaths in and out. You may wish to massage your side as you do this.
• Learn to breath from the diaphragm more, and less from the chest. This is part of the
problem.
• Do not do very strenuous exercise closer than 2 hours to a meal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Though now He has ascended to the presence of God, and shares the throne of
the universe, Jesus has lost none of His compassionate nature. He wants to comfort and help you just
now.

(Pain in the Side)
SYMPTOMS—A sharp, temporary, pain in the side.
CAUSES—This pain is caused by a spasm in the diaphragm, when this muscle between your chest and
abdomen does not receive enough oxygen.
Running is a common immediate cause. The dual pressure from the contracted belly muscles (caused by
the raised knee during running) and the expanded lungs from above (caused by deeper breathing) can
momentarily shut off blood flow to the diaphragm. This causes it to cramp.
Not breathing evenly can cause you to get these cramps, even when heavily laughing.
However, the pain can also come from trapped gas in the intestines.
If the pain is only on the right side, it may be due to temporary lack of oxygen to the liver."
disease-general-fibromyalgia-syndrome,Fibromyalgia Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Maintain a well-balanced diet.
• Do not drink coffee, tea, cola drinks, chocolate, or take pain relievers. Avoid all types of
drugs; they only add to your problems. If any of these have been part of your diet, the
symptoms may worsen for a time when you drop them, but persevere and you will feel
better for having done so.
• Do not eat meat, dairy products, white-flour products, processed food, or any food high
in saturated fats.
• Avoid wheat and brewer's yeast until your symptoms fade.
• Poor absorption of food is involved with this problem; so eat slowly of good nourishing
food, and chew it well. Be sure to take vitamin/mineral supplementation. Magnesium is
important.
• Drink plenty of liquids, including quality water.
• Food and chemical allergies can be involved. Try to search out yours and avoid them.
• Learn to rest and be relaxed. Be able to relax after the work. Go out and walk in the fresh
air, and thank God for your blessings. Indeed, count them all, one by one, and thank Him
for them all.
• Determine what your problems are and solve them, know you are working toward
solving them, or learn to live with them and no longer be bothered by them.
• A fair amount of muscular activity helps relax a person mentally and emotionally. Enjoy
out-of-door activities, such as gardening or raising flowers. You need a regular amount of
regular daily exercise, not a hard workout every so many days. Building up such a regular
exercise program will do much to alleviate the problem.
• Take a hot and cold shower each morning, to stimulate circulation and help reduce
morning stiffness. Cold showers are actually better than hot ones for reducing
fibromyalgia pains.
• Helpful herbs include comfrey, alfalfa, hop, skullcap, white willow bark, and valerian.
• Physicians prescribe antidepressants for fibromyalgia. These can cause side effects
which are not helpful.
—Also see ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"" and ""Depression.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Real happiness is found only in being good and doing good. The purest,
highest, enjoyment comes to those who faithfully fulfill their appointed duties. Living for God is the best
way to live.

(Chronic Muscle Pain Syndrome,
Fibromyositis, Fibrositis, Tension Myalgia)
SYMPTOMS—Anxiety, depression, tension, fatigue, chronic muscle aches and pain, joint swelling,
headaches (sometimes migraine), irritable bowels, sleep disturbances, and stiffness.
The pain is described as burning, throbbing, shooting, and stabbing. Pain and stiffness are greatest in the
morning.
Depression appears to be a key factor. Other symptoms include menstrual problems, palpitations,
memory impairment, dizziness, dry eyes and mouth, frequent changes in eyeglasses, and impaired
coordination.
Lifting or climbing stairs seems hard to do.
The existence of ""tender points"" is a distinctive symptom (see below).
CAUSES—Fibromyalgia is more of a set of symptoms than a disease, and it is primarily caused by
stress. Women have it more often than men.
Often mistaken for arthritis, rheumatism, or Epstein-Barr syndrome, fibromyalgia causes the muscles
and joints to tighten up when under stress. The emotions have a powerful effect on the body.
Those experiencing this problem frequently have shallow sleep. Muscle spasms and pain in various
places may occur at night (or during the day).
Then there are the so-called ""tender points."" These symptoms are unique to this disease, unlike any other
disease. There are 9 pairs of specific points where muscles are especially sensitive to the touch. Here are
those 9 locations:
In muscles at base of skull, neck, upper back, or mid-back. On the side of the elbow, around the lower
vertebra of the neck, at the insertion of the second rib, in the upper and outer muscles of the buttocks,
around the upper part of the thigh bone, at the middle of the knee joint.
Those with fibromyalgia experience so many sleep problems (apnea, bruxism, restless leg syndrome,
etc.), that they often have chronic fatigue.
The symptoms often begin in young adulthood, develop gradually, and slowly increase in intensity until
many become incapacitated by the problem.
Sometimes the syndrome disappears; other times it is chronic; and, in some cases, it is comes back in
recurring flare-ups.
The cause is not really known, but chronic depression of spirits seems to be involved.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (which see) is similar to fibromyalgia, but the former is keyed to chronic
fatigue and the latter to chronic pain."

disease-general-hernia,Hernia,"TREATMENT
• First, a truss can be purchased and worn. This is not a very practical solution, but may be
necessary for a time if funds are not available for an operation.
• Second, a surgical operation can be performed. This is often the best solution, if done by
a properly trained physician.
• Third, simple remedies may be applied which may, or may not, succeed. If they do not,
then an operation can be performed.
Here are some suggestions:
• If you are overweight, you need to go on a cleansing program, to lose some of it and
cleanse the system.
• Go on a nourishing diet, supplemented by vitamins and minerals and avoiding all grease,
meat, and junk foods.
• Begin a program of exercises each day, to strengthen your muscles (abdominal or leg,
according to where the hernia is). For example, push-ups from the knees will strengthen
the abdominal muscles.
• You may wish to try an astringent tea: Make a very strong tea of white oak bark,
consisting of one cup of finely broken bark to one quart of water. Boil it 2 minutes and let
stand 2 hours. Strain, and add 1 tsp. of alum powder. Wet a folded piece of cloth in the tea
and place it over the hernia. Cover with plastic and hold in place with a truss, elastic
bandage, or adhesive tape. Using clean cloth, repeat this about 4 times a day for a month.
The tannin of the bark and alum will tend to pull together and thicken the area. This may,
or may not, close the area.
• You may also try a poultice made of comfrey leaves, bistort root, and giant Solomon's
seal root. Renew every 12 hours, and keep it on continually for a month.
• You may instead alternate with the application of poultice at night and the compress
during the day, for a month.
• Shave grass tea compress may also be used.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Through all our trials, we have a never-failing Helper. He does not leave us
alone to struggle with temptation and battle with evil. Give Him all your heart and hear Him say, ""Fear
not; I am with you.""

(Rupture; Abdominal Hernia; Femoral Hernia)
SYMPTOMS—Visual awareness of the problem. In the case of a strangulated hernia, there is pain,
vomiting, and abdominal distention.
CAUSES—A weak spot exists or develops in a muscular wall. An abdominal hernia occurs in the
abdomen, often in the lower left or lower right. A femoral hernia occurs in the femoral muscle of the
upper front leg. The weak spot slowly enlarges and becomes an opening.
If in the abdomen, a loop of intestine can protrude from it at times. Unless corrected, such a condition
will grow progressively worse. A strangulated hernia occurs when a loop of intestine is caught in it and
becomes pinched, blocking the intestinal passage. Gangrene of the bowel, peritonitis, and death may
result if a strangulated hernia is not given prompt surgical attention.
A hernia in a child is less serious, and the opening may repair itself if the protruding bowel loop is
pushed back and held in place by a firm band or adhesive strap for a few months."
disease-general-umbilical-hernia,Umbilical Hernia,"TREATMENT
• If the hernial ring is larger than your finger tip, surgery is needed, to correct it.
• If the defect is about the size of the diameter of your finger tip, the following method has
been used with good success, to heal it at home without surgery:
• Place a golf-ball sized ball of virgin wool on the hernia and tape it firmly down to the
level of the skin's surface.
• Three times a day, remove the wool ball. Make sure the fat is pushed back into the belly
cavity; carefully use your finger to do this.
• At the same time, rub the hernial ring in a rotary fashion for several minutes, to irritate it.
• Over a period of several weeks or months, the defect will fill in and entirely heal; so no
surgery will be needed.

(Omphalocele)
SYMPTOMS—A grape to basketball sized skin sac in the belly button.
CAUSES—""Omphalos"" means navel, and ""kele"" means hernia. This sac in the navel, which is a birth
defect, is lined with the membrane lining of the abdominal cavity (the peritoneum). It may contain fat
and/or intestinal loops that can be pushed back into the abdominal cavity.
This flaw, called a ""hernial ring,"" occurs more frequently than might be expected. The mother did not
receive enough vitamin A and/or zinc during pregnancy."
disease-general-pelvic-congestion,Pelvic Congestion,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC APPLICATIONS—Graduated cold applications; hot vaginal irrigation, 10-15 minutes, twice
daily; Hot Blanket Pack to legs with cold pelvic pack (Wet Sheet Pack over pelvic area), continued to
sweating stage, followed by cold friction or Wet Sheet Rub.
PAIN—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath at 950-970 F., for 15-20 minutes.
LEUKORRHEA—In addition to the above measures, antiseptic vaginal irrigation. In certain cases,
cool irrigation, at 750-650 F., produces better results than hot irrigation. Constipation and portal
congestion must be relieved. Cervical catarrh and erosions often require the use of the curette [a spoon-
shaped scraping instrument for scraping foreign matter from a cavity].
ACUTE INFLAMMATION—If attacks of inflammation occur, rest in bed; Hot Hip or Leg Pack; hot
and cold pelvic compress or hot and cold pelvic pack."

extremities, sexual excess.
GENERAL APPLICATIONS—Rest in a horizontal position, with proper general treatment for any
existing general or local morbid condition, as anemia, neurasthenia, hysteria, enteroptosis, constipation,
or any discoverable pelvic disease. If caused by neuralgia: Give hot Hip and Leg Pack or very hot
Revulsive Sitz, 3 times a day; hot water bottle over seat of pain and heat to feet and legs. Very hot
vaginal irrigation.
If due to chronic congestion in a pelvic organ: Hot Hip and Leg Pack every 2-4 hours, with abdominal
Heating Compress and heating leg packs during the interval between.
If due to inflammation or acute congestion: Hot Hip and Leg Pack or Hot and Cold Pelvic Pack every 2-
4 hours, followed by continuous heat to legs with cooling compress to lower abdomen, external genitals
and inner surfaces of thighs. Vaginal irrigation at 1050 F. for 15 minutes, every 3 hours. Apply Ice Bag
over seat of pain during the hot vaginal irrigation and Hot Hip and Leg Pack.

Endocrine
Part 1
Adrenals"
disease-general-hypoglycemia,Hypoglycemia,"TREATMENT
• Refined starches, sugars, and a high-meat diet wear out the adrenals. Too much sugar
shocks the adrenal cortex, and the resulting physical reaction is to crave still more sugar.
• Stop eating or using meat, nicotine, alcohol, chocolate, soft drinks, black tea, and
sugared and fat foods. Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco produce wide swings in blood sugar
levels.
• Read the labels at the grocery store, and avoid dextrose, dextrin, lactose, maltose,
sucrose, fructose, modified food starch, corn syrup, corn sweetener, cornstarch, and
natural sweetener. Only use honey and molasses in small amounts. Also stay away from
sorbitol, hexanol, mannitol, and glycol.
• Too much salt also exhausts the adrenals and causes a loss of potassium, leading to
lower blood sugar.
• Eat natural foods, the ones you should have been eating to begin with. Whole grains, raw
and simply cooked vegetables, some fresh fruit. But eat in moderation starchy foods, such
as corn, noodles, pasta, white rice, hominy, and yams.
• Eat a high-fiber diet and vegetables that are raw or steamed. These are good for you:
beans, lentils, brown rice, white potatoes, soy products, and fruits.
• Useful fruits include apricots, apples, bananas, grapefruit, lemons, cantaloupes, and
persimmons. For example, eat a raw apple instead of applesauce, for the apple has more
fiber which will help keep blood sugar stabilized.
• Licorice acts like cortin and helps the blood sugar. Bilberry and wild yam help control
insulin levels. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Spirulina tablets, taken between meals,
help stabilize blood sugar.
• During a blood sugar reaction, eat something that has both fiber and protein, such as rice
or bran crackers with almond butter. Fiber alone (popcorn, rice, oat bran, crackers, ground
flaxseed, and psyllium husks) has the ability to slow down a hypoglycemic reaction. A
half hour before each meal, eat some of this high fiber, to stabilize blood sugar.
• Once a month, go on a fresh vegetable juice fast for a day. Take enemas with some
added lemon juice at that time. If a reaction starts to occur, reach for the fiber, protein
powder, or spirulina.
• Avoid stressful situations. You may have a milk allergy, which often accompanies this
disease.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus cares for each individual as though there were not another person on the
earth. He will help you also, as you seek Him earnestly with all your heart.

(Low Blood Sugar)
SYMPTOMS—Confusion, depression, nervousness, anxiety, antisocial behavior, emotional instability,
exhaustion, headaches, impatience, inability to cope, fears, craving for sugar, faintness, dizziness.
Symptoms especially occur a few hours after eating sweets or fats. The more that is eaten and the longer
the span before the symptoms occur, the worse they are.
CAUSES—The problem is adrenal exhaustion. The cause is too much stress, worry, and an excess of
undigested sugars, starches, proteins, and dairy products. The cortin hormone is depleted, so food cannot
be digested properly.
People consume large quantities of sugars, caffeine, soft drinks, and alcohol. These all contain simple
sugars, and insufficient amounts of complex carbohydrates. Add to this: high stress levels, and the two
adrenal glands become exhausted.
Hypoglycemia can be inherited, but more often it is brought on by an inadequate diet (and is then called
functional hypoglycemia). However, there are several other physical problems which can weaken
adrenal function and help bring on hypoglycemia. These include weaknesses in the thyroid, liver,
kidneys, pituitary, and pancreas. Immune deficiency and candidiasis can also lead to it. Other causes
include smoking and large amounts of caffeine.
Hypoglycemia is sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as asthma, allergies, fatigue syndrome, stomach,
intestinal, weight problems, or mental or nervous disorders.
Half the people, over 50, who have hypoglycemia, are hypothyroid."
disease-general-addison-s-disease,Addison'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• Maintain a good nourishing diet. Include Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp for trace
minerals. Fresh, raw, and cooked greens and garlic should be part of your regime.
• Avoid tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, and soft drinks. Do not use sugar foods, fried foods,
processed or junk foods. Do not eat meat.
• Avoid stress! This is very important, for stress is hard on weak adrenals. Take time for
prayer and the study of God's Word, the Bible. He can help you solve the problems about
you.
• Stress released ACTH through the pituitary, which can raise blood pressure, stores
sodium and excretes potassium. Water retention in the tissues is another result.
—Compare the opposite of Addison's Disease, which is ""Cushing's Disease"" (which see).
ENCOURAGEMENT—All your habits are to be brought under the control of a mind that is itself
under the control of God. In the strength which trust in Christ imparts, we can fulfill God's will for our
lives.

(Adrenal Underactivity)
SYMPTOMS—Dizziness, fainting, nausea, loss of appetite, moodiness, decrease in body hair, inability
to cope with stress. Slight darkening and discoloration of the skin is more noticeable when body parts
are exposed to the sun. This would include forehead, knees, elbows, scars, skin folds and creases (on the
palms, etc.). The mouth and freckles may appear darker. The hair becomes darker.
Bands of pigment run the length of the nails.
Reduced adrenal function (resulting either from Addison's or Cushing's Disease) can result in weakness,
headaches, memory problems, dizziness, allergies, food cravings, and blood sugar disorders.
CAUSES—Both the adrenal underactivity of Addison's Disease and the overactivity of Cushing's
Disease are caused by problems in the function of the adrenal glands.
Continued use of cortisone drugs for arthritis and asthma, etc., damage the adrenals. Those drugs cause
them to shrink in size and not work properly. Yet, surprisingly enough, the shrunken glands can still
overproduce and cause Cushing's Disease or underproduce and cause Addison's.
There is a way you can pinpoint whether or not your adrenals are functioning normally:
The systolic is the first number in a blood pressure reading, and the diastolic is the second. For example,
120/80. The systolic should be 10 points higher when you are standing than when you are lying down.
Lie down and rest for 5 minutes, and then have someone take your blood pressure. Then stand up and
have it immediately taken again. The blood pressure will probably be somewhat higher.
But if it is lower when standing than when laying flat, the adrenals are not working properly. The lower
it is, the worse the condition of the adrenals.
You will want to contact a medical professional. Addison's is a chronic condition which needs to be
continually worked with. You may moderate the problem, but it is never fully eliminated."

• See ""Addison's Disease"" for more information. The objective is to live better so the
adrenals, whether working too fast or too slow, can be helped to normalize.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We have not a high priest who is so high, so lifted up, that He cannot notice us
or sympathize with us; but Jesus is one who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. He

SYMPTOMS—Rounded ""moon"" faces, heavy abdomen and buttocks, thin limbs, The muscles seem
weak and wasting away. The eyelids may appear swollen and round; red spots may appear on the face.
The skin seems to get thinner, and produces stretch marks and bruising.
Body hair grows faster, and women may grow mustaches and beards. Healing is more difficult and

CAUSES—See ""Addison's Disease"" for more information.
There are two adrenal glands in your body. One is on top of each kidney. Each one is remarkably small,
and weighs only about one-fifth of an ounce.
The outer thick ""rind"" of each adrenal is the cortex. It produces cortisone. The inner portion is called the
medulla; it secretes adrenaline (epinephrine) when stress occurs."
disease-general-cystic-fibrosis,Cystic Fibrosis,"TREATMENT
• In addition to the above instructions, the CF patient should consider the following:
• Eat a nourishing diet, high in raw fruits and vegetables and with adequate amounts of
carbohydrates, protein, and vitamin/mineral supplements. A problem is that those with CF
do not absorb food properly. They need to eat more than other people, in order to absorb
the needed nutrients.
• Include germanium (found in garlic and onions), selenium, and vitamin E.
• Drink plenty of liquids and an adequate amount of salt in hot weather.
• Do not eat processed or junk food of any type. Avoid tobacco, alcohol, etc.

DIABETES—1
SYMPTOMS—Diabetes insipidus: Extreme thirst and enormous quantities of urine, regardless of how
much water is consumed.
Diabetes mellitus - Type I: (insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes): Excessive hunger, thirst, urination,
depression, weakness, blurred vision, dry mouth, and vomiting.
Diabetes mellitus - Type II: (maturity-onset diabetes): Unusual thirst, frequent urination, general
weakness, obesity, skin disorders, boils, blurred vision, and dry mouth.
CAUSES—Diabetes is a major problem; entire books have been written on the subject. We can only
touch on the subject here.
Of the two types of diabetes, diabetes insipidus is the more rare and is caused by an inadequately
functioning pituitary hormone (vasopressin) or kidneys which somehow cannot respond properly to it.
Diabetes mellitus is the third largest killer in the U.S., and is caused by a defect in the production of
insulin by the pancreas. Without insulin, the body cannot utilize glucose, which is an important blood
sugar. A blood glucose level above 180 mg. percent causes excess sugar to spillover into the urine and
make it sweet. (Mellitus means ""sweet."") Diabetes comes from a Greek word for ""flow through,"" since
diabetics produce so much urine.
Some people can develop diabetes mellitus as a result of stress, obesity, or pregnancy. Certain medicinal
drugs can also cause it: oral contraceptives, adrenal corticosteroids, phenytoin, or thiazide diuretics. A
diet high in sugar and white flour can lead to diabetes. Parasites (especially in children) can also do it.
Hypothyroidism can also cause it.
It is of interest that people who eat much sugar eventually cannot taste it as well; so they pour on more
sugar! But Type II diabetes sufferers also lack this sugar-tasting discernment. Leave off the sugar, and
learn to enjoy the natural flavors in your food.
Because the diabetic cannot utilize glucose for energy, he loses weight and is weakened by excess
consumption of his protein and fat stores. Because of this, he may be very hungry and eat large amounts
of food.
• Stop eating sugar, white-flour products, greasy food, meat, eggs, cheese, excess
vegetable oil, as well as rancid nuts and seeds. Totally avoid tobacco and those who use it.
Because it restricts circulation, it will aggravate your condition.
• Eat smaller meals (if necessary, eat them more frequently), and chew the food
thoroughly. Do not eat late in the evening. Overeating can induce diabetes or increase it,
once contracted.
• Vegetable broths and fresh fruit are nourishing. A high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet will
reduce the need for insulin. (A low-fiber diet can bring on diabetes.) It will also lower the
amount of fat in the blood. Get your protein from vegetable sources.
• Onions and green beans appear to lower blood sugar. A diet high in raw food is also
helpful. One individual dropped his insulin dosage from 60 to 15 units per day, by
increasing his raw food intake.
• But do not eat fruits and melons in large amounts. Do not eat apples or bananas. Do not
eat milk and sugar combinations. Coffee can induce very high blood sugar levels. A fat-
free diet will help reduce blood sugar.
• Eat your meals at regular times, and do not be in a rush to swallow the food. The quicker
you eat, the higher goes the blood sugar.
• Eat raw garlic every day, to reduce your blood sugar.
• Do not take large amounts of niacin (vitamin B ), B (thiamin), PABA (para-
3 1
aminobenzoic acid, another B vitamin), or vitamin C. But do take them in normal
amounts.
• Get enough exercise; it will improve circulation, which is always poor in diabetics. This
will also lower blood sugar levels.
• Huckleberry helps promote insulin production. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Other
helpful herbs include black walnut, echinacea, burdock, buchu, dandelion root, and uva
ursi.
• In case of a hyperglycemia attack, go to an emergency room. You must be given fluids,
electrolytes, and possibly insulin.
• In case hypoglycemia occurs, in an emergency, immediately drink fruit juice, soft drinks,
or anything else that contains sugar. If you are insulin dependent, carry a glucagon kit
with you at all times.
• If your child has diabetes, tell his teacher the warning signs of hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia.
• Take good care of your feet, for they can become more easily infected than those of non-
diabetics.

CONTRAINDICATIONS—If emaciated, avoid exercise and prolonged hot or cold baths.
GENERAL METHOD—The general plan of treatment in this disease is essentially the same as that
required in the treatment of obesity, which this disease closely resembles; but, in cases of diabetes
accompanied by emaciation, very cold procedures, especially cold immersions (used in cases of obesity
or in cases of diabetes in which he is fleshy) must be carefully avoided, and the principal reliance must
be placed upon short cold procedures which build up his resistance while increasing oxidation of carbon
to a moderate degree. Special attention must be given to improving the intestinal digestion.

Section 11
Endocrine
Part 3
Thyroid

SYMPTOMS—The symptoms are first seen in very small children. Large amounts of thick mucous
develops in the lungs, blocking lung passages and causing difficult breathing, chronic coughing and
wheezing, and lung infections.
There are digestive problems, inadequate absorption of fats, after-meal stomach pain, and thinness. Body
sweat will have very large amounts of sodium, potassium, and chloride salts. Any, or all, of these
symptoms may occur.
CAUSES—In 1938, this physical problem was named ""cystic fibrosis"" because it was mistakenly
thought that abnormal changes in the pancreas were true cysts (tiny pockets of fluid lined with normal
tissue). But it was later discovered that those spots were just part of the shrinking process of the
pancreas, as the disease worsened.
There are three views of the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF):
1 - CF is an inherited disease, which the sufferer must learn to live with.
2 - CF is caused by inadequate absorption of selenium, zinc, essential fatty acids, and other minerals
(including trace minerals) as a result of subclinical celiac disease. (Celiac disease is the inability to
digest wheat and some other foods.)
3 - Dr. Joel Wallach, a veterinarian, who in 1978 was the first to diagnose CF in a laboratory animal, by
noting characteristic CF changes in the pancreas and liver of baby monkeys, says he was fired when it
was discovered that he could reproduce those CF changes in the body by giving or withholding the
element, selenium. He had shown that CF was a nutritional problem which could be solved if caught
early enough. (See Let's Play Doctor, J.D. Wallach, D.V.M., N.D., pp. 109-110. See order sheet.)
""The prevention of CF has been accomplished in pet, farm and laboratory animals by the veterinary
profession by assuring adequate levels of selenium and essential fatty acid nutrition to the pregnant and
nursing mother. This is not as easy as it sounds because of malabsorption problems (i.e., celiac disease
and Crohn's disease) in a percentage of women. All things being normal, a supplementation of 200 mcg
selenium per day and 5 gm of flaxseed oil, three times a day [to the pregnant and nursing mother], would
be adequate to prevent CF.
""Treatment of CF is very basic: treat the infant as early as possible with selenium IM [given
intramuscularly] at 10-25 mcg per day.""—Op cit., p. 109.
He adds that it is vital that it be determined if the infant is allergic to wheat, cow's milk or soy milk, so
as to avoid what he is allergic to.
We might conclude that all three theories are correct; in that, if you give the mother and infant proper
supplementation, the disease can be eliminated at the beginning of the child's life.
But if this is not done, he will thereafter not be able to absorb nutrients properly, will exhibit the
symptoms of CF, and will have to cope with the problem the rest of his life.
However, Wallach says that, even later, the person can lead a more normal life if he regularly receives
essential fatty acids, intravenously, and selenium, intramuscularly.
""The lungs of CF patients are normal at birth and only develop bronchiectasis after chronic essential
fatty acid and copper deficiencies have taken their toll.""—Ibid.
""CF . . is preventable, 100% curable in the early stages, and can be far better managed in chronic cases
than it is currently managed by `orthodox' medicine.""—Op. cit., p. 108."
disease-general-hypothyroidism,Hypothyroidism,"TREATMENT
• You need iodine every day, at every meal. But how do you obtain it? Long use of
thyroid medication can weaken the bones or result in breast cancer.
• Among the seaweeds, Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp are the best balanced
sources of trace minerals. Most other seaweed products also contain iodine, but they are
not always as balanced in providing a wide spectrum of other trace minerals. California
kelp is not as good.
• Here is an address for Nova Scotia dulse: Harry Greene, North Head, Grand Manan, N.
B. [New Brunswick], Canada. My last boxful was $12 for 12 ounces. I let it dry, then
whiz the leaves, put them in jars, and sprinkle it on my food.
• Some nature therapists recommend coating the bottom of your feet with iodine, in order
to increase iodine absorption by your body. Others do not recommend it. You really have
no certainty as to what substances and quantities you are taking into your body.
• Another source of iodine is Lugol's solution. This, of course, should be taken in
extremely small doses. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain. Pharmacies have it, but will
not dispense it without a prescription.
• Of course, there is also iodized salt. The problem here is that aluminum is in store-
bought salt (so it will not cake), and that can lead to Alzheimer's disease (which see).
• Some turn to ""sea salt,"" but generally this is nothing more than regular salt, extracted
from the ocean rather than from salt mines. It is just regular salt!
• Some use rock salt (from salt mines), and grind it up. But this lacks the iodine.
• There is a firm in France which produces salt from the ocean which does have all the
natural trace minerals, including iodine: The U.S. address is Grain & Salt Society, P.O.
Box DD, Magalia, CA 95954 / 916-872-5800. Of the three products (Light Grey, Fine
Ground, and Flower of the Ocean), the Fine Ground seems to strike a balance between
fine grain and low price. The salt is slightly moist, but this is natural. Dry, free-flowing,
salt has always been treated with chemicals.
• I recommend that you use both Nova Scotia dulse and this French sea salt at every meal.
• For some, thyroid problems can be corrected, but for others it is something to live with,
for a lifetime, while doing that which may lessen the problem. In addition to taking added
iodine, eat a nutritious diet. The experts say to only eat in moderation the cabbage family
(broccoli, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, mustard greens), for they tend to suppress the
thyroid function. The same is said to hold true for peaches and pears.
• Chlorine, fluoride, and iodine are chemically related, and block entrance of iodine into
the thyroid. So avoid chlorinated water, fluoridated water, and toothpaste.
• A thyroid deficiency can result from lack of sunshine and free fats (margarine, butter,
mayonnaise, fried foods, cooking fats, salad oils, and peanut butter).
• Functions of the thyroid will be increased by more exercise, for it stimulates TSH
production by the pituitary. T3 increases slowly in the blood during, and after, vigorous
exercise.
• Mother's milk is a good treatment for hypothyroid babies, and it helps protect normal
babies from developing the problem until weaning.
• Vitamin A is necessary for iodine to be properly absorbed; the B vitamins work together,
to nourish the thyroid; B helps the thyroid use its iodine effectively in hormone
6
production; B helps the thyroid work properly.

• To stimulate the thyroid: Eat one serving each of oats and bananas daily, take a cool
shower each morning and night, and work 3-5 hours out-of-doors every day.
• Avoid electric blankets if you can.
• Use a salt-free, oil-free, sugar-free diet until the thyroid is under control. But, on the long
term, you need a little salt and oil.
• In cretins, who are born hypothyroid, try taking them off the thyroid medication after
three years of supplementation. Maybe their thyroid will start functioning on its own.
• A nature healer in Central America recommends the following procedures:
• To go off thyroid supplementation: Go on a fasting, cleansing program of fruit and
vegetable juices, followed by a building program of eating simple nourishing foods
(especially raw food). Do this for 2-4 weeks. Get back and neck spinal adjustments, and
take one kelp tablet daily. He says this always works.
GOITER—He also recommends this:
To eliminate goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland): Follow the above program; and then, after the 2-4
weeks, do one or more of the following four neck applications: (1) Put an Epsom salt compress on the
neck every night, and leave it on all night for 10 nights. (2) Use a compress of white oak bark tea over
the goiter for better results. (3) Put two hot fomentations around the neck, for 4 minutes each and one
cold compress for 4 minutes. Continue alternating this for an hour. Then spend 5-10 minutes doing
exercises with the neck in various positions. (4) Put a poultice of ground-up almonds completely around
the neck and leave it on all night, for 3-10 nights. This is especially good for harder, more fibrous,
goiters.
Nitrates are goitrogenic; that is, they stimulate goiter formation. Nitrates can be found in hot dogs,
sausages, luncheon meats, and variously prepared meat products. Nitrates are also found in well water,
from fertilizer runoff.
Interestingly enough, many people with Parkinson's disease (which see) tend to have hypothyroidism.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The secret of happiness is to live a life wholly dedicated to God. You are the
Lord's, for He created you. Give Him your heart and your plans, obey His Written Word, and He will
wonderfully guide your life.

(Underactive Thyroid; Goiter)
SYMPTOMS—Fatigue and inability to tolerate cold are the most common symptoms.
Others include: loss of appetite, a slow heart rate, muscle weakness and possible cramps, dry and scaly
skin, recurrent infections, water retention (edema) and overweight, brittle nails, constipation, depression,
difficulty in concentrating, a yellow-orange coloration of the skin (especially on the palms of the hands).
In women, there might be painful menstruation, a milky breast discharge, and fertility problems.
CAUSES—The thyroid gland is the body's thermostat. It tells the rest of the body when to produce more
heat or less. Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck),
and affects several body functions, including the general rate of metabolism. The pituitary, located in the
center of the skull, sends out TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), to tell the thyroid to speed up or slow
down. When a weak thyroid does not respond, TSH levels remain high—and you have hypothyroidism.
The hormone, thyroxine, is almost pure iodine.
First thing in the morning, place a thermometer under your arm for 15 minutes while keeping still. A
temperature of 97.6o F. or lower may indicate an underactive thyroid. Write down the result for five
days. (Others say that if the test is consistently below 98, you are low thyroid.)
A low thyroid condition generally does not produce goiter (which see). If you had goiter, your thyroid
gland would enlarge.
It is thought that Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. This occurs
when the body becomes allergic to its own thyroxine! It is not clear why this happens.
In addition, the immune system can produce antibodies that invade and attack the thyroid, disrupting
hormone production. This destruction of the thyroid, resulting in hypothyroidism, is called myxedema. It
is actually a disease of the immune system. It is believed that an excess of chemicals, poisonous fumes,
medicinal drugs, tobacco smoke, impure living, etc., disrupts the immune system and starts it on such
rampages.
Get away from the chemicals by moving to the country, live a clean life, eat right, use a distiller to make
your own water, work out-of-doors part of the time, have peace with God, and you will feel better every
day.
Medical treatment includes the taking of thyroxine from animals, or synthroid. This is generally 3-9
grains each morning. An excess will cause increase in heart rate and shaking of the extended arm.
The active ingredient in synthroid and other synthetic thyroid medications, is levothyroxine. It can cause
a loss of as much as 13 percent of bone mass. An estimated 19 million people in the U.S. take this drug
for thyroid problems or thyroid cancer.
Thyroid supplementation can cause cardiac arrest in those whose hearts are not strong enough for the
increased activity the thyroid dosage places upon it.
Thyroid medication can have a similar effect on the adrenals. They may be working poorly, as a result of
years of low thyroxine. The medication can cause adrenal insufficiency. Diabetes can be made worse by
the thyroid pill. Anticoagulants can be upset.
In newborn infants, synostosis can occur if they are given thyroid. The skull bones close prematurely
and the brain does not develop properly.
Thyroid supplementation also increases the need for insulin and, in some, for antidepressants as they
become extremely agitated.
Thyroid medication can produce arrhythmia, angina, and tachycardia, or hair loss.
After menopause, a smaller dose of thyroid medication is often needed by women.
The human body needs less thyroid as it gets older, so older folk should try reducing their dose of
synthroid. To do this, try reducing the amount you take by one dose a week (example: 5 doses a week,
then 4 doses the next week, etc.). When you encounter problems, stay with that amount for 4 weeks to
see if the thyroid will adjust itself to this new amount. After a month, try reducing the dosage again, but
staying one month at each reduced level."
disease-general-hyperthyroidism,Hyperthyroidism,"TREATMENT
• The eating of kelp helps every type of thyroid problem, including hyperthyroidism. Kelp
is a rich source of iodine and thyroxine. The hormone produced by the thyroid is almost
pure iodine.
• Genuine sea salt is another worthwhile source of iodine (see Hypothyroidism).
• Deficiencies of vitamins C and E can result in overproduction of the thyroid hormone.
• Eat lots of the cabbage family of foods (broccoli, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts,
mustard greens), for they tend to suppress the thyroid function. The same is said to hold
true for peaches and pears.
• Cut down on dairy products and avoid nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, soft drinks, and
processed and junk food.
• The pituitary, parathyroids, and sexual functions work closely together, and they are
affected by the thyroid. Problems in one area can affect them all.
• Radioactive sodium iodine (iodine 131, also called I-131) may be recommended, but
know that it can cause severe side effects.
• Do not be quick to try surgery on your thyroid. You have enough problems without
doing that.

Lymphatic
Lymph System

(Overactive Thyroid)
SYMPTOMS—Fatigue; insomnia; intolerance; irritability; increased perspiration; constantly feeling
hot; frequent bowel movements; hair and weight loss; nails separate from nail bed; change in skin
thickness; hand tremors; intolerance of heat; rapid heartbeat; goiter; and, sometimes, protruding
eyeballs. In women, there may also be less frequent menstruation and decreased flow.
CAUSES—Hypothyroidism is caused by an underactive thyroid, and results in a slow metabolism and
all it brings with it. Hyperthyroidism is the opposite: The thyroid is overactive; metabolism is too fast,
and that brings its own problems. The thyroid gland is producing too much thyroxine.
Sometimes called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is not a simple problem to deal with. Graves' disease
is the most common form of it, which 2.5 million Americans have.
A detailed discussion of the thyroid is found in our article on Hypothyroidism (which see), which is far
more common. Both affect women more often than men. When the thyroid does not work properly, a
variety of different physical problems can develop.
In fact, the word, ""hypochondriac,"" was coined many years ago, to describe these strange people who
have all kinds of things wrong with them, when they do not seem to have anything wrong with them.
Surely, it must all be in their heads! Well, it was in their throats. We now know those people had under
or overactive thyroids.
Infection of the thyroid or certain prescription drugs can temporarily produce hyperthyroidism."
disease-general-swollen-glands,Swollen Glands,"TREATMENT
• The specific infection needs to be overcome through fasting, bed rest, careful diet,
keeping the bowels open, and not consuming improper foods or drink.
• Vitamins A, B complex, and C are important.
—See ""Fevers."" Also see other topics in this section on the Lymphatics.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Precious are the privileges of the soul who abides in Christ. Whatever the
trials that life may bring, in Christ's strength, we are able to meet them.

SYMPTOMS—This generally refers to the swelling of lymph nodes (commonly referred to as
""glands"") on the sides of the neck, by the throat.
But it can also refer to enlargement of any other lymph glands, such as are under the armpits or in the
groin.
There may also be heat, tenderness, and reddening of the overlying skin, as well as fever.
CAUSES—The lymph system filters out infections of various types, in order to rid them from the
system. But an infection in the lymph nodes can occur. This can be a localized infection or an infection
symptomatic of a more serious condition, such as measles, chicken pox, mononucleosis, tuberculosis,
syphilis, leukemia, or cancer."
disease-general-lymphangitis,Lymphangitis,"(Spleenic Inflammation)
SYMPTOMS—Begins with a chill and high fever, with moderate swelling and pain of the lymphatic
tissues. A severe pain develops in the left side, and extends up to the shoulder. When the infection is in
the deep layers of skin, there is a deep general flush with raised borders in the affected areas. The skin
becomes hot and dry, and the person becomes very thirsty.
CAUSE AND TREATMENT—This is a streptococcus infection of one or more lymphatic glands,
usually of the spleen. Applications of heat should be made, in the form of baths or hot fomentations.
Give plenty of fluids, to help flush out the lymphatics.
Rest and a light diet are important. Give a fruit diet for a few days. Give the kind of care for one with a
fever. Keep the bowels open, using laxative herbs. Do not strain at the stool, for this could injure a
temporarily enlarged spleen.
Apply hot fomentations, followed by short cold. This will greatly help to reduce pain and inflammation.
Do this 2-3 times a day until the pain is relieved, then once a day.
—See ""Fevers.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We must be living branches, connected closely to Christ, so that we may bear
the fruit of unselfish kindness to all about us. By His grace this can be done."
disease-general-hodgkin-s-disease,Hodgkin'S Disease,"TREATMENT
• Contact your physician.
• Go on a vegetable juice fast for 2-3 days, then eat nourishing food, and fast again every
few days. It is vital that you clean out the system, so it can restore itself.
• Stop eating all refined, and junk, food. Stop smoking and drinking liquor. You must live
right if you are to recover.
• Steam baths, salt glows, and hot and cold water treatments will invigorate the body.
• Keep the bowels open. Do not strain at the stool, for this could injure a temporarily
enlarged spleen.
• Helpful herbs include echinacea, burdock, pau d'arco, and red clover. Other herbs
include white oak bark, plantain, vervain, and yarrow.
—For further information, see ""Cancer.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Decide, with all your heart, that you will walk in the truth found in the Bible,
and you will be safe. Cling to Jesus as your only help and stay close to Him amid the crises of life.

(Hodgkin's Lymphoma)
SYMPTOMS—Fatigue, itching, fever, general sickish feeling, night sweats, weakness, weight loss,
enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen which is generally not painful.
CAUSES—Hodgkin's disease is cancer of the lymph glands, which includes the lymph nodes and the
spleen. It most frequently occurs in young adults. There are hundreds of lymph nodes in your body and,
together with their connecting network of tubes, are really immense in size and scope.
The lymphatic system helps protect the body against toxins of various types. Carried off through the
lymphatic vessels, those foreign substances are then temporarily stored in lymphatic organs (the spleen,
nodes, tonsils, and appendix). If these are removed, or become clogged because too much waste matter
is being channeled through them, then trouble occurs."
disease-general-mononucleosis,Mononucleosis,"TREATMENT
• Go on a light fast of fruit and vegetable juices for a day or two.
• Eat a nourishing diet, emphasizing vegetable soups, potato peeling broth, and brown
rice. Eat small meals.
• Drink plenty of distilled water.
• Do not eat processed, or junk, food. Do not eat meat, sugar, fried foods, or drink soft
drinks.
• Stay in bed until the worst part is over. You need lots of rest.
• Do not strain at the stool, for this could injure a temporarily enlarged spleen.
• Be alert to signs that a more serious spleenic infection may be about to begin: a fever
over 102o F, severe pain in the middle of your left side that last 5 minutes or more,
breathing becomes difficult, or swallowing becomes difficult. If this happens, contact your
physician. See ""Lymphangitis.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus is your Counselor. It is your privilege to cast all your care upon Him, for
He careth for you.
SCROFULA—1
(Lymph TB)
HYDRO—Scrofula is a type of tuberculosis which affects the lymphatic organs. The following
suggestions are from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
Graduated cold applications; sunbaths; cold air baths; out-of-door exercises and living; aseptic diet, rich
in protein; live in an elevated region—and not in the damp lowlands.
—Also see ""Scrofula—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—As the heart is opened to the entrance of God's Written Word, light from
heaven shines upon the soul. Determine to make God first, best, and last in everything you say and do.
SCROFULA—2

INCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE—Graduated cold applications; sunbaths; cold air
baths; out-of-door exercises and living; aseptic diet, rich in protein; live in an elevated region (not in the
damp lowlands).
GENERAL—Revulsive or Alternate Compress over swollen glands, twice a day. During intervals
between, apply flannel-covered Heating Compress, renewed before it becomes dry.

Reproductive
Part 1
Breast

(Mono)
SYMPTOMS—Depression, fatigue, fever, generalized aching, sore throat, swollen glands, headache,
jaundice, with possible red rash in the form of raised bumps.
CAUSES—Mono is a contagious disease, primarily affecting the spleen and lymphatic system.
It can be transmitted by kissing, sexual contact, or sharing food or utensils. But it can also be spread
through the air, breathing contaminated air exhaled by another. So it is not necessarily the ""kissing
disease"" it is described to be.
Most frequently contracted by children and teenagers, the incubation period is 10 days among children
and 30-50 days among adults.
The symptoms are very similar to those of the flu, but those of mononucleosis continue for 2-4 weeks!
Even after the other symptoms are gone, a general fatigue can continue for 3-8 weeks more. Some
people continue to feel fatigued for months or years.
Individuals frequently say they felt sick but continued working, thinking they would shake it off—and
then came down with mono. So if you feel like going to bed and getting well, do it before something
worse happens to you.
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or, more rarely, the cytomegalovirus (CMV), is the cause of this
infection. Therefore it cannot be treated with antibiotics. Both EBV and CMV remain in the body
throughout the rest of one's life; but the infection, carefully treated, generally seems to go away.
Therefore, rest and care for yourself, so the outward symptoms will successfully go away!"
disease-general-menopause,Menopause,"(Climacteric, Change of Life)
SYMPTOMS—Hot flashes, insomnia, disturbances in calcium metabolism, irritability, mental
instability, dizziness, backaches, headaches, bladder problems, dryness and aging of the skin, shortness
of breath, and heart palpitations. Some have almost no symptoms at all.
CAUSES—Menopause is the cessation of ovarian function, the stopping of the menstrual cycle, and the
end of reproductive years. This is caused by glandular changes, and is a natural event in a woman's life;
this usually occurs between 42 and 55. The average age is about 50, and the transition is generally up to
5 years.
There tends to be a hormone starvation at that time, since menopause usually results from a decreased
production of the female sex hormones.
The lessened supply of estrogen increases the possibility of cardiovascular disease, vaginal atrophy, and
osteoporosis.
It is popular to take estrogen supplements, to prevent or postpone menopausal symptoms. But keep in
mind that there is an increased risk of cancer when this is done.
If estrogen (hormone replacement) therapy is begun, take vitamin E several hours earlier or later, not at
the same time.
In addition, generous amounts of vitamins B , C, folic acid, pantothenic acid, PABA, and B will make
6 12
the estrogen therapy more effective.
Oral estrogens should not be accompanied by progesterone because they increase the cancer induction
risk.
Keep in mind that synthetic, not natural, estrogens are given in hormone replacement therapy. These
tend to accumulate in the body, and also can cause metabolic changes in the liver. This can lead to high
blood pressure, fluid retention, and blood clots. But natural estrogens are available; one is equine
estrogen, and is extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. But it is very powerful, and may also cause
changes in the liver. Do not use it if you are obese, smoke, or have high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
or varicose veins.
The safest natural estrogens are estropipate (Ogen) and estradiol (Estrace, Emcyt, and Estraderm); these
are all metabolized more easily by your body. Be sure and use the smallest possible dose, and take it
only every other day.
It is coming to be recognized that it is often more important to replace the lessened progesterone than the
lessened estrogen. Natural progesterone creams (from the herb, wild yam) provide a simplified way to
do this. Many, many, have been helped by doing this!
When the menopause proceeds normally, the adrenals and liver increase their output of female hormones
and make up the difference from the lost ovarian function.
Proper diet, nutritional supplements, exercise, and adequate rest can minimize the effects of menopause.
TREATMENT—Vitamin E (up to 1,200 IU daily) is especially important at this time.
• Vitamin C, working with bioflavonoids, maintains capillary strength.
• The B complex vitamins, especially pantothenic acid and PABA, relieve nervous
irritability.
• It is very important that sufficient calcium be taken, to maintain a proper calcium-
phosphorous balance. Not doing so can also result in a broken hip later.
• An increase in protein and reduction in carbohydrates is recommended at this time.
• Maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D, iron, and magnesium.
• Eliminate all processed, refined, and junk foods. This includes white sugar and white-
flour products.
• Raw fruit and vegetable juices, brewer's yeast, lecithin, kelp, and cold-pressed vegetable
oils are needed. The diet should be at least 50% raw food.
• Avoid animal products and dairy products.
• Do not use alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, sugar, and hot soups and drinks. They make
the emotional swings worse and the blood more acidic. This causes the bones to release
extra calcium, to balance blood pH and weaken the bones if extra calcium is not taken.
• Substitute garlic and onion powder for salt. Consuming salt increases urinary excretion
of calcium.
• Drink 2 quarts of water each day, to help prevent drying of skin and mucous membranes.
• After menopause begins, you will not have as much calcium in your body, due to the
lessened estrogen; it is important that you henceforth supplement with calcium. Of the
250,000 hip fractures that occur in the U.S. every year, 80% are due to osteoporosis.
• Avoid mental and emotional stress and worry. Be happy with the blessings you have,
and thank God for them.
• Get plenty of outdoor exercise and sufficient rest. Lay down and rest a little before lunch
and supper. A lack of exercise weakens bone density.
• Especially important are vitamins E, C, A, and B complex, including PABA and
pantothenic acid.
• Hypothyroidism is common during menopause, and is responsible for a number of the
symptoms. Be sure and take additional amounts of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp.
• Helpful herbs include lady's mangle, motherwort, and St. John's wort.
—Also see ""Menstrual Disorders"" for related information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All the instructions we need to obey God is found in the Bible. Read it every
day; and, accompanied by earnest prayer for help, you will receive the strength needed to fulfill God's
will one day at a time.
# DOUCHE
HOW TO DO IT—A douche is especially helpful if one has a history of discharges or infection.
Retention douches are especially effective, and are best done in a bathtub with the feet up on the sides,
to aid in retaining the fluid for 10-15 minutes. Warm the douche to body temperature before taking.
Possible douches include:
4-8 ounces of diluted vinegar to a pint of distilled water, 4-8 ounces of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 ounce
of bayberry myrtle (myrica cerifera) to 1 pint water.
A replant of lactobacillus acidophilus may be needed, to normalize flora after vaginitis or antibiotic drug
medications. Plain, unsweetened yogurt (4 ounces) can be emptied into warm water (10-20 oz.).
Routine douching is not necessary for personal hygiene. Douching is best reserved for therapy, in time
of infection. Excessive douching may actually help promote infection.
WARNING—Douching may induce pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In one study, almost 90% of
the women with PID were vigorous douchers, often since the age of 16 or 17. Very likely, infected fluid
is flushed up into the uterine cavity by the douche.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Home is to be the center of the purest and most elevated affection. As, through
prayer and earnest effort, each person in the home is submitted to be molded by the Spirit of God, home
can become a little heaven.

• Go on a fruit and vegetable juice fast for a time.
• When solid food is started, eat nourishing food, free of sugar and oil. Avoid junk food.
Do not use tobacco, caffeine, or alcohol.
• For pain relief, apply heat to the lower back or abdomen. Sitz baths are also helpful.
• A hot half bath is useful in fighting the infection.
• Every 4 hours, take a hot footbath while ice bags are on the lower abdomen for 30
minutes, followed by 30 minutes rest in bed. This will speed the healing process.
ENCOURAGEMENT—A great name among men is as letters traced in sand, but a spotless character

METRITIS, CHRONIC
(Inflammation of Uterus) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,
Formulas)
BASIC APPLICATIONS—Graduated cold applications; hot vaginal irrigation, 10-15 minutes, twice
daily; Hot Blanket Pack to legs with cold pelvic pack (Wet Sheet Pack over pelvic area), continued to
sweating stage, followed by cold friction or Wet Sheet Rub.
PAIN—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath at 950-970 F., for 15-20 minutes.
LEUKORRHEA—In addition to the above measures, antiseptic vaginal irrigation. In certain cases,
cool irrigation, at 750-650 F., produces better results than hot irrigation. Constipation and portal
congestion must be relieved. Cervical catarrh and erosions often require the use of the curette (a spoon-
shaped scraping instrument for removing foreign matter from a cavity).
ACUTE INFLAMMATION—If attacks of inflammation occur, rest in bed. Hot Hip or Leg Pack. Hot
and cold pelvic compress or hot and cold pelvic pack.

SYMPTOMS—Lack of appetite, nausea, fever, chills, generalized aching, fast heartbeat, and
occasionally vaginal bleeding. There is acute aching of both sides of the abdomen. Bowel movements
may intensify the pain.
CAUSES—Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the female pelvic organs, and occurs most
often among sexually active women between the ages of 15 and 25.
Although abortions can result in sterility, pelvic inflammatory disease causes them even more
frequently. A single attack of this disease produces sterility about 15% of the time.
It is believed that this disorder owes its origin to unsanitary conditions, especially during intercourse.
The use of intrauterine devices is another cause. The disorder was over four times higher in IUD users.
They may not have been sterile or may have been inserted by hands that had not been carefully washed.
Douching is yet a third cause of this problem. It appears that they may not have been done carefully
enough, and bacteria was flushed up into the uterus. In one study, 90% of the infected women regularly
douched, and frequently had done so since the ages of 16 or 17."
disease-general-vaginitis,Vaginitis,"TREATMENT
• All of the above factors should be carefully noted.
• For yeast vaginitis, use a hot soda-water douche (1-3 teaspoons of soda to 1 quart water)
twice a day for 7 days, then once a day for 30 days.
• If there is not clear and rapid improvement, a trichomonas may be the cause. If so, apply
a vinegar douche (1-4 tablespoon of vinegar to 1 quart water) twice a day for 7 days, then
once a day for 30 days.
• Garlic-water douche (1 clove into part of a quart of boiling water; add the remainder of
the quart, let cool to 110o F. twice a day for 7 days, then once a day for 30 days).
• For organisms other than yeast and trichomonas, a warm normal saline douche (1
teaspoon of salt per quart water) is useful.
• Hot sitz baths, 2-3 times a day will soothe local irritation; but it is important that the tub
be sterilized first, lest bacteria be introduced into the vagina.
• An alternate method is to apply garlic suppositories. Peel a clove of garlic and wrap it in
a piece of sterile gauze. Lubricate the suppository with pure organic vegetable oil and
insert it in the vagina, yet keep a piece protruding outside. Continue doing this for 3 days,
changing suppositories every 3 hours.
• Adequate rest, a healthful diet, and meticulous personal hygiene with frequent bathing
are important.
• Take vitamins A and B complex.
• Avoid panty hose, girdles, or synthetic pants or panties. Tight-fitting clothing increases
moisture retention. Wear cotton clothing.
• Avoid chemical deodorant sprays, tampons, and colored toilet paper. Do not use
commercial sexual lubricants.
• Beware of tub baths! Take showers instead.
• Do not wash socks and stockings with underwear, lest foot infections be transferred to
the pelvic organs.
• Cotton underwear can be microwaved to destroy yeast. Wet it, wring it out well, and
microwave on high for 30 seconds.
• Do not have marital relations during menstruation or infections or, if you can avoid it, a
few days immediately afterward.
• Require that your husband wash his hands and genitals before intercourse. If he really
loves you, he will gladly do this.
• Tea tree oil is good for vaginitis. Use creams, suppositories, etc.
• Aloe vera is helpful for infections, including yeast infections. It can be taken internally
or used as a douche.
• Also helpful are bayberry, goldenseal, yarrow, marshmallow root, calendula, chamomile,
pau d'arco, and dandelion.
• To normalize vaginal flora, eat plain yogurt and/or apply it to the vagina.
• Include adequate fiber in the diet.
• Do not take iron supplements until the infection is reduced. Infectious bacteria require
iron for growth.
• Apply an opened vitamin E capsule to the area, to reduce itching.
• For atrophic vaginitis, use natural progesterone cream and apply to the vagina.
Prescription ointments for this condition contain estrogen. But they increase the need for
vitamin B . Vaginal absorption of estrogen may be dangerous.

• Do not use sweet-smelling douches. A plain yogurt douche is much better. (Also see
""Douches."")
• If you have chronic or persistent vaginitis, you may have diabetes.
• If you have recurring vaginitis, you may be getting it from your husband.
• For more information on dealing with a yeast infection, see ""Candida"" and ""Athlete's
Foot.""

ENCOURAGEMENT—By sin, earth was cut off from heaven and alienated from its communion. But
Jesus has connected it again with God's throne. His love has encircled man, and opened the way so you
can find God anew and walk with Him every day.

(Candidiasis, Yeast Vaginitis; Trichomoniasis; Atrophic
Vaginitis)
SYMPTOMS—Vaginal pain or tenderness, itching, increased vaginal discharge, burning sensation,
painful intercourse, and urination.
CAUSES—Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina. There are four types:
1 - Yeast vaginitis, also called monilial, or thrush. The yeast infection causing it is candida albicans. It is
more common in pregnant women, diabetics, and those on antibiotics, oral contraceptives, or long-term
steroid therapy. Changes in the vaginal pH (caused by tap water, tub baths, certain additives to bath
water, and some commercial douches) permit the yeast to grow in the vagina. The discharge is moderate
in amount, but thick yellowish or white and curd-like. It may cause severe itching of the external
genitalia (see ""Candida"").
2 - Trichomonas, caused by trichomonas vaginalis. This is a protozoan which likes an alkaline
environment. It may be sexually transmitted (so both should be treated at the same time). In the man,
there are no symptoms; in the woman, there is a greenish white or heavy yellow, frothy, discharge which
may have a slight odor. The discharge causes itching, burning, and reddening of the skin. If it spreads to
the urethra, there may be frequent burning urination. Flagyl, which is a medication for this, is known to
cause cancer in animals.
3 - Non-specific vaginitis is caused by organisms other than yeast or trichomonas, and occurs when
resistance is low and the normal vaginal flora changes.
4 - Atrophic vaginitis occurs in post-menopausal women and those whose ovaries have been surgically
removed. Adhesions form and there is a high susceptibility to infection. Symptoms include itching or
burning, painful intercourse, and a thin watery discharge, sometimes tinged with blood.
Vaginitis may have one or more of the following causes: bacterial or fungal infection, intestinal worms,
vitamin B deficiency, congestion of the pelvic organs, gonococci, chemical irritation (strong douches),
mechanical irritation (tampons), drug medications, and deodorant sprays.
Other contributing factors include tight and nonporous clothing, diabetes, and the use of antibiotics.
The birth control pill causes a B deficiency and changes the vaginal pH.
6
Pregnancy increases the vaginal pH, and also its glycogen content. This is favorable to yeast infection.
But it generally leaves
Tight-fitting synthetic underwear provides poor ventilation and a warm, moist, environment for yeast
infection to occur.
Excess sugar and refined carbohydrates help feed yeast infection.
Normally, the pH of the vagina is acid; anything that alkalinizes it contributes to vaginitis. Causes
include diabetes, menstrual period, pregnancy, and the time just after a miscarriage or abortion.
The most common aftereffect of antibiotic therapy in women is a vaginal yeast infection.
Frequent douching upsets vaginal pH and flora.
Excessive sex or intercourse, without proper lubrication, irritates vaginal walls.
About 5% of women given tetracycline for acne develop vaginitis.
Intrauterine devices (IUDs) produce a favorable environment for yeast infection, since they reduce
normal vaginal secretions.
Four primary factors are antibiotics, oral contraceptives, diabetes, and pregnancy."
disease-general-leukorrhea,Leukorrhea,"TREATMENT
• The infective cause should be determined, and then treated. See articles noted at the
bottom of this article.
• Wear white cotton underwear, so air can circulate freely. Keep the area clean and dry.
• To restore natural vaginal flora, douche with 6-8 acidophilus capsules or plain yogurt.
Also douche with fresh garlic juice and water.
• Helpful herbs include pau d'arco tea as a natural antibiotic. Drink 3 cups daily.
—See ""Candida,"" ""Chlamydia,"" Vaginitis,"" ""Toxic Shock,"" and ""Douches"" for much more information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Let the peace of God reign in your soul. Then you will have strength to bear
all suffering, and you will rejoice that you have grace to endure. God can give you help that no one else
can.

SYMPTOMS—A thick whitish vaginal discharge. Related symptoms may include burning and itching
of the vulva.
CAUSES—Leukorrhea is nonspecific vaginal discharge that contains mucous and white blood cells;
sometimes it is tinged with blood. The amount of discharge increases when estrogen levels are
heightened. If blood is present, a more serious disorder may be indicated.
It is often a symptom of vaginal infection. Infective causes include candida (candida albicans, also called
yeast infection or monilia), trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia, hemophilus vaginitis, streptococcus, or
neisseria gonorrhea. It can also be caused by staphylococcus; this is the bacteria which will cause toxic
shock syndrome when vaginal tampons are used incorrectly. Culture growth of bacteria and examination
of discharge under microscope is needed for specific diagnosis.
Other causes include a vitamin B complex deficiency, excessive douching, the use of antibiotics or oral
contraceptives, or intestinal worms.
Leukorrhea frequently occurs where there is diabetes or pregnancy."
disease-general-toxic-shock-syndrome,Toxic Shock Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Take this person immediately to the emergency room at the hospital. Do not let them
make you wait awhile! The person needs fluids and electrolytes by IV, along with
penicillin.
—Also see ""Leukorrhea""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Praise the Lord; talk of His goodness; tell of His power. He is the health of
your countenance, your Saviour, and your God.

SYMPTOMS—Sudden onset of the condition: diarrhea, vomiting, headache, confusion, skin rash, and
sore throat. There can be rapid deterioration and even death, within 48 hours.
CAUSES—Prevention is far better than treatment. Aside from the name, this is an actual disease.
Circumstances has permitted staphylococcus in the system, to produce exotoxins faster than the body
defenses can eliminate them.
Young women between 13-32 years of age contract 85% of this disease. In their case, the cause is
usually the improper use of vaginal tampons. A single one is kept in place more than 4 hours. This
produces an ideal environment for rapid staphylococcus growth with terrible consequences.
A less frequent cause is food poisoning (which see), caused by poor food handling."
disease-general-hysterectomy,Hysterectomy,"TREATMENT
• If you have had a hysterectomy, eat a nutritious diet, with vitamin/mineral
supplementation. This will reduce the amount of estrogen deprivation, especially if you
still have your ovaries.
• If you do use hormonal replacement, take the lowest dosage possible. Ask for a
combined hormone containing both estrogen and progesterone. That will help reduce the
risk of cancer. Progesterone, not estrogen, is the hormone most needed in replacement
therapy.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Keep your thoughts on Christ and the heavenly world, and you will have more
strength for the trials of life. Talk His praise and rest in His love.
Section 13
Reproductive
Part 4
Male Pelvic Organs
SPERMATORRHEA—1
(Nocturnal Emission)
SYMPTOMS—Involuntary loss of semen, without orgasm, often while asleep.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—The male generative organs, the testes, must remain somewhat cooler
than body temperature. When they become overheated (by taking a hot tub bath), a release of sperm will
be made in the night, since that supply of sperm has become damaged.
If you sleep too warm at night, due to an electric sleeping blanket set on high, the overheated testicles
will eject sperm the next day.
Another cause is visual or thought sexual stimulation. A poor diet is another cause.
A low-protein diet, free from the use of eggs may also prove of benefit.
—Also see ""Spermatorrhea—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Pray with unshaken faith and trust. The Angel of the covenant, even our Lord
Jesus Christ, is the Mediator who secures the acceptance of the prayers of His believing ones. God can
give you the help you need.
SPERMATORRHEA—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC—Graduated cold applications, to improve general conditions.
GENERAL NERVOUS IRRITABILITY—Prolonged Neutral Bath at night.
IRRITABLE PROSTATE, IRRITABLE URETHRA—Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath, 30-60 minutes,
at bedtime; Revulsive Douche to perineum with little pressure; tepid Colonic at 800 F.
RELAXED EJACULATORY DUCTS—Rubbing Cold Sitz Bath; cold or alternate hot and cold
Colonic; Cold Douche to feet and legs; Cold percussion Douche to lower spine. Bowels must be kept
regular by the Cool Enema, if necessary, and proper diet. An aseptic dietary is essential. Condiments
must be strictly avoided.
CAUTION—When losses are frequent or parts irritable, avoid Cold Sitz Baths and prolonged Hot
Baths.
—Also see ""Spermatorrhea—1.""

SYMPTOMS—Depression, urinary tract problems, joint pain, headaches, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue,
loss of bone mass, and increased likelihood of heart disease.
CAUSES—A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, and is done to remove fibroids (30%
of the time), endometriosis (20%), or uterine prolapse (18%).
There are three types of hysterectomies, each more complete than the preceding one:
1 - Partial hysterectomy: The uterus is removed, but the cervix and other female reproductive organs
remain.
2 - Total hysterectomy: Both the uterus and cervix are removed.
3 - Panhysterectomy: The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are removed.
There are problems which led to the decision to have a hysterectomy. These may include urinary tract
problems, lengthy and heavy periods, a heavy and bloated feeling, abdominal swelling due to fibroids,
infertility resulting from fibroids or endometriosis, or reactions to drugs given for endometriosis.
But the problems resulting from a hysterectomy are, if anything, more significant:
The hormones are suddenly stopped. This sends shock waves throughout the entire system.
Lack of those hormones can result in immense bone mass loss, osteoporosis, and greater likelihood of
heart disease, depression, urinary tract problems, dizziness, insomnia, headaches, and general fatigue.
Even those women who do not have their ovaries cut out still experience a drastic lessening of estrogen
output. In addition, menopause begins years earlier for half the women who are spared their ovaries.
Depression may also occur, and reduced sexual desire frequently does. There is a 50% chance of a minor
post-operative complication, such as fever, bleeding, or wound healing. One in a 1,000 die and 10%
require a blood transfusion.
It has been estimated that many of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in America each year are
totally unnecessary. No foreign country has even half that per capita amount.
Once the operation has been performed, you are permanently sterile, and it cannot be reversed.
It is often recommended that the ovaries be taken out also, because they might later become cancerous.
Yet statistics reveal that ovarian cancer is rare.
It is frequently recommended that a hysterectomy be performed, to eliminate fibroids, since they might
be malignant. But modern technology permits them to be examined, by ultrasound, for abnormalities. A
myomectomy should be performed to remove problematic fibroids, not a hysterectomy. (Also see
""Fibroids."")
Women who have hysterectomies have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.
If you decide to have a hysterectomy, ask that a horizontal incision be made, not a vertical one. The scar
will thus be less noticeable afterward."
disease-general-frigidity,Frigidity,"TREATMENT
• Eat eggs fresh from the hen (not those in the stores which have been stored cold), alfalfa,
olive oil, pumpkin seeds and other seeds, nuts, soy oil, avocados, and wheat.
• Avoid meat products.
• Vitamin deficiencies can result in lowered estrogen levels and thus poor lubrication.
Obtain vitamins B complex and E.
• Helpful herbs include wild yam. This contains a natural steroid which may help. Take it
for 2 weeks, stop for 2 weeks, and then back on again.
• Damiana contains alkaloids which, like testosterone, directly stimulates nerves. Place a
eyedropperful under your tongue an hour or two before coming together. It may require
several days before a desired effect will be noted.
• Extra lubrication may help reduce possible pain.
• Also helpful are gotu kola, Siberian ginseng, saw palmetto, and sarsaparilla.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Songs of praise to God will help you keep up your courage. Trust Him and
know that He is the best Friend you can ever have. In His strength you can have the help you need. He
will do for you that which is best.

SYMPTOMS—Absence of sexual desire, or an inability to find pleasure, in sexual intercourse.
CAUSES—Frigidity is generally of psychic, not organic, cause. There is guilt, fear, depression, a sense
of inferiority or conflict with one's mate. Unfortunate experience and misinformation, received earlier in
life, often lays the groundwork for the problem.
However, in some cases the woman may find intercourse painful because of inadequate stimulation,
insufficient lubrication, or underlying infection or disease."
disease-general-female-stress-syndrome,Female Stress Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Fresh fruit and vegetable juice, lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains.
Flaxseed oil and lecithin are also important.
• Adequate vitamin and mineral supplementation, especially vitamins B complex, A, C, E,
selenium, zinc, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not forget the One who gives you all blessings. God alone can provide for
your needs. Trust in Him. He can give you the peace of heart you so much need.
FEMALE INFERTILITY—1
(Female Fertility Problems)
SYMPTOMS—Seeming inability of a woman to become pregnant.
CAUSES—Infertility is generally defined as the failure to conceive after a year or more of regular
sexual activity during the time of ovulation. Either the woman or the man may be the cause (see
""Impotence, Male""). Infertility usually means that the problem can be reversed; sterility means that the
situation is permanent. An estimated 20% of American couples experience infertility. Determining the
exact cause can be difficult.
In general, 60% of couples conceive within 6 months, and 90% within a year. If you both are under 28,
and have no reason to think otherwise, you ought to have a baby within a year.
A frequent cause is a deficiency in one or more nutrients.
The problem may be that the woman is not cycling and ovulating properly. If she has less than 20%
body fat, she may not.
Other causes include inherited disorders, infections, venereal disease, mishandled abortions,
endometriosis, bacterial organisms, drugs, plugged fallopian tubes, emotional trauma, or frigidity (which
see).
If you are producing milk or have male-pattern hair growth on your breasts, upper lip, or chin, you may
have a hormonal imbalance.
You or your spouse may have had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease which can destroy the
fallopian tubes in women and inflame and scar the ductile system in men. Over 4,000 Americans
contract this disease yearly.
You may have had pelvic infections, endometriosis, polycystic ovary disease, abdominal or urinary tract
surgery, injuries to the perineum, excessively high fevers, the mumps or measles. You may have used an
intrauterine device (IUD).
One of you may have been exposed to a harmful chemical, such as lead.
Kidney problems can result in reproductive imbalances. Clean out the kidneys.
In rare instances, women develop antibodies to their partner's sperm.
In some cases, one or the other is only half-hearted about having a baby.
• Eat a nourishing diet; be sure to supplement it with sufficient vitamins and minerals and,
if necessary, digestive aids. A high-protein diet, essential fatty acids, vitamins A, B
complex, zinc, germanium, and CoQ10.
• A deficiency of selenium can lead to infertility in women.
• Vitamin E is very important if you wish to conceive.
• Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a B vitamin which stimulates the pituitary gland and
sometimes restores fertility to a woman.
• Test for food allergies (see ""Pulse Test"").
• Avoid white flour, fried, sugar, junk, and caffeine foods. Do not eat animal fats.
• A gluten-free diet has enabled women, who previously were unable to conceive, to
become pregnant.
• Stop smoking and do not be around cigarette smoke.
• Avoid caffeine and medicinal drugs. Caffeine can prevent pregnancy from beginning.
• There is the possibility that you have had heavy metal poisoning.
• Women who drink alcohol can prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in their womb.
• Helpful herbs include black cohosh, red clover, yellow dock, wild yam, chamomile,
skullcap, dong quai.
• Black cohosh balances hormones, False unicorn, wild yam, and dong quai help increase
fertility.
• The use of natural progesterone cream has helped many women become pregnant. An
excellent alternative is wild yam, which contains progesterone. Rub it on the abdomen.
• Avoid stress.
• The closer a woman's weight is to the ideal, the more likely she is to conceive.
• Do not exercise too much at that time. It can, in some, cause a skipped ovulation or
increase infertility.
• Avoid hot tubs and saunas, for they may cause changes in ovulation.
• Do not douche. It can interfere with vaginal pH. Beware of commercial douches,
lubrication agents, and jellies.
• Use egg whites instead of petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly might kill the sperm; the egg
whites may help them in their journey. Only use egg whites during the few days each
month when the woman is fertile. Egg whites are pure protein; a study, in Canada, found
that it was the best lubricant to use if conception was desired. Take the egg out of the
refrigerator earlier, so it will not be cold, and separate the yolk form the white.
• Do not work so hard that you are fatigued. It is well-known that people who go on a
vacation trip are more likely to conceive. They have more time to relax and rest up.
• Make sure you time it just right.
• The woman should remain lying down for 20 minutes after ejaculation.
• If a woman has developed antibodies to her husband's sperm, avoid releasing sperm for a
month (via a condom, etc.). This should cause the sperm antibodies to decrease.
• There is always risk if you give consent for a physician to do fertility testing inside your
body.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Pray earnestly for help, and God will give you the very blessing that is best for
you. Whatever path God chooses is the very best for us.
FEMALE INFERTILITY—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL CARE—When not due to organic disease, this may be eliminated by a course of water
treatments. A series of graduated cold applications (Tonic Frictions) is most useful. The Cold Rubbing
Sitz is highly useful. Remove catarrhal conditions of uterus and vagina and subinvolution by means of
hot vaginal irrigation, followed by tonic (cool or cold) Sitz.
MALE IMPOTENCE—1
(Male Fertility Problems)
SYMPTOMS—Inability of a man to produce viable sperm which will unite with an ovum and result in
conception.
CAUSES—There are more than 20 million sperm in a teaspoon. The most frequent cause of male
infertility is low sperm count or an anatomical abnormality. Sperm factors account for 40% of all cases
of infertility.
Factors affecting this include excessive heat to the testes, exposure to toxins or radiation alcohol
consumption, endocrine disorders, recent acute illness, or prolonged fever. Any viral illness associated
with a fever up to 3 months earlier. Testicular mumps is another cause.
A very common structural damage problem in men is a varicocele. This is a dilated vein of the spermatic
duct.
If your sperm count is healthy, a cold or flue probably will affect it. But if sperm count is borderline, an
illness might render you infertile for a time.
• Obtain an adequate diet, including enough protein, essential fatty acids, and, if
necessary, digestive aids.
• Pay special attention to selenium deficiency as a factor in male infertility.
• Strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet has enabled some men, who previously thought
they were sterile, to become fathers.
• Do not use anabolic steroids! They can shut down the pituitary gland and throw the
body's hormonal system out of balance. Athletes often have fertility problems. Long-time
use of steroids can permanently damage the testicles.
• Drinking alcohol reduces sperm count in men.
• Do not overheat the testes. If you do, they will produce sterile sperm for several hours or
up to a day afterward. The testes must remain a half degree cooler than your core body
temperature. Fevers to the body, close-fitting underwear, or hot tub baths can cause this.
• Do not have intercourse for several days prior to the special fertile time.
• Tagamet and Zantac, two ulcer medications, decrease sperm counts and may even
produce impotence.
• In some cases, sperm count is so low that the only means of fertilization is artificial
insemination.
• If a varicocele is the problem, it must be treated by surgery.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ could have spent His days in self-seeking and idleness, but He chose to
come to earth and die so you could have eternal life. Trust your life to Him, and you will not regret it.
MALE IMPOTENCE—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL TREATMENT—Graduated Cold Baths; Cold Douche to spine, especially the lower part;
Cold Rubbing Sitz Bath, beginning at 600 F., lowering temperature 50 daily to 600 F.; duration of bath 3-
8 minutes and vigorously rubbed, to prevent chilling. If urethral irritation is present, short (2-4 minutes)
Revulsive Sitz Bath; Cooling Compress, 5 minutes daily.

Birth and Children
Part 2
Pregnancy and Childbirth

SYMPTOMS—Allergies, frigidity, infertility, amenorrhea, anorexia, anxiety neurosis, menopausal
melancholia, postpartum depression, premenstrual tension.
CAUSES—Women experience many stresses, because they have so many tasks: bearing children and
raising them, caring for the husband, working in and around the house, perhaps working outside the
home.
Increasing nutritional intake can help meet these stresses."
disease-general-morning-sickness,Morning Sickness,"TREATMENT
• Because morning sickness is caused by rising progesterone levels, you need a complex
carbohydrate (or possibly protein) snack upon awakening in the morning. This will relieve
much of the nausea.
• Keep crackers or whole-wheat toast near your bed and eat some as soon as you arise in
the morning. Pop them in your mouth, chew well, and swallow; then place your feet on
the floor.
• It helps to keep some food in the stomach all day long. Eat small and frequent meals, but
do not overeat. When needed, snack on whole-grain crackers, possibly with a little nut
butter (but not peanut butter).
• Another method is to carry some raw almonds with you, wherever you go. Make sure
they are not old and stale.
• Do not go without food or drink even though you feel nauseated and may vomit. You
must continue to have both!
• Vitamin B and the entire B complex is important. Essential fatty acids and a complete
6
line of nutritional supplements should be taken.
• Drink lots of fluids: water, fruit or vegetable juice, broth, or certain herbal teas.
• Avoid fried and fatty foods.
• Helpful herbs include dogwood, catnip, dandelion, mint, peppermint, and red raspberry
leaf. Ginger is helpful in relieving nausea.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord Jesus came to our world to save those who would come unto Him.
But He can save no one against His will. In Him you can find the rest, courage, and peace of heart that
you so much need.

SYMPTOMS—Nausea and vomiting by the mother between the sixth and twelfth weeks of pregnancy.
CAUSES—Although called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. Morning sickness is
caused by rising progesterone levels, and is quite normal.
Morning sickness is said to be a cleansing of the body, to prepare a clean environment in which the fetus
can properly develop.
But about 1 woman in 200 experiences an abnormal amount of vomiting and severe nausea. This can
result in acidosis, malnutrition, dehydration, and significant weight loss.
Possible causes of this abnormal condition include drug toxicity, vitamin deficiency (especially of B ),
6
pancreatitis, bile duct disease, inflammatory bowel disorders.
It can also be caused by the production of high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, which is a
hormone. Cysts in the uterus or multiple pregnancy can be the cause.
Morning sickness generally does not continue beyond the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. If there is
persistent vomiting or nausea later, consult with your health-care provider.
At its worst, morning sickness can degenerate into hyperemesis gravidarum. In this situation, the mother-
to-be has far too much vomiting and nausea; is overly dehydrated; not urinating properly; and cannot
keep food, water, and juice down for over a period of 4-6 hours.
This condition can lead to pulse irregularities, electrolyte imbalance, and even kidney and liver damage.
Ketones produced, when stored fat is broken down, can damage neurological development in the fetus.
How to avoid this danger? Do not stop eating and drinking fluids, even though you feel nauseated and
vomit."
disease-general-miscarriage,Miscarriage,"TREATMENT
• There can be deficiencies of vitamins, trace minerals, and/or protein. Vitamin A, folic
acid, zinc, and complete amino acids are especially important. Vitamin E is the
""antiabortion vitamin.""
• Taking iron supplements can block the absorption of vitamin E, resulting in a
miscarriage.
• It is vital that the mother-to-be take full vitamin/mineral supplementation, eat sufficient
amounts of good nourishing food, and avoid junk food of all types.
• Ignore the advice that you should eat what ever you want. If it is junk food, do not eat it!
If it is real food and you crave it, then eat it.
• Getting enough minerals in your diet will help you avoid a craving for sweets, chocolate,
etc. The cravings come because not enough vitamins, minerals, and complete proteins are
being consumed.
• There can also be malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease. Do pulse tests
(which see) to identify offending foods.
• If you have had an earlier miscarriage, in order prevent another one, start on a fully
nourishing diet six months before planned conception.
• Helpful herbs include cramp bark and alfalfa.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus understands. Go to Him and give Him all your heart. Trust your future
to Him, and He will wonderfully guide.

(Spontaneous Abortion)
SYMPTOMS—The fetus is ejected by the body prior to when normal delivery should occur.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—There can be cervical incompetence, ectopic pregnancy (implantation
of the fertilized egg into a fallopian tube), abruptio placentae (placenta separates from the uterine wall),
placenta previa (implantation of the placenta over the cervical opening).
Other causes include emotional stress, general malaise, glandular disorders, and pregnancy-induced
hypertension.
But a frequent, and often underlying, cause is malnutrition."
disease-general-mastitis,Mastitis,"TREATMENT
• Do not stop nursing the baby because you have mastitis! The milk is not infected, the
baby needs it, and you must keep giving it for months to come. The milk gives the baby
valuable antibodies. If you stop nursing, the mastitis could more easily lead to an abscess
in the breast.
• Go to bed, drink lots of clear fluids, and nurse more frequently.
• Alternate hot and cold compresses are often all the treatment required. Apply a hot
compress for 3 minutes, then cold for 30 seconds. Do this 3 times, and repeat the series 2-
3 times each day.
• Sometimes a continuous cold application is preferred. If so, give a hot footbath at the
same time.
• Nurse the affected breast twice as often, but for shorter periods of time. Try to keep it
emptied. Let no one tell you that you should stop nursing if you have mastitis! Keep
nursing; you will recover more quickly and the baby will not be injured.
• Obtain plenty of rest, including frequent rest periods throughout the day.
PREVENTION—The article, ""Breast-feeding,"" contains many important points.
Prevention of mastitis begins prior to childbirth. For 2-3 months, the mother-to-be must get her nipples
ready for lactation. She should massage the nipples daily with chickweed ointment. Vitamin E may also
be used. Perform the ""nipple pull"" several times each day during a shower.
During breast-feeding, position the baby right. Place the baby on breast correctly, emptying the breast
fully, and break suction properly. This should be followed by emptying the breast with a hand pump, if
necessary. Nipple cleanliness is also important. Proper clothing should be worn. All this and more is
explained in ""Breast-feeding.""
— Also see ""Fibrocystic Breast Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care. Go to God with
your trials and problems, and find in Him the solutions you so much seek.
Section 14
Birth and Children
Part 3
Birth Defects

SYMPTOMS—Breast inflammation: redness, pain, fever, inflammation, chills, hard swelling, malaise,
headache, and possibly swollen cervical and/or axillary lymph nodes.
CAUSES—Mastitis generally occurs between the fifth day after childbirth to the second or third
week—and especially occurs to mothers nursing their first baby. Usually limited to one breast, it must
be treated promptly or an abscess may develop. But treatment must be started within 12-18 hours after
the first symptoms are noted.
The breast and milk duct system has been invaded by staphylococci invading a fissured or cracked
nipple.
Causes include shallow grip on the nipple by the infant (see ""Breast-feeding""), incomplete emptying
during each feeding, blocked duct, poor nipple care and hygiene, irritating clothing, engorged breast
because of trying to wean the child off milk, irritating clothing, or lack of proper nipple preparation prior
to lactation. See ""Breast Feeding"" for proper routines.
Breast engorgement results from incomplete emptying each time. There can be excessive sucking by the
infant—if he is not properly positioned on the nipple (see ""Breast-feeding"")."
disease-general-birth-defects,Birth Defects,"SYMPTOMS—A variety of partially, or wholly, incapacitating physical or mental defects which are
present at birth.
CAUSES—More than 90% of birth defects are the result of preconception and early pregnancy
malnutrition of the mother. Such defects include cleft palates, cleft lips, heart defects, limb defects, spina
bifida, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart defects, brain defect, fetal hernia.
All of the above diseases have been eliminated from valuable livestock by the veterinary profession.
They have done this by giving the animals excellent nutrition.
It is well-known that bearing a child after the age of 40 can cause problems. But teenagers have a greater
percentage of children with birth defects than do women over 40, because of their general poor eating
habits and lack of vitamin/mineral supplementation. Many young people today live on junk food and
have damaged offspring as a result.
As an example, let us consider cystic fibrosis; it is a type of adrenal damage). It is classified as the ""most
common genetic defect""; yet, in reality, cystic fibrosis is a selenium and fatty acid deficiency in the fetus
and/or newborn breast-fed infant. If the mother has celiac disease, this can impede her absorption of
essential nutrients, especially selenium, even more.
In 1958, Dr. Kaus Schwartz reported in the NIH publication, Federal Proceedings, that selenium was an
essential nutrient. The deficiency symptoms he reported all fit cystic fibrosis. But no one paid attention.
In 1972, Cornell University found that chicks hatched from selenium deficient hens developed all the
classical symptoms of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. But they too did not connect the finding to
selenium.
But they also discovered that, if selenium was given to the chicks within 30 days after hatching, they
were totally cured within 21 days.
In 1978, J.D. Wallach, a veterinarian researcher, identified this problem in animals and birds as being
""cystic fibrosis."" But, when other researchers agreed with his findings, Wallach was fired within 24
hours from his government research laboratory.
Since that date, Wallach has treated over 450 CF patients with excellent results. He has cured three-
month-old infants of the disorder. Wallach later did joint research with the Chinese Government in their
hospitals, and helped thousands of their people.
Yet, in America, the people are told CF is a ""genetic defect"" and nothing can be done, except expensive
and time-consuming rehabilitation programs.
Dr. Arthur F. Coco, inventor of the pulse test, made this statement:
""I am a realist. As long as the profit is in the treatment of symptoms rather than a search for causes,
that's where the medical profession will go for its harvest.""
It is true that radiation is another cause of birth defects, yet only .1% of birth defects result from X rays,
etc. Most pregnant women realize that they should avoid them.
What is the solution to the problem? It is to give women a good nourishing diet. But it must begin a
couple years before conception!
Prevention of birth defects requires more than ""prenatal"" vitamins after the second month of pregnancy,
when the physician gives his pronouncement, ""You are pregnant."" By that time, the embryo has formed
all organs and tissues—for better or worse! Proper supplementation of vitamins and minerals, nourishing
food, and avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, drugs, and junk food must have had its effect on the
mother's body—before conception took place!
Do a home pregnancy test as soon as you suspicion the possibility, and immediately begin eating
nourishing food and taking supplements.
—A sample of such a birth defect is ""Cerebral Palsy."" Also see ""Cystic Fibrosis.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Faith is needed in the world today, faith that will lay hold on the promises of
God's Word and refuse to let go until Heaven hears."
disease-general-cerebral-palsy,Cerebral Palsy,"SYMPTOMS—A form of paralysis caused by a prenatal brain defect, characterized by involuntary
motions and difficulty in control of the voluntary muscles.
CAUSES—The cause of this disorder, which affects the fine motor coordination of the body, is a
deficiency of zinc and B in the mother's diet prior to, and during, the formation of the brain of the fetus.

It is possible that celiac disease (which see) was a factor in inducing this deficiency.
There is, at this time, no known treatment.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Let the afflictions which pain us so grievously draw us closer to God. Find in
Him the help that you need."
disease-general-down-syndrome,Down Syndrome,"TREATMENT

Infant Problems

(Mongolism)
SYMPTOMS—Slow physical development, moderate to severe mental retardation, and facial features
which are somewhat flattened. Ears are set low, tongue is large and furrowed, hands are broad and
short—and have a single (simian) crease across the palm.
CAUSES—Also called trisomy 21, Down syndrome occurs during fetal development, but is not
inherited. The problem is an extra 21st chromosome. It occurs in 1 out of 700 live births. People with
Down syndrome can, with care, live to old age, but they are prone to pneumonia and other lung diseases."
disease-general-cradle-cap,Cradle Cap,"TREATMENT
• Gently remove the crusts. Shampoo 2-4 times a week with a mild soap. Massage the
scalp gently, but firmly enough to remove the flakes. Do not break the inflamed skin
underneath.
• Massage vegetable oil into still-adhering flake areas; let set for a few minutes, then
shampoo it off.
• Repeat 1-3 times a week until the condition is gone.
• Include vitamin B (10-25 mg daily) and zinc (15-25 mg daily) in the infant's diet.
6
Check for food allergies (see ""Pulse Test"").
ENCOURAGEMENT—There is an ornament that will never perish, that will promote the happiness of
all around us in this life, and will shine with undimmed luster in the immortal future. It is the adorning
of a meek and quiet spirit.

(Infantile Seborrheic Dermatitis)
SYMPTOMS—Thin, whitish, flaky scales. Or thick, yellow, greasy crusts. Sometimes it spreads to the
eyelids, external ear canal, and nose.
CAUSES—Cradle cap is the most common scalp disorder of infants. About 50% have it at some time.
There is an overproduction of sebum, a waxy oil substance that may plug the sebaceous glands, leading
to inflammation and acne formation. The entire scalp can become covered with a thick mat of sebum
and dead skin cells.
Possible causes include food allergies. Of 187 infants which had it, in later years 67% later had an
allergy (whereas 20% have allergies in the general population).
The problem most frequently develops within the first 3 months and usually 3-4 weeks after introduction
of a new food. When that food was withdrawn, cradle cap cleared up. Most likely to cause problems:
milk, wheat, eggs, oranges, beans, peas, and sometimes oatmeal.
A deficiency of vitamin B and zinc may be involved.
6"
disease-general-colic-in-infants,Colic In Infants,"(Infant Colic)
SYMPTOMS—Stomach or intestinal pain in an infant. There is abdominal pain, distension, insomnia,
extreme fretfulness, or hysteria. The child cries out, pulls the knees up to the stomach, and has a
distended stomach.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• Abnormal amounts of gas are passing upward or downward, and this is causing pain.
• You can immediately give the infant warm catnip tea in a bottle. A catnip tea enema will
also help. Crying spells occur at regular intervals; so, if a very warm bath is given an hour
before an expected attack, it may be prevented. Have catnip tea on hand to use in an
emergency.
• In addition, a hot footbath or hot fomentation over the abdomen will relieve the baby.
• If the baby is totally breast-fed, the cause is in the mother's diet. Any food the mother
may eat may, through her milk, causes the baby to suffer infant colic; onions, cabbage,
garlic, wheat, yeast, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are common offenders. Another major
cause is fried food, junk food, refined food, and all types of confused food combinations.
Both the mother and the child need a good diet.
• Colic in a formula-fed infant points to the food given to the child. It may be the milk,
wheat, soy, or sugar in the formula. If possible, substitute vitamin-enriched goat's milk.
Also try to have the mother begin breast-feeding the baby. Even if she did not begin doing
it after delivery, she can, with some effort, get the flow started later. This is done by
frequent attempts to feed the baby over several months.
• If the infant is bottle-fed, for added nourishment at this time you might pour boiling
water over wheat flakes, to dissolve them; put them through a sieve; and add soybean
milk, to bring it to a desired consistency. Potassium broth and oatmeal gruel are also
helpful.
• If colic develops after weaning has begun, the new food is the problem. The infant must
be given proper foods and only one new food should be added at a time, so the infant can
be carefully monitored for colic, rashes, or other reactions.
• Wheat and dairy products are especially suspect. When in doubt, eliminate them first.
Wheat and other grains are often introduced far too early. But this can cause the child to
later develop celiac disease, which will affect him throughout life (see ""Celiac Disease"").
The infant does not have the digestive enzymes to handle grains until 5-6 months. Let
grains be one of the last foods introduced, and do not give yeast bread until after a year
old.
• Give fresh, boiled, goat's milk; it is far less of a problem.
• Keep diet diaries and do pulse testing, to ascertain offending foods (see ""Pulse Test"").
• It may help to give pancreatic enzymes (75-200 mg three times a day) before meals
(enzymes may be constipating), flaxseed oil (1-2 drops) after each meal, and vitamin B
6
(10 mg twice a day).
—Also see ""Colic in Children.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Speak words of hope and good cheer, and you will encourage all about you in
the pathway of life. Ask God to help you be a blessing to others."
disease-general-teething,Teething,"TREATMENT
• Massage the baby's gums, beginning before the teeth appear. Wrap a piece of clean
gauze around your finger, and rub the gums gently. This removes bacteria and gets him
used to having your finger in his mouth.
• Place teething rings in the refrigerator and then, when cold, give them to him to mouth.
This feels good on the gums. If the baby is 6 months or more old, a clean, cold, washcloth
does well.
• Wrap a piece of cold apple in a wet child-size washcloth, and let the infant mash on it to
help his gums.
ENCOURAGEMENT—True happiness is found in surrendering to Christ, and, by His grace, obeying
His Ten Commandment law.

SYMPTOMS—The baby's gums become swollen and tender, and he becomes irritable and restless.
Teething has begun!
CAUSES—An infant's teeth begin developing months before birth. In fact, the buds begin appearing in
the fetus by the fifth or sixth week of pregnancy!
All 20 teeth will begin coming through over two and a half years following birth, beginning about 4-8
months of age."
disease-general-neonatal-jaundice,Neonatal Jaundice,"TREATMENT
• If the baby is breast-fed more frequently, the bowel movements will carry bilirubin out
of the body faster. One research team found that the 3-4 hour feedings, recommended by
many hospitals, is incorrect; the feedings should be every 2 hours, in order to reduce
bilirubin levels.
• Activated charcoal is very helpful in lowering bilirubin levels. Stir 2-3 teaspoons
powdered charcoal into a little water, and give with a nipple. Beginning at 4 hours of age,
give it every two hours, for 120 hours in normal newborns, 168 hours in premature infants
or until bilirubin levels fall.
• Exposure to sunlight helps reduce bilirubin levels. It can fall on the infant a little through
the window or he can be taken outside. Do not let direct sunlight enter his eyes, but let it
fall on as much bare skin as possible. Of course, be careful and do not sunburn him.
ENCOURAGEMENT—By yielding your life to Christ, you can experience a peace and contentment
which will make life a joy rather than a burden.

SYMPTOMS—A yellowing of the skin is seen in the infant, appearing first in the upper body and
progressing downward toward the toes. In the full-term normal baby, it is first seen about the third day;
and, by the fifth day, it is disappearing. In a pre-term infant, jaundice may appear later, but last longer.
CAUSES—Jaundice is probably the most common disorder in newborn babies. Old blood is broken
down, by the liver, into bilirubin, a yellowish pigment. But when too much is made, the excess is
dumped into the bloodstream and is deposited in tissues for temporary storage. About a fifth of infants
have this, to one extent or another.
""Breast milk jaundice"" occurs in about 3% of infants. Peak levels of bilirubin do not occur until the tenth
or fifteenth day, and may not return to normal for 12 weeks. But do not stop breast-feeding during this
time.
If the baby has prolonged jaundice, have a thyroid check done; he might have a tendency toward
hypothyroidism (which see).
Certain drugs given to the mother during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breast-feeding can lead to
neonatal jaundice. This includes sulfonamides, hydrocortisone, Valium, Orinase, Gentamicin, thiazide
diuretics, and oral contraceptives."
disease-general-infantile-convulsions,Infantile Convulsions,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC ASPECTS—Regulate diet, withholding meats and all indigestibles. Avoid cow's milk if curds
are present in the stools. Daily Cold Bath, Wet Hand Rub, or Cold Towel Rub.
GENERAL CARE—When due to autointoxication from intestinal irritation, give a large Hot Enema.
For immediate relief, Hot Blanket Pack; Warm Bath, at 950-980 F., for 1-2 minutes. If not quickly
relieved, remove from bath and employ Cold Pail Pour to head and spine. Alternate Hot and Cold Pail
Pour, if necessary. Apply Hot Abdominal Pack, changing every 4 hours."

water drinking; large Warm Enema.
—Also see ""Cholera,"""
disease-general-sudden-infant-death-syndrome,Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Give careful attention to each of the above factors.
• Both the mother and child should receive nourishing food. If the infant is breast-fed, the
mother's diet should be excellent; if the baby is bottle-fed, then, if possible, fresh boiled
goat's milk should be used. Mothers should nurse their babies, if at all possible.
• Locate allergenic foods and eliminate them.
• The mother should avoid chemicals, drugs, and junk food during and after pregnancy.
Even aspirin is not good (it interferes with blood clotting, and could damage the fetus).
• Do not use caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco; they harm the unborn child, so it does not
develop properly.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Heaven is very near to those who suffer for righteousness' sake. Christ
identifies His interests with the interests of His faithful ones. Be His little child, and He will care for
you.

Birth and Children
Part 5
Childhood Problems
BED-WETTING—1
(Enuresis)
SYMPTOMS—A child continues to wet the bed.
CAUSES—Bed wetters tend to have a small bladder capacity; this makes it difficult for them to go
through the night without voiding. They also tend to urinate more frequently during the day.
Here are the frequency statistics: 50% wet by the age of 2; 10-15% by 4; 4% at 12. Boys do it more
frequently than girls, but girls can develop urinary tract infections from it.
A primary cause of bed-wetting is allergy. Their parents are more likely to have hives, hay fever, urinary
tract infection, food allergies, or drug allergies.
Food allergies in the children are responsible for many cases. The most frequent problem foods were
cow's milk (60% of the time), chocolate, eggs, citrus fruits, wheat, grains, corn, chicken, meat, peanuts,
and fish. You would need to do pulse tests, to determine the problem food (see ""Pulse Test"").
Hyperactive children tend to be bed wetters.
Constipation may at times be involved, by pressing on the bladder.
Some children, especially older ones, continue to wet the bed because of tensions they live under in the
home or at school.
Removing milk from the diet reduced bed wetting in 50% of a group being studied.
Anemia, pinworms, upper respiratory tract infections, or any toxic condition can be contributing factors.
• Consider all the above factors.
• A common method is to have the child stop and start the flow of urine each time he
urinates. This causes him to acquire better mental control of the function. This may solve
the problem in as little as six weeks.
• Spanking the child is not the solution! Do not praise and do not punish. The child does
not do it on purpose, and he is sorry. Just change the bed and do not say a word. —But
keep working on possible solutions listed here. No child wants to do it.
• The child should be encouraged to have vigorous outdoor exercise. (It is known that bed
wetters wet less during the summer months, and some who have stopped may return to it
in the winter.)
• In children over 10, limit the amount of fluid intake after 5 p.m. at night, until several
months after bed-wetting ceases.
• Bed-wetting alarms can be purchased. They often wake up everyone at night, but are
often supposed to accomplish the task within 60 days.
• Victory is said to come with 21 days of consecutive dry nights.
—For incontinence in adults, see ""Bed-wetting—2"" and ""Incontinence.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—While the Lord has not promised His people exemption from trials, He has
promised that which is far better. He has said, ""As thy days, so shall thy strength be."" ""My grace is
sufficient for thee.""
BED-WETTING—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
IMPROVE GENERAL AND LOCAL NERVE TONE—Cold Pail Pour at 750 F. at bedtime,
followed by Neutral Pail Pour to spine, 2 minutes, 960 F. Sea bathing and swimming, if this is available.
Avoid water drinking for 2 hours before retiring. Aseptic dietary. Meats and salts especially to be
avoided.
RELIEVE CONSTIPATION—and flatulence when present by Hot Abdominal Pack; Graduated
Enema; if necessary, carefully Graduated Cold Baths; Cool Enema; and proper diet.
DIMINISH ACIDITY OF URINE—by free use of fruit and water drinking in the forenoon.
—Also see ""Bed-wetting—1.""

(SIDS)
SYMPTOMS—The infant suddenly dies.
CAUSES—There is no advance warning or symptom. That is what it is called ""sudden infant death
syndrome."" The central nervous system is affected, which in turn suppresses the involuntary act of
breathing.
Each year, in the United States, there are 10,000 deaths from this problem. SIDS primarily occurs in the
winter, primarily to underweight babies from poor families, and the mothers are generally under 20.
Several possible causes have been traced:
There may be high blood levels of the toxic mineral, lead. It has been reported that there are high levels
of lead in infants who die of SIDS.
Suffocation may be the cause. It has been found that infants who were laid on their stomachs, to go to
sleep, are much more likely to suddenly die than infants who are laid on their backs.
Breast-fed babies are less susceptible to SIDS. In addition, they have less allergies, respiratory diseases,
hypoglycemia, obesity, and gastroenteritis.
It is now known that SIDS can be caused by the pertussis vaccine, which is given to infants at 2, 4, and 6
months of age."
disease-general-colic-in-children,Colic In Children,"TREATMENT
• Put into bed, and give warm catnip tea in a bottle.
— Also see “Colic in Infants.”
ENCOURAGEMENT—True happiness is found in learning of Christ and living for Him. Those who
take Christ at His Word and surrender their soul to His keeping will find peace and quietude.

SYMPTOMS—The child cries out, pulls the knees up to the stomach, and has a distended stomach. His
stomach and/or intestines hurt.
CAUSES—Pressure from gas moving upward or downward causes pain. The cause is usually improper
food or constipation. Indigestion is the most frequent cause."
disease-general-ringworm,Ringworm,"TREATMENT
• Vitamins A, E, and zinc are important.
• Put plantain and castor oil on the affected area.
• Place ultraviolet light on the area for at least 6 minutes a day. This can be sunlight, or a
sunlamp. Never place a sunlamp closer than 18 inches from the skin.
• Apply apple cider vinegar to the area several times a day.
• Equally useful is castor oil, goldenseal tea, and borax. Rub the area with borax and with
castor oil.
• A 3-day citrus fast is very helpful, cleansing the bowels daily. Follow this with a
nutritious diet.
• Eat plenty of garlic. Put raw garlic over the ringworm and cover. You can also use black
walnut extract. Wash the area with garlic juice or wormwood.
• Place freshly cut garlic 3 times a day on the area. This is a very good remedy. Blend the
garlic with a little water and apply as a soak, compress, or poultice. But this remedy is too
powerful to apply to raw flesh between the toes; it can burn lower layers of skin.
• Take 2 chaparral or wormwood capsules daily.
• The scalp can be shampooed with tar soap and borax. Moisten the area every morning
and evening with goldenseal (1 teaspoon) and myrrh (½ teaspoon), which has been
steeped in a pint of boiling water.
• An herb tea can also be taken internally: goldenseal or plantain, twice a day.
• Make a salve from equal parts of burdock root, chaparral, wormwood, and chickweed;
apply to the area. Some of it can also be made into a tea to drink in order to fight the
fungus internally.
• Keep the skin clean and dry. Ringworm likes damp skin. Take frequent baths, but dry
thoroughly each time. Rub briskly with a towel, to remove the outer dead layers of skin
that the ringworm initially attacks.
• Do not scratch. Keep fingernails cut short, to lessen accidental scratching and spreading
of the infection.
• To remove crusts, soak the area in a saline solution. An alternate method is to apply
moist cloths for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day.
• To treat nails: Pare and scrape the infected area, and try to remove as much of the loose
material beneath the nails. Apply vinegar with a Q-tip twice a day. Keep at it, even though
it may require months to eliminate. Fungus of the nails is the slowest to conquer.
—Also see ""Athlete's Foot,"" which is a type of ringworm fungus.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Nothing of the world can make you sad, when you have submitted your heart
to be molded by the Spirit of Christ. He alone can provide you with the answers you need.

SYMPTOMS—Small, flat, red, slightly elevated ring or oval-shaped sores, which may be crusted, dry,
scaly, or moist. The centers of the sores heal as the sores spread outward. The result is an infected ring.
Itching, burning, or pain may be present. The lesions appear to be circular. The area is often covered
with small blisters.
When the scalp is affected, the hair falls out in circular patches. The fingers can also be affected.
CAUSES—Ringworm is a very contagious disease, caused by a parasitic fungus. It can infect children
or adults, and is caused by unsanitary conditions. Keep the hands clean! Pet the dog and then rub your
face, and you may regret it.
Ringworm of the beard (face) is more persistent than ringworm of the scalp. Ringworm of the body is
the easiest to eliminate.
Dogs, cats, rabbits, children, and contaminated clothing are generally the carriers of the disease.
There are several different types of ringworm, all of which are of fungal origin:
Ringworm of the scalp - This can be on the scalp, face, and on the nails, is the most noticeable kind. It is
highly contagious, and often found on school-children. It frequently induces baldness, which may
become permanent if hair shafts are destroyed by the fungus.
Ringworm of the trunk - This includes “jockey itch,” and is spread by contact with people or their
clothing. Dogs and cats can also spread it.
Ringworm of the nails - This consists of a fungus growing under the nails. It produces thickened,
misshapen, brittle, discolored, chalky, pitted, or grooved nails. The nails can either be on the hands or
the feet. This type of ringworm is quite difficult to eliminate.
Ringworm of the feet - This is also known as athlete's foot (see ""Athlete's Foot"")."
disease-general-childhood-diseases,Childhood Diseases,"TREATMENT
• Give a liquid diet in the acute stages, followed by fruits and vegetables later. Do not
suppress the fever with drugs. Use water therapy treatments, to help the body fight the
infection. The bowels must be kept open by means of herbal enemas and, if needed, herbal
laxatives.
• Treat the kidneys and bowels, so they can keep discharging toxins. Sweating therapy can
be used, to bring waste products out through the skin.
• Garlic is helpful, along with the fruit and vegetable juices, and herb teas.
• Vitamins A and C, with bioflavonoids, in abundant amounts is needed.
• Never, never, give aspirin to a child or youth who has a fever! It can lead to Reye's
disease (which see) which can cause irreversible coma or death.
• This is what happens: The child has a fever, and aspirin is given. There is improvement
for a day or two,—then a sudden turn for the worst, and coma or death follows.
—Also see ""Reye's Syndrome.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Worry is blind and cannot discern the future; but, trusting in Jesus, you need
not fear. Take His hand and He will lead you step by step.
TONSILLITIS—1, ADENITIS, STREP THROAT, AND QUINSY
SYMPTOMS—Inflammation and possible infection of the tonsils and the adenoids. If streptococcal
bacteria have caused the infection, it is called strep throat. There is a sore throat with fever, lack of
appetite, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, nasal obstruction and discharge. The lymph
glands may become swollen. Symptoms continue for 24-72 hours, and then gradually subside over 7-10
days. The tonsils may look red and enlarged, and pus may be observed.
CAUSES—The tonsils and adenoids are glands containing lymphatic tissue, located in the upper throat.
Both are part of the immune system; they protect the body, at the top of the gastrointestinal tract, against
infection. Each tonsil contains 200 million lymphocytes. We will here primarily deal with tonsillitis;
treatment for adenitis is essentially the same. Strep throat also has the same treatment.
When the body's resistance is lowered, viruses or bacteria (usually streptococcal) set to work. And a diet
of processed and junk food, that is high in carbohydrates and low in protein, can also bring on this
condition.
If streptococcal infection (strep throat) is not present, then the throat condition is eliminated much
quicker.
If not cared for properly, strep throat can be potentially dangerous and can lead to rheumatic fever or
meningitis.
Food allergies weaken the body: usually cow's milk, chocolate, or too much white-flour or sugar
products. Cow's milk or wheat are the two primary allergens to beware of.
Antibiotics weaken the body more.
The more frequently this infection occurs, the more difficult it is to eliminate. The tonsils become
scarred from previous inflammations.
Quinsy is peritonsillar abscess. It is an infection of the tonsil, between the tonsil and the pharyngeal
constrictor muscle. The solution is not a tonsillectomy, but the care specified below.
• Cold applications to the throat may bring relief and shorten the high point of the
infection. This could be an ice collar or flannel wrung out of cold water and changed
frequently.
• Hot salt-water gargles will help. To increase blood circulation in the throat, do alternate
hot and cold gargling.
• Gargle with goldenseal tea, drinking it as you do this (1 cup 3-4 times a day).
• Place a heating compress on the throat at other times. Put a strip of cotton sheet, dipped
and wrung out of cold water, in a strip of dry wool on his throat.
• Give a hot footbath, along with hot (5 minutes) and cold (5 minutes) cloths to the throat
(2-3 times daily). Finish with a cold mitten friction to the whole body. Then immediately
put into a warm bed and let him rest.
• Drink plenty of liquids. Fresh juices are the best. Drink fruit and vegetable juices, green
drink, and lots of water. Avoid sugar, processed and junk food. A cleansing juice fast,
alternated with vegetable broths, for 3 days is helpful. Lemon or lime juice in warm water
with honey and ginger will help the cleansing process. Peppermint tea will help settle the
stomach.
• Maintain a high intake of vitamin C. It powerfully fights the infection and also produces
interferon which does the same. With the light meals, include vitamin A, selenium, and
zinc.
• Let him dissolve a charcoal tablet several times a day. It will both soothe the throat and
combine with toxins.
• Catnip tea enemas are good for fevers.
• Golden seal, echinacea, and garlic act as antibiotics. Tee tree oil helps heal the throat
infection. Fenugreek and comfrey loosens the mucous and carries it out of the body.
• A ¼ teaspoon of lobelia extract, swallowed every 2 hours, will help alleviate fever, pain,
and swelling.
• Avoid people who smoke. Children whose parents are smokers have very high rates of
tonsil infections.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Strength for today, courage for tomorrow, trusting Christ and obeying Him,
we can have all this and more.
TONSILLITIS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
(1) ACUTE FORM —
DIETARY FACTORS—Rest in bed, keep room a uniform temperature, spare diet consisting chiefly of
fruits, avoid meats of all sorts, copious water drinking.
GENERAL CARE—Hot Blanket Pack; sweating Wet Sheet Pack; Steam Bath; Radiant Heat Bath; Hot
Full Bath, followed by Dry Pack or other sweating procedures once daily, followed by Cold Mitten
Friction, Cold Wet Sheet Rub, or Cold Douche. Fomentation to the throat 3 times daily; Cold Compress
between, changed every 15-30 minutes. Enema if bowels are inactive. Hot gargle every few minutes if
throat is very sensitive. Ice Bag to throat if inflammation is intense. Inhalation of soothing vapors; use of
steam inhaler 10-14 minutes hourly or almost continuously. If tonsil suppurates (pusses), it should be
lanced. See your doctor.
(2) CHRONIC FORM —
CLERGYMAN'S SORE THROAT DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE—Aseptic dietary, out-of-door
life, open air gymnastics, swimming.
GENERAL CARE—Fomentations to throat at bedtime, followed by throat pack (Cold Compress)
during the night; hot gargle 3 times a day. Radiant Heat Bath; sweating Wet Sheet Pack; Steam Bath or
other sweating bath, 3 times weekly, followed by suitable cold application. Daily Cold Bath on rising.
Moist Abdominal Bandage to be worn during the night. If necessary, remove tonsils and vegetations in
throat or postnasal region.
—See also ""Tonsillitis—1.""

SYMPTOMS—Fevers, rashes, coughs, sore throat, weakness, etc.
CAUSES—The childhood diseases include chicken pox, measles, mumps, German measles (rubella),
rheumatic fever, whooping cough, and scarlet fever (all of which see).
Most of these common childhood diseases are contracted by nearly all children. Some experience only
mild cough or cold while others have serious cases. A few receive permanent damage.
If the child is receiving excellent nutrition— exercise, rest, sunshine, fresh air, etc.—he is unlikely to
experience serious difficulty with these diseases. Louis Pasteur, developer of the germ theory of disease,
said, ""The germ is nothing; it is the soil that matters."" If the person is living a good life, the germ has a
hard time obtaining a foothold.
Avoid excess milk and carbohydrates, especially refined ones. Avoid sugar, fried food, and junk food.
Include vitamin and mineral supplements in a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and
similar natural foods.
A well-fed child will usually be strong enough to resist the onslaught of childhood diseases. He may
contract them; but the case will not be serious, usually brief, and often mild."
disease-general-adenoids,Adenoids,"TREATMENT
• Do a 3-5 day fast on diluted citrus juices. Follow this with a careful diet.
• Three times a day, give herb teas such as red clover, sassafras, and burdock root.
• Gargle several times a day with goldenseal tea. Echinacea and myrrh are very good for
all glandular swellings.
— Also see ""Tonsillitis"" and ""Childhood Diseases.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus sees the end from the beginning. He can plan for you better than you can
plan for yourself.

(Adenoid Hypertrophy)
SYMPTOMS—It hurts at the back of the child's throat. When he opens his mouth, the area of the
tonsils appears red and swollen.
CAUSES—What is commonly called adenoids is enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil, which is a tissue
close to the tonsils. This infection frequently occurs in children."
disease-general-chickenpox,Chickenpox,"TREATMENT
• Drink freshly made juices, with added protein powder and brewer's yeast. Drink
vegetable broth.
• When the fever drops and appetite returns, give mashed bananas and fresh raw
applesauce. Use a light fat-free, sugar-free, diet. You can give vitamin C to bowel
tolerance.
• Catnip tea, with a little molasses, is good during the fever. If the child is over two, catnip
tea enemas will help reduce the fever.
• The only real concern with childhood chickenpox is pock scarring. This may be
minimized by several simple baths and applications. And, of course, do not scratch.
• To avoid scratching the pocks, keep the child's nails short, to minimize spreading of the
infection. Have the child wear mittens or gloves, to avoid scratching—especially at night.
Instead of scratching, apply pressure to the area. Bathe him often.
• Relieve itching with calamine lotion, moist baking soda, or starch baths. Vitamin E oil
can be applied directly to each papule.
• A deep, warm, 15-minute bath at the onset of the disease will help the pox develop more
rapidly. Keep the head cool. Do not let him become chilled.
• Each day, give a tepid bath, followed by a change of clothes and linens. Protect against
chilling while bathing and other times. Chickenpox pneumonia can develop!
• Oatmeal baths are soothing, because they are alkaline. Put 1 pound of uncooked oatmeal
(or 1 heaping cup of uncooked rolled oats, ground fine, in a blender) in a bag made of 2
thicknesses of old sheeting. Soften it with hot water and then float it in the bathtub or hang
it, so the faucet will flow through it. You can use the bag to gently sponge the body. Pat
dry when finished; do not rub.
• If needed, mix 1 level teaspoon of salt with 1 pint (2 cups) of water, and gargle with it.
• Avoid constipation.
• If you contract chickenpox as an adult, go on a fasting program of fruit and vegetable
juices, interspersed with light meals.
• Keep the infected child away from newborn infants, elderly people, and pregnant
women. They may not have had chickenpox before.
• Do not send the child back to school until all lesions have finished being crusted.
• Antibiotics and corticosteroids do not help in any way, and should not be given.
• Do not give aspirin! About 10% of Reye's syndrome (which see) cases occur after
chickenpox, as a result of aspirin dosages. Reye's can cause irreversible coma or death.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Guard against the tendency to forget God. You dare not do this. He is the only
one who can give you the help you need every day.
MUMPS—1
SYMPTOMS—Swelling of one or both salivary glands, fever (up to 104o F.), chills, headache, sore
throat, and pain when swallowing or chewing. Swelling often occurs in one gland first, and then begins
in the other as swelling in the first subsides. But it may occur on only one side.
CAUSES—Mumps is an infection of the salivary (parotid) glands, located in front of, and below, each
ear. It rarely occurs before 3 years of age or after 40. Either direct contact or droplets spread the disease.
Mumps is not as contagious as chickenpox or measles. But a person with the disease is still contagious
from 48 hours, before symptoms develop, to 6 days afterward. Incubation is 14 to 21 days.
One bout and lifetime immunity generally follows.
If it is acquired after puberty, the ovaries or testes may become involved and sterility may result. Other
complications can also occur, which affect the heart, kidneys, and brain.
If no complications occur, complete recovery generally occurs within about 10 days.
Swollen salivary glands can be caused by several other diseases: A partial list includes cirrhosis of the
liver, leukemia, lupus, and tuberculosis (all of which are dealt with in this book). It also includes strep
throat and the taking of certain drugs. If it is an isolated case of ""mumps,"" it might actually be something
else.
• Keep the diet simple, fat-free, and sugar-free. Avoid foods that require chewing or might
be irritating. Eat mostly raw fruits and vegetables that are juiced or softened.
• Drink plenty of pure water and fresh juices. This will keep the body working well, help
flush toxins, and render it less likely that complications may occur.
• Do not eat junk food of any type. Avoid caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, soft drinks, etc.
Avoid acidic foods, such as pickles or citrus fruits.
• To relieve pain, cold or warm compresses (whichever feels best) may be placed on the
neck and over the glands. But avoid hot or icy cold applications.
• If nausea and/or pain on swallowing becomes so severe that the person becomes unable
to eat, intravenous administration of dextrose and fluids may be needed.
• Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death! (See ""Reye's
Syndrome."")

MEASLES—1
(Rubeola)
SYMPTOMS—First symptoms are fever, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and inflammation of the
eyes. The eyes may become red and sensitive to light. Within 24-48 hours, small red spots with white
centers appear on the insides of the cheeks. A rash appears 3-5 days later on the sides of the neck,
forehead, and ears; then it spreads over 5-7 days to the rest of the body. As it spreads, the fever subsides.
CAUSES—There are two types of measles: common measles (rubeola) and German measles (rubella;
which see). Common measles is highly contagious, and spread by droplets from the nose, throat, and
mouth. At the present time, adolescents and young adults are affected more often than children. If the
person was previously healthy, the disease will pass within 10 days.
But it can be followed by one of several serious complications, including pneumonia, bronchitis, croup,
middle-ear infection, meningitis, encephalitis, or injury to the nervous system.
So be very careful, during the disease and for a time afterward. Eat right; live right. Get lots of rest for a
time. Take it easy.
Approximately 98% of the population have had common measles. Lifelong immunity follows the
infection.
• He should be isolated in a room which is well-ventilated. If he is sensitive to light,
darken the room. He should not read or watch television. Keep the lights dim.
• Drink plenty of water and fruit and vegetable juices.
• Fevers increase the body's need for calories and vitamins A and C. He should be
encouraged, but not forced, to eat. Frequent small meals of nourishing food may be best.
• Avoid processed foods.
• Rest until the rash and fever have disappeared.
• Garlic or catnip tea enemas help lower fever.
• If a cough is present, cool moisture from a vaporizer may help. But water given
copiously is the best cough medicine.
• A hot bath may help reduce the fever. Place the child in a hot tub (105o-108o F.) for one
minute for each year of his age. Keep the head cool. This may be repeated every 2 hours.
Dress him warmly afterward, so chilling does not occur.
• Bronchitis may occur, and can be treated with hot fomentations to the chest. Apply them
twice a day, along with a hot footbath. A heating compress can be applied at night.
• Helpful herbs include yarrow, pleurisy root, and marigold.
• Antibiotics are useless against measles and do not decrease the likelihood of
complications. But it could be used, in an emergency, if complications occur.
• Complications can be serious, but are unlikely in the developed nations. Most such
problems stem from secondary bacterial infection, primarily middle-ear infection or
pneumonia. But special care and vigorous use of simple natural remedies can generally
deal with them.
• Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death! (See ""Reye's
Syndrome."")

MEASLES, GERMAN (
Rubella)
SYMPTOMS—Fatigue, coughing, headache, mild fever, muscle aches, and stiffness in the neck. A
pink rash often develops 1-5 days later. It generally first appears on the face and neck, and the spreads to
the rest of the body.
CAUSES—As we mentioned earlier, there are two types of measles: common measles (rubeola) and
German measles (rubella). Which see. Common measles is highly contagious, can have serious
complications if cautions are not taken, but usually passes within 10 days. (See ""Measles."")
But German measles (rubella) is different in certain ways. It is usually a mild contagious illness with a
rapid recovery period (5-7 days). But it is dangerous if a woman contracts it during the first trimester
(first 3 months) of her pregnancy. Then she might give birth to a child with heart defects, deafness,
mental retardation, or blindness.
Therefore a pregnant woman must guard against exposure to it.
• Follow treatment specified for common measles (see ""Measles"").
What precautions should a woman take?
• A pregnant woman must avoid exposure to German measles. The disease should be
considered contagious from 1 week before the rash appears until 1 week after the rash
fades.
• If she thinks she has been exposed to the disease, she can immediately see a physician
and request that she be given a gamma-globulin injection. If given soon after exposure, it
may reduce the severity of the disease or possibly prevent it from occurring.
• Immunity to German measles can be determined by a special blood test. She may wish to
be vaccinated. If this is done, pregnancy must be avoided for 3 months following
immunization.
• Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death! (See ""Reye's
Syndrome."")

ENCOURAGEMENT—God has given, in the Bible, sufficient evidence that it is from Him. Study and
obey it, and God will guide you day by day as you pray for help.
SCARLET FEVER—1 (Scarlatina)
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms appear 2-7 days after exposure. Vomiting, along with sore throat and
headache. Within a day, high fever develops. Throat membrane is inflamed, and soft palate may show a
fine light-red rash.
The tongue is coated white, but on the second day reddened raised points show through, especially at the
tip and sides.
The throat condition becomes more severe, with redness and enlargement of glands under lower jaw.
The rash usually begins on the chest within 1-2 days after the first symptoms, and later extends to other
parts of the body and limbs. But infection can occur without a rash occurring.
CAUSES—Scarlet fever is an acute contagious disease and is caused by one of several different
streptococci germs. Urine and discharges from nose, mouth, ears, and any abscesses are highly
infectious. One attack generally brings lifelong immunity, and few contract it after the age of 15.
The fever usually does not remain high more than 4 days, and the rash fades within a week. The more
intense the rash, the more scaling forms on the skin.
Inflammation of the ear is one of the most frequent complications of scarlet fever. The infection in the
throat passes up the Eustachian tube into the middle ear (see ""Earache and Infection""). Children can
become deaf as a result.
The infection may extend from the ear to the mastoid cells in the bone behind the ear, or to the
membranes covering the brain, or to both, producing mastoiditis (which see), brain abscess, or
meningitis (which see). These conditions are serious and often fatal.
Rheumatic fever (which see) frequently follows scarlet fever, and this sometimes results in inflammation
of the lining membranes and valves of the heart.
Enlargement of the lymph glands of the neck can turn into an abscess of these glands, as late as 5-6
weeks after the disease began.
In a child well-advanced toward recovery (especially in the third week), nephritis (which see; it is a
kidney infection) can develop. So this is another danger to be warded off by proper treatment.
Scarlet fever is not a matter to be taken lightly.
You do well to call a physician, if possible. He may need to lance the middle ear if infection develops.
He will probably examine the heart daily for indications of damage and do frequent urinalysis for signs
of nephritis.
• Put him on a fruit and vegetable juice fast, followed by a simple diet of fruits,
vegetables, and broths for a time.
• Inadequate care, improper food, and too early physical activity are the chief dangers.
• This is a contagious disease, so proper precautions must be taken.
• If the temperature goes above 103o F., reduce it by means of tepid sponges.
• If there is a sore throat, apply hot fomentation twice a day to the area, followed by
continuous heating compresses.
• When the rash begins to appear, give a long-continued hot footbath, along with hot
drinks, all the while keeping him covered with blankets. The objective is to get him to
sweat. But, afterward, guard against chilling!
• To help prevent kidney damage, when he goes back on food, eliminate eggs, meat, meat
broths, and legumes from the diet. Give him only milk, cereals, fruit juices, pureed
vegetables, and all the water he will drink.
• To hasten the scaling of the skin, and get it over with, give a daily sponge bath with
warm water and mild soap, followed by an olive oil rub.
• Keep him in bed at least 3 weeks, even though he feels well! Muscular activity too soon
can result in kidney damage.
• Helpful herbs include black rose, twinleaf, and bloodroot.

Hand Rub, Cold Mitten Friction, Cold Towel Rub. Prolonged chilling of the skin must be carefully
avoided.
—Also see ""Scarlet Fever—1.""
DIPHTHERIA—1
SYMPTOMS—It begins with sore throat and fever. Frequently a dirty, white or grayish, membrane
forms in the throat or nose, or both. There are slight chills, possible vomiting and diarrhea, always fetid
breath, difficulty in swallowing, and hoarseness.
Children first complain of feeling tired and sleepy. The tonsils appear inflamed, dark red, and unevenly
swollen. White, parchment-like patches appear on them. The glands in the neck usually swell.
CAUSES—Diphtheria is an acute contagious disease. It begins 3-8 days after exposure and primarily
occurs between 1 and 10 years of age.
Part of the danger is the obstruction to breathing, due to the above-mentioned false membrane and is
partly due to the toxins carried by the diphtheria germs which, carried throughout the body, especially
harm the heart muscles, nerves, and kidneys.
This is a serious disease. Diphtheria is transmitted by clothing, contact, domestic animals, and
sometimes by raw milk. Anything (dish, garment, etc.) coming in contact with the person must be
disinfected.
Individuals can carry the germs on them for several years and transmit them to still others. A carrier
should be isolated until the germs can no longer be found in his throat, nose, or catarrhal discharge.
If there are no white patches or developing membrane, it is not diphtheria.
The membrane is tenacious and dangerous. If not checked, it will cover the air tube and the child will
suffocate. It is generally whitish, but may appear yellowish or greenish. When the child breathes harder
and then has a frightened look, his air flow is narrowing.
When someone develops diphtheria, there must be no delay. Give him vigorous treatment. You will
want to call a physician.
• Give the child all the water he can drink, and keep him in bed, in a well-ventilated room.
Avoid chilling him. Too early exercise may overstrain the heart. The diet should be liquid.
Fast on carrot juice or fresh citrus juices.
• If the child insists on eating something, give him bananas, raisins, figs, and
oranges—and no other food. It is best to give him only liquids (water and fresh juices)
until he is cleaned out, the throat is clean, and the phlegm and false membrane are totally
gone.
• After the disease appears to be ended, give him no meat for quite some time (better not
to give it to him at all).
• Give him warm baths.
• An emetic is usually needed, to empty the stomach of putrefying matter; otherwise high
fevers will result. Lobelia in water can be given, but combined with bayberry bark is
better. The vomiting must be repeated until the stomach and throat are entirely clean.
• As the disease progresses, lobelia and bayberry bark tea can be given at any time, to
clean out the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Bayberry cleans the membrane
and eliminates the odor. It is also healing and antiseptic. A very small amount of cayenne
or ginger can be added as stimulants.
• Problems can develop while the child is sleeping—serious ones. Therefore, always give
him the emetic before he goes to sleep each time. Otherwise he might suffocate in his
sleep.
• Give him an enema every morning and evening. This helps clean out toxins from the
diphtheria germs. An herb tea can be added to detoxify the colon: bayberry, white oak
bark, or red raspberry. There should be at least 3-4 movements a day.
• Bayberry is excellent in all throat or stomach mucous conditions.
• If the heart rate is rapid, apply an ice bag over the heart.
• In case of headaches, place cold compresses or ice bags to the head and neck.
• A gargle can be made of goldenseal and myrrh, with a pinch of cayenne. Use this every
half hour. It will clean the mucous and germs out of the throat.
• Apply hot and cold fomentations over the liver, stomach, kidneys, and spine to keep the
circulation normal. This stimulates the lymphatic system, to help clean out toxins.
• If there is any danger of paralysis, give hot and cold applications to the spine, stomach,
and liver.
• Give 2 high enemas daily.
• If symptoms of heart failure appear, give a half teaspoon of cayenne in hot water. Have
him drink it all down immediately. Repeat if necessary.
• Each day, clean all clothing and bed linens by boiling them.
• As he begins to recuperate, he can be given baked apples, potato peeling broth, fresh
fruits, cooked vegetables, and soy milk.
• If properly cared for, the disease will end within 7-10 days.
• Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death! (See ""Reye's
Syndrome."")

WHOOPING COUGH—1
(Pertussis)
SYMPTOMS—A week or two after exposure, the catarrhal stage begins. The eyes may be red, and the
child seems to have a cold in the head. There is sneezing and watering of the eyes. Then a persistent
cough develops, especially bad at night. This coughing continues a week, and keeps getting worse—and
is the most significant indication that the problem may be whooping cough.
In about 2 weeks, the typical whoop begins. At first, only 1-2 times a day, it degrades to every time there
is coughing. It is a deep breath at the end of a series of deep coughs. The child's face may be reddish or
bluish from the effort and lack of air. Vomiting may also occur.
This whooping stage lasts 3-6 weeks, and the cough may not entirely disappear for several months.
CAUSES—Whooping cough is a contagious bacterial disease, which usually attacks children between 6
months and 5 years of age. But infants and adults can also be affected. A person rarely has a second
attack of this disease.
The disease is not highly contagious after the first few weeks. The most contagious phase is before a
definite diagnosis is possible.
Whooping cough occurs more frequently, and seriously, in overcrowded and unhygienic quarters and
cold weather. In very young, delicate, or undernourished children, it is more likely to develop into
broncho-pneumonia—the principle cause of death in cases of whooping cough.
Complications include convulsions, bleeding from the nose, into brain, or area around eyes. Broncho-
pneumonia can also occur; death only rarely.
You may choose to have the child vaccinated at an early age (2 months is recommended for the series).
You should weigh the fact that pertussis vaccine is one of the most dangerous of the shots in its
occasional side effects.
• Treat the cough—When a cough first develops, treat that cough! If you do so, the
whooping cough phase can be entirely prevented!
• Wild cherry bark tea is excellent. Here are other herbs useful for coughs; select from
those you have on hand or can most easily obtain. They can be mixed: black cohosh,
flaxseed, rosemary, comfrey, horehound, hyssop, myrrh, white pine, bloodroot, red sage,
blue violet, ginseng, coltsfoot. Prepare a tea and give a teaspoonful every hour until the
cough is better.
• Be sure and include other worthwhile practices, such as partial or complete fasting on
fruit and vegetable juices until the cough is past. In all kinds of coughs, first cleanse the
system with high herb enemas and a herbal laxative.
• When the cough is severe, as in whooping cough, have him drink warm water, one cup
after another, then stick your finger down his throat and have him vomit.
• A light diet is essential. Overfeeding during the whooping cough prolongs the disease
and leads to complications. In case it is a breast-fed infant, do not overfeed either. The
child is thirsty, not hungry.
• As soon as it is perceived that the problem is whooping cough, place him on a full fruit
juice fast. First, give citrus juices. This can be followed by other fruit juices; then carrot
and other vegetable juices, and clear vegetable broth soup. Later still, fruit can be added.
• Give vitamins A and C in large doses.
• It is good to soak the feet in hot water, with a little mustard and salt added to it.
• Steam inhalations are often very helpful. They can be given every 2-4 hours, according
to the severity of the case.
• Thick slippery elm tea is very good in whooping cough; mix in a little lemon juice and
drink it freely.
• A light diet is essential.
• Keep him isolated from other children.
• If the weather is warm, sunny, and not too damp or dusty, keep him out of doors most of
the day. But he should not exert himself in play.
• Air and sun his bedding every day, if there is sunshine.
• Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death! (See ""Reye's
Syndrome."")
—Also see ""Whooping Cough—2"" and ""Childhood Diseases.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—God is grieved with our griefs. He bends down in sympathy and tender love.
Cry to Him for help, and He will give you that which is for the best.
WHOOPING COUGH—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
INCREASE VITAL RESISTANCE—Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Wet hand Rub 3 times a day.
TO RELIEVE COUGH—Chest and neck Heating Pack, changing every 4 hours; copious drinking of
hot water, especially just before coughing paroxysm. He should drink 3-8 pints of water daily.
HELP KIDNEY ACTION—Neutral Bath daily for a half hour, followed by Cold Mitten Friction to
promote activity of skin and kidneys.
GENERAL METHOD—The disease can not be greatly shortened, but the strength may be maintained,
suffering mitigated, convalescence facilitated, and grave effects prevented by the faithful employment of
the above measures, which should be continued, not only during the active stage of the disease, but for
several weeks after the beginning of convalescence.
—Also see ""Whooping Cough—1.""

(Varicella Zoster, Pox)
SYMPTOMS—Small, round pimples on the face and body, filled with fluid and appearing like water
blisters. As the fluid leaks, it forms a crust.
CAUSES—Chickenpox is a viral disease, which first manifests itself as a fever and headache, 7-21 days
after exposure. The eruptions continue in cycles from 3-7 days, and the disease generally runs its course
in 14 days. It is communicable 1-2 days before the rash develops, until all the blister-like lesions have
crusted (averaging 5-6 days).
Chickenpox mainly occurs between 2 and 8 years of age, and is much more severe if not contracted until
one is an adult. If a pregnant mother has it in the first four months of pregnancy, birth defects are
possible in the infant. Once you have had it, you generally have lifetime immunity. This is why
chickenpox vaccines are dangerous. It is better to get the disease as a child when it is relatively harmless
than to wait till adulthood to contract it.
Oddly enough, the same virus that causes chickenpox in children (varicella zoster) is the one which
causes shingles (which see) in adults.
Chickenpox is transmitted by contact and by airborne droplets. Epidemics tend to occur in the winter
and spring."
disease-general-growing-pains,Growing Pains,"TREATMENT
• Prevention of growing pains includes a solid nutritional program—rich in calcium,
magnesium, selenium, vitamins A, B-complex, E, and C.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Rejoice in the Lord always, and He will give you the courage you need. The
more you praise Him, the more you will have to praise Him for.

SYMPTOMS—Pains in the joints, twitches in the legs, etc.
CAUSES—No, it is not a disease. Growing pains are a part of life in many homes, as the children grow
toward adulthood.
But growing pains are not necessary. If good food and proper vitamin/mineral supplementation are
provided, along with proper rest and an active exercise program, there is no need for ""growing pains"" to
occur."
disease-general-growth-problems,Growth Problems,"TREATMENT
• Be sure and eat a well-balanced nourishing diet. Omit junk foods.
• Adequate amounts of protein are important, especially the amino acid, arginine. Arginine
is used to synthesize ornithine, an amino acid which prompts the pituitary to release its
growth hormone.
• Sources of arginine include coconut, oats, soybeans, walnuts, wheat, wheat germ, carob,
and dairy products.
• Growth hormone therapy can be prescribed by a physician, but it is marvelously
expensive.
• If a child's protein intake is reduced severely, he develops Kwashiorkor (which see), a
protein-deficiency disease. This condition can occur in any nation, not just India.
• Malabsorption disorders, such as celiac disease (which see), can also reduce growth
somewhat.
• Excess amounts of lead, a toxic metal, can produce growth problems.
ENCOURAGEMENT—""The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His
mercy."" Psalm 33:18. He gives His faithful children the help they need.

SYMPTOMS—The child fails to grow properly in height.
CAUSES—The key to growth is the pituitary, the master gland, which is located in the center of the
skull. When it does not function properly, normal growth does not occur.
The pituitary gland produces the growth hormone, somatotropin, and sends it throughout the body, to
stimulate normal enlargement of bones and muscles in children.
Too little production of this hormone will produce dwarfism; too much results in abnormally enlarged
hands, feet, jaw, and possible gigantism.
The pituitary may not be functioning properly because of a tumor growing in, or near, it. But the thymus
gland may not be working properly, and that will affect a child's growth and increase the likelihood of
infection."
disease-general-vaccination-problems,Vaccination Problems,"SYMPTOMS—Physical problems resulting from a vaccination.
DISCUSSION—This is a wide-ranging subject, too large to discuss in detail here. See the author's
book, The Vaccination Crisis, (see order sheet) for detailed discussions of the various vaccines, their
dangers, and how to avoid vaccination requirements.
The underlying problem is simple enough: We normally take substances into our body through our
stomach, where harmful bacteria are generally destroyed.
But a vaccine is injected into a muscle or directly into the bloodstream, thus bypassing the normal
protections. This is highly dangerous!
The problem is that it is impossible to purify the vaccines properly. It would require too much time and
expense to try to examine every microscopic portion, identify every toxin, poison, and microbe, and
eliminate the bad ones. It simply cannot be done.
So monkey pus and horse urine is ""purified"" somewhat, and then injected into your child.
The solution is to live right, eat right, and avoid vaccinations. See the author's book (or a similar
publication) for further information on vaccinations.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God can provide solutions, when earthly trials seem hard to bear. Go to Him
and find in Him the courage and help you so much need.
Section 15
Sexually Transmitted Diseases"
disease-general-venereal-diseases,Venereal Diseases,"TREATMENT
• The only genuine protection is abstinence. Marry a person who never has, and never will
have, sex with another during your lifetime. Then both of you remain faithful to each
other to the end.
• As for condoms, a University of Texas research study proved that 30% of the time they
do not protect against AIDS.
• If you have one of these diseases, see your physician and/or follow the directions for
""Cancer"" in this book.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When all seems dark and unexplainable, we are to trust in God's love. You
need His help. In His strength, you can stand for the right and come off more than conqueror in the
battle against temptation.

(STD)
SYMPTOMS—Blisters around the vagina, burning when urinating, anal pain, itching, pelvic
inflammation, penile discharge, sore throat, flu-like symptoms, and more.
Chlamydia does not always have warning symptoms.
Here is a brief comparative analysis of the symptoms of nine of these STDs:
Chlamydia: In women—a burning sensation when urinating. A white vaginal discharge
resembling cottage cheese. Itching, painful intercourse. In men—a clear, watery, urethral
discharge. But often no symptoms at all.
Genital Herpes: Itching and burning in the genital area. Discomfort when urinating. A
watery vaginal or urethral discharge. Fluid-filled, weeping, eruptions in the vagina or on
the penis.
Genital Warts: Single or clustered, soft, cauliflower-like growths in and around the
vagina, anus, penis, groin, and/or scrotal area.
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): Fever and lower abdominal pain. A pus-filled vaginal
discharge.
Trichomoniasis: In women—a foamy, greenish or yellow, foul-smelling vaginal
discharge, vaginal itching, and pain. In men—a clear urethral discharge.
Syphilis: a sore on the genitals; accompanied by rash, fever, patches of flaking tissue; sore
throat; and sores in the mouth or anus.
Gonorrhea: In women—a cloudy vaginal discharge, frequent and painful urination,
vaginal itching. Inflammation of the pelvic area, rectal discharge, and abnormal uterine
bleeding. In men—a pus-filled, yellowish, discharge. Often there are no symptoms for
months. In women there may never be symptoms, yet all the while they are infecting men.
AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome): Aids has many symptoms; see ""AIDS.""
CAUSES—Venereal diseases are transmitted by intimate contact, when at least one has had more than
one partner. STDs can cause urinary tract problems, sterility in women, and prostatic inflammation in
men.
At the present time, one teenage girl in four has a STD. Some of these diseases can kill newborn babies.
Chlamydia, which often shows little or no symptoms, can cause urinary tract infections and adhesions
which can result in sterility."
disease-general-gonorrhea,Gonorrhea,"TREATMENT
• See your physician. Go on a cleansing program. Drink lots of lemon juice. A entire
changeover to a good diet and way of life is required. Follow the program outlined under
""Cancer.""
• Go to bed as soon as you know you have this disease. Go on a cleansing program of fruit
juices. Take 2 high enemas a day,
• Here is a tea with which you can wash the sores: myrrh, goldenseal root, witch hazel,
chickweed, and sorrel.
• Drink 3 cups of this tea daily: skullcap, hops, white oak bark, uva ursi, sage, poplar, red
root, and juniper; take 2 high enemas each day.
• A tea of red raspberry leaves and witch hazel leaves can be used as a douche for women,
including after each urination.
• A tea of aloes, goldenseal, and myrrh can be washed on sores and ulcers.
• But keep in mind that all this work will be a waste of time if certain other lifestyle
changes are not made.
ENCOURAGEMENT—There is hope for everyone who will seek God's face. He alone can provide for
our needs; He alone can give us the solutions we need.

SYMPTOMS—In women, no symptoms may ever appear. When they do, it may include vaginal
discharge, frequent and painful urination, abnormal menstrual bleeding, acute inflammation in the pelvic
area, and rectal itching. Symptoms generally appear 7-14 days after sexual contact. In men, symptoms
are generally present, including difficult and painful urination, a yellow discharge of pus, and mucous
from the penis. Symptoms appear 2-14 days after contact. The discharge continues 6-8 weeks.
CAUSES—As with syphilis (which see), the effects of gonorrhea keep getting worse. The secondary
stage is difficult to detect and so is often misdiagnosed as arthritis. The gonorrhea is entering the bones,
joints, tendons, and other tissues, causing mild fever, aches, inflamed joints, and sometimes skin lesions.
In men, the outcome can be sterility.
As long as 10 years later, the urethra may narrow or stricture, making urination difficult and at times
impossible. This produces serious inflammation of the bladder. This occurs more often in men than in
women.
Women, who unknowingly contract gonorrhea from their husbands, generally do not know they have the
disease until it is far advanced. The infection can travel up the uterus, into the Fallopian tubes, and out
into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis and possibly death. If that does not occur, then the tubes
may eventually seal off due to the infection, causing sterility and pus pockets which cause pain and
infection."
disease-general-syphilis,Syphilis,"TREATMENT
• See your physician. Go on the treatment outlined under ""Cancer"" in this book.
• Helpful herbs include goldenseal, pau d'arco, echinacea, and suma. But a thorough
cleansing and building program, such as is explained under ""Cancer,"" is needed.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Determine that you will study God's Word every day and obey everything you
read. Let every day begin a new page in your life. Pray earnestly and take every step in the Lord.

SYMPTOMS—A chancre appears on the skin, either on the mouth, in the mouth, or on the genitals. It
is also called a hard chancre or Hunterian sore. This is a red, painless, raised ulcer with hard, well-
defined edges, and appears 10 days to 3 weeks after exposure, and lasts from a few days to several
weeks. In women, it sometimes develops on the cervix and so is not recognized.
Later, a rash and patches of flaking tissue appear in the mouth or genital area. This skin eruption consists
of either a few red, pimply, blemishes or a profuse crop of various types of blotches. By this time, the
disease is well-established throughout the system.
Later stages occur, as the disease worsens. Paralysis, insanity, and death are the final outcome.
CAUSES—Syphilis is caused by the germ, treponema pallidum, which is corkscrew in shape and much
larger than most bacteria. Drying quickly kills the germs, so they must remain wet; they generally enter
the body through a living source—another person (acquired syphilis) or through the placenta to the
unborn child (congenital syphilis). But, in some instances, it has been transmitted to the dentist during
dental work."
disease-general-chlamydia,Chlamydia,"TREATMENT
• This is a complicated disease; see your physician.
• If you wish to supplement such care with natural remedies, you will need to undergo a
thorough natural healing program, such as is detailed in the article on ""Cancer.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—How can we solve the problems we have? Only in Christ can they be resolved.
He can do for you those things you could never do for yourself.

SYMPTOMS—Vaginal or urethral discharge, genital inflammation, difficulty in urinating, itching
around the inflamed area, and painful intercourse.
CAUSES—According to the CDC, more people in America contract Chlamydia than any other sexually
transmitted disease. Over 4 million new cases are diagnosed yearly. Nearly 20% of teenagers in the
United States are known to have contracted it. But these figures do not include the large number that are
not reported. Nearly 10% of men and 70% of women who have chlamydia—have no symptoms. So one
can expect that the total number having, and sharing, this highly contagious disease is vast indeed.
But, whether recognized or not, the effects of chlamydia are serious. About 30% of the women become
sterile and pelvic inflammatory disease and other reproductive problems can, and do, result. In young
women, the disease can also produce a form of arthritis.
In men, prostate infection and seminal vesicle inflammation may occur later. (Symptoms of prostatitis
include pain when urinating and a watery mucous urethral discharge.)
The disease is transmitted through the discharge produced by both men and women. If one spouse is
treated for this, the other one must be also.
To delay treatment is to intensify the effects of the disease."
disease-general-genital-herpes,Genital Herpes,"TREATMENT
• The diet should be alkaline in reaction. Foods to avoid are sweets; refined and processed
foods; alcohol; and, for some people, citrus. Eat only nutritious food.
• The virus lives in red meat and fat, and you do well to stop eating meat products. There
are substances in meat which encourage the growth of Type II.
• DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide), a by-product of wood processing, is a liquid which can be
placed on the affected area to relieve pain and promote healing. Only use the type sold in
health food stores.
• Some physicians prescribe BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) for this disease, but it is
known to cause perforated stomachs.
• Apply black walnut or goldenseal extract to the area. Also useful is cayenne and red
clover, both externally and internally.
• Other helpful herbs include goldenseal, echinacea, myrrh, aloe vera, and burdock.
• Lightly dab tea tree oil on the affected area several times a day, either full strength or
slightly diluted. It is a powerful antiseptic. Do not get it near your eyes.
• Drink only distilled water and get plenty of rest.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus draws near to everyone who is hurting, who needs His help. He can
forgive and fulfill our deepest needs. In Him we can find strength, and peace, and power to overcome.

(Herpes Type II)
SYMPTOMS—Recurrent fluid-filled blisters on the genitals that rupture, leaving red, inflamed, painful
lesions. These are preceded by a slightly irritating tingling. When the lesion appears, it is accompanied
by a sharp pain.
CAUSES—Of the 90 varieties of animal herpes, only four affect humans. Herpes is a virus that causes
recurrent blisters and ulcers (cold sores, also called fever blisters on the lips [Type I] and on the genitals
[Type II]). (See ""Cold Sores"" for information on Type I.) A third type is herpes zoster, which causes
chicken pox and, as a secondary infection, shingles. (See ""Chicken pox"" and ""Shingles."") Type II can
produce blisters either on the genitals or on, or around, the mouth.
We will here deal only with Type II, which is also called herpes genitalis, venereal herpes, and genital
herpes. It is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. One-sixth of all
Americans (about 30 million) have the disease, although about half never develop serious symptoms. A
half million new cases are reported yearly, and 80% are 20 to 39 years of age. The first attack generally
occurs about 4-8 days after initial exposure to a sexual partner. Each occurrence is quite painful and lasts
up to three weeks; but, once a person is infected, the disease can be transmitted at any time. Symptoms
reoccur from every few weeks to once a year or less. Scarring does not usually occur, but can. Outbreaks
rarely occur after the age of 50.
Herpes is a virus which enters the body thorough the skin and travels into nerve groups at the base of the
spine. It remains with you the rest of your lifetime. But it can be dormant for years and then appear
again when the immune system is lowered by poor diet, stress, illness, too much sunlight, or harmful
chemicals.
Type II reoccurs when sexual intercourse takes place, as a result of irritation to the skin. It is not a newly
invaded infection, but one which was received from a sexual partner at an earlier time.
This viral infection can range from a symptomless infection in the nerves to a major inflammation of the
liver, accompanied by fever. In women, it can lead to cervical cancer.
There seems to be a link between having Type II and later developing atherosclerosis.
As a baby passes through an infected birth canal, it can get Type II and possibly have brain damage,
blindness, or death as a result. If an attack occurs late in the pregnancy, the baby should be delivered by
cesarean section. If no lesions are present, the baby is far less likely to become infected as it passes
through the birth canal."
disease-general-aids,Aids,"TREATMENT
• There are definite indications that those who test positive for HIV, yet who take good
care of their immune systems, are less likely to develop full-blown AIDS. Those most
often in this category are individuals who contracted HIV by accident (such as
hemophiliacs) and normally lived healthful, clean, lives. Many of them never develop
AIDS.
• Conduct yourself properly, so you are not likely to contract HIV in the first place.
Maintain an excellent immune system through proper diet, rest, exercise, etc.
• But if you contract HIV, then you need to think through what you need to change in your
life. And then set to work to rebuild your immune system.
• Raw foods, such as fruits and vegetables, especially those high in vitamins A, B
complex, C, and E are very important. Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance. Selenium and
zinc, along with potassium, calcium, and magnesium are also important.
• Garlic, cabbage, kelp, and lots of fresh and cooked greens are important. Eat whole-grain
products.
• Limit your intake of soy products, without fully dropping them.
• Stop eating meat, processed food, and junk food. Banish tobacco, alcohol, and coffee.
Avoid those who smoke.
• Here are herbs which will help rebuild the immune system: echinacea, burdock, garlic,
goldenseal, pau d'arco, psyllium, suma, and ginkgo.
• Also important is black radish, dandelion root, and silymarin (milk thistle extract), to
strengthen the liver. Aloe vera inhibits the growth and spread of HIV. St. John's wort
tends to inhibit retroviral infections.
Certain activities tend to tear down the immune system faster than anything else. Everyone should be
aware of what those activities are:
• Using any form of nicotine.
• Drinking alcohol.
• Using street drugs.
• Taking medicinal drugs.
• Eating primarily junk food.
• Sexual excess, especially non-monogamous sex.
• Overeating and getting little exercise.
• Eating lots of pork, shellfish, and animal fat.
• See your physician and/or follow the instructions for ""Cancer"" in this book.
ENCOURAGEMENT—You have a bright future, if you will give your earthly life to Jesus, just now.
He can forgive your past and empower you, by His grace, to obey His Ten Commandment law.
Everyone in the world needs Him. You can be one of those who find Him.
Section 16
Poisons
Part 1
Bites, Stings

(HIV)
SYMPTOMS—Loss of appetite, weight loss, candida, fatigue, various infections, intestinal problems,
skin diseases, immune system disorders, fevers, brain and neurological disorders, and many other
symptoms.
CAUSES—AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a disease that does not need to happen.
If people controlled themselves, it would never have gotten started, and would eventually die out. But,
instead, it is an exploding epidemic.
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) invades special immune cells in the body, which are called T
lymphocytes, and then slowly multiplies over a long period of time. As it does so, the body's immune
system gradually crumbles. All this time, the disease appears to lay dormant (and only an HIV test will
reveal that a person even has the disease). But, after three to ten years, enough of the body's defenses are
broken down that full-blown AIDS develops. Suddenly, very pronounced symptoms appear, which are
called ""AIDS-related diseases."" These include pneumo-cystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, found in 60% of
those with AIDS), Karposi's sarcoma (a rare type of skin cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; which see),
cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis.
The less deadly AIDS-related diseases are often the first to appear. The first sign is often the tongue
coated with white bumps. This is oral thrush, a type of candida (candidiasis; which see). Intestinal
parasites (which see) and herpes simplex virus (herpes type I) are two other relatively simple infections
which can occur. All indicate that the body's immune system is damaged, although candida, parasites,
herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus, and tuberculosis can occur in those who do not have AIDS.
Most of those who are HIV-positive eventually develop full-blown AIDS. Once that occurs, they
generally live only a few years. The median survival time, after full-blown AIDS appears, is 26 months.
Researchers are searching for an ""AIDS cure""; but the HIV virus changes form so fast, it is unlikely a
cure will ever be found.
Some say the origin of AIDS is unknown, and that the earliest documented case of it appeared in 1981 in
San Francisco. But there may be undocumented cases of it in the 1970s.
Others say that there is a different origin of AIDS. Dr. Eva Snead feels that the virus was created in the
laboratories. She insists that, if you have been vaccinated, you have the virus.
Then there is Dr. William Campbell Douglass, M.D., who, in his book, AIDS the End of Civilization,
maintains that the vaccines were made from the kidney of the green African monkeys, and that the
disease was purposely invented to eliminate certain people.
The disease is transmitted by oral, vaginal, and anal sex; common needles for IV drugs; contaminated
hospital and dental equipment; commercially prepared blood products; and immunotoxic lubricants. In
other words, HIV is transmitted by sex, street drug IVs, blood transfusions, and getting someone else's
blood into your eyes or into cuts on your skin. It is not possible to contract HIV by giving blood."
disease-general-urticaria,Urticaria,"(Nettle Rash)
SYMPTOMS—Small, pale swellings on the skin, with severe itching and burning which come and go,
to be replaced by others. Each lesion lasts a few hours, and is succeeded by new ones in other places.
CAUSES—One cause is contact with the nettle plant, which pricks a poison into the skin. Other causes
include wheat, milk, eggs, chocolate, and other food allergens.
HYDRO—The following formula is from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
Sponging with very hot water, Hot salt or alkaline Sponge, Prolonged Neutral Bath (p. 239).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Pray earnestly for help in all the little things of life, and you will be ready
when great crises come."
disease-general-chiggers,Chiggers,"TREATMENT
• Remove the chigger by scratching off with a fingernail, or apply castor oil or Vaseline.
Another method is to apply clear nail polish to the spot; this smothers the creature.
• A charcoal poultice can be a help.
• Banana is reported to soothe chigger bites.
• Hot baths help control the itching.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Find in the Lord the strength you need every day. The Lord is a great God,
and a great King above all gods. Oh come, let us worship and bow down, and kneel before our Maker.

SYMPTOMS—A red spot that itches intensely for about 3 days.
CAUSES—Chiggers, also called red bugs, are extremely tiny insects in the class (arthropoda, eight-
legged creatures) which includes scorpions, spiders, and mites. They prefer grassy, weedy, fields, but are
also found in wooded areas. They are active from May to September, and especially during June and
July.
Moving slowly, a chigger crawls along until he finds a tight spot in a body crease or where the clothing
is tight. Then, about 2 hours after hitching a ride, he digs in by injecting fluid which dissolves tissue and
produces a welt. About 3-6 hours later the itching begins and continues for about 3 days."
disease-general-itch-mite,Itch Mite,"TREATMENT
• Wash the affected part with tar soap. Wash clothing in boiling water or press them with a
hot iron.
• Steep a tablespoon each of burdock root, yarrow, and yellow dock root in a pint of
boiling water for half an hour. Strain, add a pound of cocoa fat, and keep boiling and
stirring until it is a salve. Use this for an itch of any kind.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Oh how good the Lord is to all of us, and how safely we may trust Him every
day. He calls us His little children. So obey Him in all things, and your happiness can only deepen.

SYMPTOMS—Itching occurs, but seems to travel from place to place on the skin.
CAUSES—Beware of bird nests close to your house! Many birds are infested with mites, and these can
enter your home and get on you."
disease-general-lice,Lice,"TREATMENT
• No drugs are needed to eradicate lice. Instead use one or more of the following methods:
• Heat combs and brushes to 151o F. for 5-10 minutes; soak for an hour in 2% Lysol
solution or freeze for 30 minutes.
• Launder clothing and bedding in hot water. Non-washable items should be sealed in a
plastic sack for 10 days.
• Soak the place on the body for 30 minutes in very warm, soapy, water.
• The hair can be doused in kerosene and then wrapped in a towel. Garlic compresses can
be placed on the scalp for 2 hours. Hot vinegar (or a 50-50 vinegar/water mixture) applied
to the scalp will loosen eggs, so they can be vigorously combed out of the hair with a fine-
toothed comb. A 50-50 mixture of kerosene and olive oil can be put on the scalp to get rid
of the nits.
• Be careful what you place on the eyebrows; you do not want to damage the eyes.
Petroleum jelly has been recommended to suffocate the lice.
• Use, as a hair wash, either labrador tea or field larkspur.
• Vacuuming carpets is as effective as spraying them. Do it frequently.
• Scrub toilet seats regularly.
• Whatever method you use, keep in mind that there is a 14-day cycle; you must work
intensely for a little over 2 weeks on your body, clothing, and home if you are to have
success.
ENCOURAGEMENT—In everything you do, put God and His standards first. You will never be
disappointed if you do this.

(Pediculosis)
SYMPTOMS—Itching of the skin, often on the head, trunk, or pubic area. Lice eggs can be seen on
one's hair. The person will feel like he is overheated or has a slight fever.
CAUSES—There are three types of lice which infect people: the head louse (pediculosis capitis), the
body louse (p. corporis), and the crab louse (p. pubis). Crab lice (also called crabs) are spread by sexual
contact.
Lice can be spread by hanging coats, scarves, and caps together or using someone else's comb, brush,
etc. They live on the clothing (especially in the seams), travel to the skin once a day for a meal, then
back onto the clothing.
Lice live about 30 days, and the female lays about ten eggs a day. The tiny eggs (nits) are laid at the base
of a hair shaft. As the hair grows, the nits are carried upward and can be seen. They look like tiny black
or rust-colored spots at, or near, the base of the hair. They can even be found on the chest, beard, and
eyelashes."
disease-general-typhus,Typhus,"TREATMENT
• Typhus is a tropical disease, and occurs rarely in the northern climates. Call a physician.
If none is available, give the treatment for ""fevers"" and ""Bubonic plague"" (which see).
ENCOURAGEMENT—The end of all things is at hand. Oh that we could see, as we should, the
necessity of seeking the Lord with all the heart! Then we should find Him. May God teach each one of
us how to pray more fervently.

SYMPTOMS—Sudden onset of chills, high fever, prostration, and general pains. The patient is excited,
mentally alert, and has a flushed face and bloodshot eyes.
Delirium frequently occurs early. Small pink spots on neck, chest, abdomen, and limbs appear about the
fifth day. They change from pink to red, then to purple, and finally turn brownish.
Heavy bronchitis, with cough and sputum. Pulse is rapid, but blood pressure is low.
In its early stages, typhus is like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but the home treatment for both is
essentially the same.
CAUSES—There are three main types of typhus fevers (louse fever, flea and tick fever, and mite fever),
but they are all treated about the same and are caused by similar bacteria carried by lice, fleas, ticks, or
mites.
Typhus occurs where people are crowded together under unsanitary conditions.
But Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease are more easily acquired by anyone who goes out
into the woods.
—See ""Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever"" and ""Lyme Disease"" for related information."
disease-general-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever,Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,"TREATMENT
• Call a physician; auxiliary home treatment would be for ""fevers"" and ""Bubonic Plague.""
For preventative measures, see ""Lyme Disease.""
• If a tick is biting you, pull it off slowly so as not to leave part behind; then rub on a little
alcohol, vinegar, or lemon.
PREVENTION—Before going on a walk in the woods or fields, mix 50-50 powdered sulphur and
talcum powder, and dust it on your legs and around your waist. An old-timer suggests putting a little
turpentine around your ankles and one drop on your tongue, to discourage them.
Avoid sleeping where cattle graze or near your dog.
—Also see ""Lyme Disease.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We can safely trust in God, to help us through the trials and disappointments
of life. Go to Him and find in Him the help you so much need. He will give that which is best.

(Tick fever)
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms begin 7-12 days after being bitten: headaches, chills, weakness, fever,
muscle pain, and dry cough. There is a skin rash on the wrists, ankles, palms, soles of the foot and
forearms; this then spreads to the neck, face, axilla, buttocks, and trunk.
Next comes liver enlargement and pneumonitis. If untreated, circulatory failure brings death.
CAUSES—When symptoms first appear, do not wait for a positive blood test identification before
instituting treatment. Death may occur as soon as 4-10 days after appearance of symptoms. Contact a
physician.
Spotted fever is caused by a similar bacteria (rickettsia) that causes typhus (which see), but spotted fever
is transmitted by a tick. Of the reported cases, 90% occur along the eastern seaboard and 10% in the
Rocky Mountains. But it can be contracted anywhere in between those regions.
May through October is when people, who are out in the woods, are especially bitten. You can also get it
from your dog, which has been roaming the woods and picking up ticks as though he were a vacuum
cleaner."
disease-general-lyme-disease,Lyme Disease,"TREATMENT
• The longer the tick is attached, the greater the risk of Lyme disease.
• Remove the tick with tweezers. Put the tweezers close to the skin and slowly pull
straight out. Do not twist. You want the entire tick out, without leaving part of it in the
skin or injecting bacteria from its broken body into the skin. You may pour rubbing
alcohol on the tick before pulling him out. Do not touch the tick with your hands. Do not
apply kerosene, turpentine, or petroleum jelly.
• Wash your hands and the bite area. Apply rubbing alcohol to the bite area. Do not use a
match to get the tick out.
• Save the tick in a jar. Call a physician if you want it tested immediately. Watch for
symptoms over the next 3 weeks.
• Put suspicious clothing in the dryer for 30 minutes, to kill ticks by dehydration. Washing
clothes, even in hot water and bleach, does not necessarily kill ticks.
• Heat relieves pain. Hot baths are helpful. See ""Fevers.""
PREVENTION—The best solution to this problem is prevention. Avoid going out in the woods in the
summer months, when ticks are the most active (especially June to August). Stay on the center of the
trails. Check yourself and your children carefully afterward.
Wear long pants and tuck them into your socks. Wear a long-sleeved shirt with a high neck or scarf, plus
hat or gloves. If the clothing is light-colored, you can see the ticks better.
You may choose to use an insect repellent containing deet (diethyl toluamide). It lasts longer than
others, and is said to be safe on the outside. But it is deadly if taken into your body, and dissolves
plastics and synthetics.
Not everyone bitten acquires the disease. A high sugar and fat diet attracts insects! The skin eliminates
toxins, which attract bugs when the diet is unnatural.
When the blood is pure and the body clean, there is far less likelihood of tick bites and lice infestation.
A diet high in fiber and natural food will help keep the body clean and protect against infections. Sugar
attracts insects.
Herbs useful in preventing infections include: echinacea, goldenseal, garlic, and burdock. Rubbing with
lemon juice will disinfect the area. Aloe vera on the area will aid in healing.
Vitamins A and C protect against infections. B complex vitamins help keep the blood clean. Eat lots of
greens.
A test is now available, but false positives occur sometimes. So, if you are being treated for Lyme
disease and are not getting better, consider having a second test made. One study of nearly 800 people,
diagnosed with Lyme disease, revealed that half of them did not have it! Physicians blame false-positive
tests for this.

ENCOURAGEMENT—If, through surrender and prayer, you are in Christ, as the trials come, the
power of God will come with them. You will receive exactly that which is best at this time.

SYMPTOMS—Between 2 and 32 days after the bite, symptoms appear: fatigue, flu-like symptoms,
stiff neck, backache, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
Ultimately, enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen may occur, along with irregular heart rhythm,
arthritis, and brain damage.
Some of these symptoms slowly pass away over 2-3 years. But sometimes symptoms recur later without
having been bitten again.
Because this disease is now so prominent, and because it can occur so mysteriously, here are more
detailed symptoms on its usual 3 stages (which not everyone goes through):
1 - Small raised bumps (and/or a rash) appear on the entire body for 1-2 days or several
weeks and then fades. Fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.
2 - Weeks or months later, facial paralysis may occur. Frequently, enlargement of the
spleen and lymph glands occurs and/or severe headaches, enlargement of the heart
muscle, and abnormal heart rhythm.
3 - This can develop into backache, stiff neck, joint pains in the knees, swelling and pain
in other joints, and even degenerative muscle and joint disease.
Physicians especially look for these symptoms, before treating with antibiotics: a small red bump at the
site of the tick bite; a bull's-eye rash surrounding it; and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, chills, and
joint pain. If treatment is postponed until more advanced symptoms develop (heart, brain, or joint
problems), drug medications do not work as well.
CAUSES—The bite of a tiny tick (Ixodes dammini) is primarily carried by deer; but it is also carried, in
the eastern states, by white-footed field mice and, in the west, by lizards and jackrabbits. In California it
is also transmitted by the black-legged tick, carried by wood rats.
Both deer ticks and black-legged ticks are very tiny: An adult is less than 1/10th of an inch, and the
nymph is a pinhead in size. They are much smaller than a dog tick.
Lyme disease most frequently occurs where the white-tailed deer is most abundant, which is the
northeastern states. Eight states report 90% of the cases: Connecticut, Massachusetts, California,
Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. But it has occurred in every state
except Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana, and Nebraska. The disease was first identified in the mid-
1970s in Lyme, Connecticut.
Dogs and cats can collect these special ticks out in the woods and bring them into your home.
Tick bites are generally painless and unnoticed; so the symptoms may not at first, or later, be correctly
diagnosed. But in advanced stages, when correct diagnosis finally occurs, the situation may have
become critical.
The symptoms are similar to those of multiple sclerosis, gout, and Epstein-Barr virus (chronic fatigue
syndrome), all three of which see.
A test now exists which can detect the bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) which causes Lyme disease.
Antibodies are present from 3 days to 3 weeks after infection.
The majority of cases occur in the summer and fall. After a tick bites, it waits several hours before it
begins to feed on the host's blood; and, once it does, it feasts for 3-4 days. The longer the tick remains
attached, the greater the risk of Lyme disease.
Lyme disease is treatable and almost always curable if correctly diagnosed in the early stages. But,
because the bites are usually painless, the incubation period so long, and the symptoms so varied, the
problem may go unrecognized for weeks or months.
If you develop a bull's-eye type of rash anywhere on your body, see your health-care provider right
away."
disease-general-bubonic-plague,Bubonic Plague,"TREATMENT
• Call a physician. Living cleanly and eating right is the best prevention. Healthy, rested,
people can resist infection better than others.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All our sufferings and sorrows, all our temptations and trials, all our sadness
and griefs; in short, all things—work together for good to them that love God and are called according to
His purpose.

(The Plague)
SYMPTOMS—Following an incubation period of 2-10 days, the disease begins suddenly with a high
fever, severe headache, great weakness, and pains in the back and limbs. There may be vomiting and
diarrhea.
The fever may go up to 104o F. the first day, accompanied by intense thirst.
Buboes (swollen places) begin to appear the second day in the groin, under the arms, and in the neck.
The disease causes great weakness, and death often occurs sometime between the third and sixth day.
CAUSES—In the bubonic form of the plague, the lymph glands swell; when swollen, they are called
""buboes.""
This is a disease carried by the Norway rat. The bacteria are in its droppings, which it leaves in the food
stuffs it has broken into and partly eaten.
In earlier centuries, several outbreaks of the plague occurred; during one of which one-sixth of the
people of Europe died.
There is also a pneumonic form of the plague, which is far less common. The symptoms are about the
same as pneumonia, but it is transmitted through the air and is extremely contagious.
The plague essentially never occurs in the Western world today. We mention it here so you will be
aware of the symptoms."
disease-general-rabies,Rabies,"(Hydrophobia)
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms begin appearing within 1-4 months after the bite, but sometimes longer.
They include numbness, soreness, and tingling where the bite occurred.
These sensations spread, and it becomes difficult to swallow, breathe, and talk.
Then more extensive muscle spasms begin, and the victim gradually becomes maniacal. The final stages
are depression, exhaustion and sometimes paralysis, coma, and death.
If the symptoms of rabies have already begun to appear, the person will probably die.
See end of this article for symptoms in a rabid dog. Rabies can also be transmitted by the bite of infected
bats, foxes, skunks, and other animals.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• A backwoodsy nature doctor, who has treated all kinds of things with remarkable
success, says to do this: Wash the wound with water right away and then mix with half
and half vinegar and warm water, and wash the wounds with it. When dry, apply 1-2
drops of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) to each wound. Do this even if, what appears to
be, a rabid dog only licks a previous wound on you.
• For extra precaution, you may apply a tourniquet and a rubber vacuum cup as for a snake
bite (which see for further details). If acid is not available, you may burn the wound with a
magnifying glass in the sunlight. Or use a red-hot iron. Then treat as for a regular burn
until it is healed. This treatment usually prevents further worry. So says this
backwoodsman.
• Jethro Kloss has a lengthy article on this in his book, Back to Eden (pp. 490-495) (see
order sheet). He also says to put hydrochloric acid on the wound, to neutralize the rabies
poison in the saliva. Then, after discussing a number of herbal remedies to also use, he
quotes a scientific paper by an M. Buisson, read to the French Academy of Arts and
Sciences. M. Buisson had accidentally contracted rabies from a women suffering with it.
By the time he discovered he had it, the disease was advanced and he knew he was soon to
die. Kloss quotes a London newspaper which reported on the scientific paper:
""Concluding from these various symptoms that he was suffering with
hydrophobia, he [Buisson] resolved to make an end of himself by
suffocating himself in a vapor [steam] bath. With this view, he raised the
heat very, very, hot, but was delighted, no less than surprised, to find that all
his pains disappeared. He went out of the bath completely cured, ate a
hearty dinner, and drank more freely than was usual with him. He adds that
he has treated more than fourscore persons who have been bitten by mad
dogs in a similar manner, and they all recovered, with the exception of a
child seven years old, who died in a vapour bath he was
administering.""—Kloss, Back to Eden, p. 493.
• Water therapists normally work with a steam bath temperature of 115o-120o F. (See our
Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet) for detailed information on steam baths, pp. 131-
138.) Those with diabetes, valvular heart disease, extreme arteriosclerosis, or emaciation
should not use a steam bath.
Kloss also quotes a German newspaper which discussed an incident which happened in Saxony:
• ""A Saxon forester named Gastell, at the age of 82, unwilling to take to the grave with
him a secret of so much importance, has made public in the Leipsic Journal the method
which he used for fifty years, and he affirms he has rescued many human beings and cattle
from the fearful death of hydrophobia. Wash the wound immediately with warm water
and vinegar; let it dry, and then pour upon the wound a few drops of hydrochloric acid,
and that will neutralize and destroy the poison of the saliva.""—Op. cit., p. 494.
We included the above as a matter of historical interest. Now we return to modern physiologic and
medical theory on rabies:
• Nearly all human rabies cases result from dog bites. The animal can transmit disease
before it shows symptoms of rabies; but, except in rare instances, the symptoms will
appear within 10 days if it is rabid. The disease is always fatal, unless it is halted by a
series of Pasteur treatments, which are started before symptoms first appear.
• If at all possible, it is crucial to confine the animal which inflicted the bite so it can be
observed. The course of the disease runs so fast that the animal should show symptoms of
rabies before they begin to appear in the person. If the animal is rabid, it will show clear
signs within 2 weeks, then the person bitten should begin the Pasteur series of rabies shots
(unless circumstances are clear that the animal was not rabid).
• If the animal got away and cannot be found, then the person should immediately take the
rabies vaccine series.
• If the series has already been started, and the animal is then found not to have rabies, the
Pasteur treatments can be stopped.
• About 10%-12% of persons bitten by a known rabid animal, and not treated, will
contract rabies and die. If the Pasteur series is started within 2 weeks or less after the bite,
about one-third of 1% of those bitten will die.
• It is not widely known that rabies is sometimes transmitted accidentally in hospitals.
Rabies in humans is sometimes misdiagnosed as a stroke. After death, some of that rabid
tissue may be transplanted to another person.
• If your child's pet hamster bites him, do not think the child needs to start rabies shots.
Know that, if you have had that hamster for 3 weeks or more and it shows no symptoms of
rabies, the hamster does not have rabies.
• Rabies shots last 10 days and are so difficult to take that the person often goes to the
hospital for respiratory support while they are in progress.
SYMPTOMS IN THE DOG—Initially, there is a marked change in its disposition. He will become
very friendly or very snappy; the bark becomes hoarse.
Paralysis may soon develop—first the lower jaw, then the hind legs, and gradually the rest of the body.
But, instead, the dog wants to run away. It may run for miles, snapping at any creature which comes near
it.
Finally, it becomes exhausted and paralysis sets in.
If a dog shows signs of rabies, it must be chained (not roped), and observed for 2 weeks.
—Also see ""Dog or Animal Bite"" and ""Antispasmodic Tincture.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus encourages you to persevere in prayer. In Him you can find the help you
need for the crisis you face."
disease-general-tularemia,Tularemia,"(Rabbit fever)
SYMPTOMS—The first indication is a local ulceration at the infection site. About 1-7 days after
infection occurs, chills, headache, prostration, and general pains suddenly begin. The disease is
characterized by high fever and recurring chills with drenching sweat. A shallow but ongoing ulcer
develops at the site of the original wound or bite. Lymph glands draining that area become swollen and
painful (but they should not be lanced!).
If not treated, the fever generally lasts 3-4 weeks, and generally is not fatal. But convalescence is slow.
Physical and mental depression can last for months.
CAUSES—One cause is the bite of an animal, generally a rabbit. A more frequent cause today (87%) is
cutting oneself while skinning and dressing infected rabbits or ground squirrels. Often these are wild
rabbits.
If you notice the appearance of symptoms—and you have been working with rabbits, especially wild
ones—then have the condition immediately diagnosed. Sputum samples are highly contagious, so the lab
should be warned about your suspicions.
TREATMENT—Go to a physician.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We yearn for a deeper, broader, sense of God's presence. As we seek for it, we
find the strength, peace, and encouragement we need. God will help you."
disease-general-cat-coccidia,Cat Coccidia,"TREATMENT
• See a physician. Diagnosis is made from a positive blood test or skin test.
PREVENTION—Women should avoid cats just prior to, and during, pregnancy. They should only eat
well-cooked meat. Better yet, stop eating it entirely, since many diseases are transmitted through eating
meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish.
ENCOURAGEMENT—You can trust God to do for you that which you cannot do for yourself. In Him
is our strength and help. In Him we find the answers we need to life's problems.

Allergies

(Toxoplasmosis)
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms can mimic the flu, cause headache, high fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes,
meningitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, blindness, and diarrhea.
If a pregnant woman contracts this disease, it will cause birth defects in the fetus (brain defects,
blindness, and/or mental retardation).
CAUSES—Those who keep cats should be aware of this danger. Cat coccidia is caused by a tiny
protozoa (Isospora bigemina) which lives in the intestines of cats. Apparently, it is in many cats!
This disease is acquired by inhaling or swallowing dust from contaminated kitty litter boxes or outdoor
sand or dirt piles. But it can also come from eating rare beef. While that protozoa is in an intermediate
stage, it is outside the cat's intestines—and can enter the human body."
disease-general-allergies,Allergies,"TREATMENT
• Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance (the amount you can take before diarrhea results from
the acidity in the C).
• Take vitamin A and zinc, and be sure and get enough essential fatty acids and vitamin B
complex.
• Eat a balanced, moderate, nutritious diet and drink enough water—and you will find that
many things in your life will improve.
• Try a fruit and vegetable juice fast for 1-3 days. If you are not thin, repeat it every
month.
• Here is a good liver flush to take during the fast: 1 teaspoon of olive oil, one-half
teaspoon of fresh ginger, 1 teaspoon of fenugreek, 1 teaspoon of ground dandelion, the
juice of 1 fresh lemon, and a pinch of cayenne. Mix it in juice and drink every morning
during the fast.
• Building up the body and avoiding the offensive substances is what you want. Regarding
the second, what should you avoid? The simplest solution is to do a pulse test. Include one
test item in each meal; take your pulse after each meal, and see if that item raised your
pulse a little. Some people are disturbed each time they ride in a car. Keep searching for
causes.
Here are other ways to have avoidance:
• Vacuum the house and car more often. Air-condition the house and car. Install an air
cleaner in your bedroom or get one which connects to your central air conditioner. Buy a
dehumidifier.
• Wrap your bedding in plastic. Use a synthetic pillow or none at all. Wash mattress pads
more often.
• Get rid of the old carpets, clean the floors, and either install new carpets or stop using
them. Use throw rugs instead.
• Clean damp areas in your home, such as under the sink and around the bathtub.
• If you have animals in the house, keep them clean, well groomed and healthy.
Frequently change cages or wash their bedding. Animals are not involved in allergy as
frequently as people think. They seem to be the 'allergy scapegoats'.
If you have absolute unmistakable evidence that a pet is the source of an allergy, try
bathing it and keeping it well groomed. If this fails, be sure to find a good home for the
pet. It is a living thing also and its needs should be respected. As a child with asthma I
several times suffered having my pets taken from me when I would go to certain 'allergy
specialists'- it never helped my asthma- and it sure didn't help my emotional
development! (temcat edit)
• Set aside one room which you keep air-filtered.
—Also see ""Hay Fever."" Important, also see ""How to Do the Pulse Test,"" immediately below. It explains
how to identify food allergies.
ENCOURAGEMENT—How sweet it is to trust in God! How encouraging it is to find in Him the
guidance we need for daily life. As you seek Him in prayer, He will bring you the deep peace your heart
so craves.
# PULSE TEST, HOW TO DO
WHAT IT IS—The Pulse Test is mentioned in this book occasionally. It was devised by Arthur Coca,
M.D., and is discussed in detail in his book, The Pulse Test. It is a simple home method, to determine
which foods you are allergic to.
HOW TO DO THE PULSE TEST—Identifying specific food allergens can improve your health. Each
test is simple enough, but they must be continued over a period of time.
First, how do you take your pulse? Place your finger on an artery somewhere on your body that you can
easily feel. Nurses check the pulse at the inside of the wrist. The author has found that it is much easier
to check it on the upper front side of his neck, at the carotid artery. Have a stopwatch in your other hand
and time the beats for one minute.
To perform this test, you take your pulse. This is called your basal pulse or base pulse rate.
Then you eat a single food, and check your pulse rate in 15, 30, and 60 minutes afterward.
An elevation in pulse rate of more than ten beats; that is, it beats more than 10 beats faster per minute
than your base pulse. This means that you are allergic to that food.
A problem is that you may wish to eat more than one food at a time. You can take your base pulse, then
sit down and eat your entire meal and keep checking your pulse 15, 30, and 60 minutes after you
finished. In this way you will obtain an inkling that everything was all right at that meal or that
something was wrong. Gradually, over a period of time, you can narrow it down, and then work on
specific foods. Eating only one at a time and checking your pulse on those.
OTHER TESTS—Here are several other tests:
The Elimination Diet: Eliminate certain foods from your meal for several days, and see how it affects
your pulse. This is a good pattern to use in connection with the Pulse Test.
Food Rotation Diets: This is said to be a good method. Grains, proteins, and other suspected foods are
arranged in the diet so that their consumption is not repeated more frequently than every 4-5 days. This
helps you figure things out a little more quickly with your pulse test.
The Fast Test: Fast for five days and then add individual foods and test each one with your pulse. This is
far more accurate, but who wants to eat like a mouse all that time? The theory behind this method is that
many reactions take 5 days to settle down and another 3-5 days to begin again. But following that
theory, you will not be eating much for a good long time.
Skin Patch Test: This is something you can buy at your drugstore. Perhaps it will tell you something.
The Diet Diary: This method helps when offending foods seem to afterward bother you emotionally,
give you headaches, etc. You keep an ongoing meal diary, at which you note what you ate, and
afterward write down how it affected you. Within minutes or hours after eating an offending food, there
may be indications of problems.
The RAST Test—This test costs about $15 per food item, and you may want to use it, after narrowing the
range with the other tests. The Radioallergiabsorbent Test (RAST Test) identifies specific antibodies in
the blood to certain foods or other substances. Usually common allergenic foods, such as wheat, milk,
eggs, yeast, and citrus are tested. But any food can be a problem. Most good laboratories do RAST tests.
However, because it is extremely selective (only showing up positive Ige-mediated allergies), many
false-negative reactions occur.
The Cytotoxic Allergy Test: This test exposes some of your white blood cells to a fraction of the
suspected food or substance. A battery of 38 to 40 tests of common foods are routinely tested for only
$80 to $90, so it is less expensive and more convenient than RAST. Even inhalants, food dyes, or other
chemicals can be tested! But the test is only done at large medical centers; and, again, many false-
positives occur. Some experts question the reliability of this test, since human interpretation is required
to analyze the results.
Unfortunately, results of RAST and the cytotoxic tests rarely agree. (It is said that each test locates
different ""systems"" of allergies.) Frankly, it seems that you would do best just checking your pulse at
home, and saving the money.
Once you have identified specific allergenic foods, you then eliminate them from your diet.
—See ""Allergies"" and ""Hay Fever.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—What must it be like to be close to God? It is a little heaven on earth, to go to
heaven in. Yet, by daily surrender and prayer, we can each have this experience. Through the enabling
strength of Christ obey His Ten Commandment law, and you will fulfill His plan for your earthly life.

SYMPTOMS—Digestive (after eating) symptoms: Dry mouth, food intolerance, stomach ulcers, canker
sores, excessive tiredness, palpitations, swelled stomach, sweating, mental fuzziness, stinging tongue,
metallic taste, heartburn, indigestion, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, food cravings, pains,
intestinal gas, gall bladder trouble.
Muscular and skeletal symptoms: Arthritis; aches in neck, back, or shoulders; fatigue; spasms; joint
pain.
Respiratory and throat symptoms: Cough, asthma, frequent colds, postnasal drip, wheezing, hay fever,
nosebleeds, chest tightness, hoarseness, shortness of breath, dry or sore throat.
Nervous symptoms: Tachycardia (fast heart rate), palpitations, depression, anger, anxiety, confusion,
irritability, hyperactivity, restlessness, learning and memory problems.
Skin symptoms: Blotches, acne, flushing, hives, dark circles under eyes, itching, eczema, psoriasis.
CAUSES—An allergy is a sensitivity to some particular substance, known as an allergen. It may be
harmless to some while causing problems for others. The allergen may be a food, inhalant, or chemical.
It may be smoke, molds, pollen, perfume, formalin, etc.
Causes vary widely: There can be urticaria (skin rash with itching) from fish or strawberries; paranoia
from sugar; headaches from perfume; or asthma-like symptoms from sulfite (a preservative in sulphured
raisins and apricots). The list goes on and on.
Mold is a special problem. It can be in the house, in the food, in the drugs (that is what the penicillin-
type drugs are: mold!). Avoid dampness in, or around, your home.
It is estimated that 35 million Americans, alone, have some type of allergy.
Unfortunately, we live in the chemical age. The body cannot handle all the problem substances entering
it, and it rebels."
disease-general-hay-fever,Hay Fever,"TREATMENT
• The most effective treatment is to avoid the irritant.
• Vitamin C in large doses of 200 mg or more daily greatly helps many with this problem.
• Vitamin A is essential for proper functioning of the respiratory system. The B complex
(especially B and B ) help the body produce interferon, to protect the body against
6 12
allergens.
• Calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, and zinc are also important.
• Be sure and eat green leafy vegetables. Stay on a high-fiber diet.
• Try eating unprocessed, raw, honey. It is rich in pollen.
• Water helps flush out the system. Be sure you are drinking enough.
• Because it firms up blood vessels throughout the body, exercise decreases nasal
stuffiness.
• A hot footbath helps relieve nasal congestion.
• Consider these possibilities: Cold cloths wrung from ice water applied to the forehead
greatly help. Change as soon as they warm up. Relief comes in about 45 minutes, but
continue it for 3 hours. Then intermittently for 6 hours. In some, this treatment has
stopped attacks for the season.
• Build up the immune system, and clean the blood and colon. Healthy sinuses have moist
mucous membranes similar to the skin in the mouth. They are able to wash pollen and
other irritants out of the nasal cavities and down the throat into the stomach, where they
are neutralized.
• Guard against chilling. It constricts blood vessels in the skin, driving blood
elsewhere—including the nasal cavities. This causes a swelling in the sinuses, which
makes the symptoms worse.
• Fenugreek helps eliminate hard mucous from the body. Garlic kills bacteria. Goldenseal
helps clear out toxins from the digestive tract.
• Cover mattress and pillows with plastic. Avoid wool bedding or furniture stuffed with
horsehair.
• If you have animals in the house, keep them clean, well groomed and healthy.
Frequently change cages or wash their bedding. (temcat edit)
—Also see ""Allergies"" and ""Asthma.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Amid the problems to which all are exposed, we need help from God. As we
come to Him, believing, we can receive all the help we need. Trust Him ever; He will never forsake you,
except by your choice.

(Allergic Rhinitis)
SYMPTOMS—Itching in the nose, throat, and eyes. Runny or stuffy nose, headaches, pain in the head
and sinuses, blurred vision, red and itchy eyes, postnasal drip. A clear, watery, discharge from the nose
and eyes occurs. There is sneezing and nervous irritability.
CAUSES—Hay fever is most frequently caused by breathing in plant pollens. (Ragweed and grass
pollen are the worst offenders.) The problem tends to be seasonal (spring or fall), according to plant
cycles. But some may have to suffer with it all year long if they are sensitive to dust, feathers, or animal
danders. Such people are said to have perennial allergic rhinitis.
Hay fever is a reaction of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and air passages to such seasonal
pollens, as well as to dust, feathers, animal hair, and other irritants.
Dry, windy, days; riding in an open car; and working in the garden sometimes increase symptoms.
Morning and evening hours are the most uncomfortable. Midday may be better.
Stressful situations and alcoholic beverages can trigger an attack.
Anger, resentment, or negative thoughts can increase the symptoms.
Hay fever sufferers frequently also have asthma and dermatitis.
The body is trying to clean out toxins and dust. If the diet is not nutritious; if the person is eating too
much or eating foods, such as milk, ice cream, sugar, and white-flour products, the overloaded system
cannot deal properly with the additional task of resisting the effects of airborne pollens."
disease-general-food-poisoning,Food Poisoning,"TREATMENT
• As soon as you believe you have food poisoning, take a eyedropperful of alcohol-free
goldenseal extract every 4 hours for 24 hours. This natural antibiotic will destroy bacteria
in the intestinal tract. (But never take goldenseal for more than a week at a time, during
pregnancy, or if you are allergic to ragweed.)
• Take 6 charcoal tablets immediately, and again in 6 hours. They will help neutralize
poisons in your bloodstream. Drink lots of good water (distilled is best).
• Telephone your regional Poison Control Center. There is a different phone number for
each state. Dial the operator (0) or emergency (911) and ask for that number in your state.
• Use enemas to clean out the colon.
• Someone should help the one vomiting, so he does not choke. If he does not stop
vomiting within 24 hours, collect samples for analysis, to identify the poison.
• Sometimes it is best to induce vomiting. Lobelia will help or drinking water and putting
a finger down the throat.
• If food poisoning may have occurred in a restaurant or roadhouse, contact the health
department.
• If the condition continues, contact a physician.
• Research at the University of Wolverhamptom, in Britain, disclosed that all types of
disease-producing intestinal bacteria died when garlic was present.
• A severe headache and vomiting soon after a meal may be caused by food allergies,
which see. Charcoal tablets will help solve that problem.
PREVENTION—It is best to stop eating meat and dairy products or, if you do, be sure they are most
thoroughly cooked. Check home-canned jars carefully before opening them. Beware of restaurants,
roadhouses, and salad bars. When eating out, you eat at your own risk. To help protect you, eat 2 garlic
tablets before you eat anything else. Better yet, pack bag lunches and learn to buy what you need at a
grocery store.
Refrigerate food you buy as soon as you can. Keep perishables refrigerated. Keep food hot or cold; food
left at room temperature encourages bacterial growth. Keep the refrigerator set at 40o F. or below, and
the freezer set at 0o F. or below.
Meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood are especially dangerous. They must be cooked thoroughly and hands
washed; all utensils touching the raw materials must be sterilized. Do not use recipes calling for raw
eggs which will remain raw or be inadequately cooked. Do not leave mayonnaises, salad dressings, and
milk products sitting out at room temperature. Be especially careful at picnics.
Wash kitchen towels and sponges daily with a 1-20 bleach and water solution.
Do not use bulging cans or products with loose lids or cracked jars! Rusted, sticky, or bent cans should
be discarded. Wash lunch boxes and Thermos bottles after each use.
Thaw all frozen foods in the refrigerator.
When reheating food, bring it to a quick boil, and cook it for a minimum of 4 minutes.
Do not give honey to a young baby below the age of one. Fed by the honey, botulism spores will grow in
the infant's intestine, producing botulism toxin.
ENCOURAGEMENT—By firm adherence to the right, through the grace of Christ, each one of us can
fulfill God's plan for our lives. Go to Him in prayer and find the answers you need.

SYMPTOMS—Pain, vomiting, cramping, weakness, diarrhea, dizziness.
Symptoms occur quickly, 1-4 hours after eating the contaminated substance. They can last for a few
hours or a few days.
Salmonella symptoms: pain, vomiting, and diarrhea can require several days to appear.
Staphylococcus aureus symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting 2-6 hours after the meal. It is good to
induce vomiting, to help rid the system of toxins.
Botulism symptoms: 12-48 hours after ingestion, symptoms appear. Extreme weakness, double vision,
swallowing difficulty. Paralysis and death can follow.
Giardia symptoms: Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, flatulence, and
vomiting.
CAUSES—Eating food containing harmful bacteria causes food poisoning. Each year more than 2
million Americans report food poisoning. Of course, the actual number is far higher. Unfortunately, we
live in a poisoned age. About 2 million Americans report food poisoning each year; of that number,
9,000 people die each year. A far greater number have food poisoning, who think it is the flu.
A full 90% of botulism cases in the United States are caused by improper home canning. The safest
method is to cook the jarred food in a pressure cooker rather than in a tub on top of the stove.
Two-thirds of all food poisoning cases were related to the use of poorly cooked eggs.
The types of bacteria in food which cause disease (pathogenic) or produce toxins (toxigenic) cannot be
seen, tasted, or smelled in the food.
Here are the most common of these food poisoning organisms:
Salmonella (Salmonellosis): This is the most common cause of food poisoning. It has especially
increased since antibiotics began being placed in animal feeds, to prevent disease in crowded,
unsanitary, conditions and help them grow faster. (More than 50% of cattle, poultry, and swine are now
given antibiotics.) But, doing this, promoted the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal
intestines. A third of all chickens in America have salmonella.
Salmonella is easily transmitted on hands, food supplies, knives, table tops, cracked eggs, partly raw
food, etc. Mechanical methods of evisceration in slaughterhouses also spread salmonella to all the other
birds being slaughtered. Cooks that handle raw meat or eggs, and then handle other food—especially
raw food, such as salads—endanger many people. Vegetarians should wash their hands with soap,
immediately after handling raw egg shells. Cook eggs well. (Beware of mayonnaise; it contains raw
eggs.) Milk and ice cream can also be contaminated with salmonella. In 1985, 17,000 people in the
northeast became ill from contaminated milk.
Outbreaks of salmonella poisoning primarily occur in the warmer months. Symptoms range from mild
abdominal pain to severe diarrhea, and even typhoid-like fever. This disease can so weaken the immune
system that the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels are damaged. Arthritis can result.
Eating raw or poorly cooked chicken, eggs, beef, and pork products is the main way salmonella is eaten.
But it can also be found in clams and oysters.
Of 35 food poisoning outbreaks reported between 1985 to 1987, 24 were caused by contaminated eggs,
or foods containing them. Boil eggs for at least 25 minutes.
We will briefly note some other sources of food-borne illness:
Staphylococcus aureus: This is said to be the second-largest source of food poisoning (25%). This can
be transmitted by coughing and sneezing on food.
Clostridium botulinum: This is old-fashioned botulism. Many restaurants and roadhouses leave food
setting out at room temperature for hours. This can also be found in old mustard and other sauce jars.
Although easily destroyed by cold or heat, botulism is the most deadly of all the food-borne diseases. It
produces toxins which block nerve impulses to the muscles.
Heating food to 176o F. for 20 minutes or 194o F. for 10 minutes destroys the spores. Home-canned
food, not properly cooked, can be dangerous. Never use contents of a bulging can or a rusty can! It is
found in canned vegetables, meats, fish, mushrooms, and soups.
Giardia (giardiasis): This is found in drinking water from lakes and streams. It is not destroyed by water
treatment, including chlorination. It can also be found in raw food which has grown in contaminated
water. Giardia grows best where it is cool and damp.
Four other sources of food poisoning should be mentioned: Staphylococcus, complobacter jejuini,
campylobacteriosis, and clostridium perfringens.
Each of these comes primarily from eating meat, and sometimes dairy products.
Before concluding, keep in mind trichinae (trichinella), which is found in pork. Also beware of mold
found on food; it can produce poisonous toxins. Do not eat potato sprouts; they have concentrated
solanine which can cause hallucinations even after recovery."
disease-general-poison-ivy,Poison Ivy,"TREATMENT
• If the possibility exists that you may have touched it, wash your hands as soon as
possible. Carefully wash downward, so the water drips down off your hands rather than up
your arms. Wash with soap and water; rinse in running water; wash again with soap and
water. Do this several times in order to get the toxic oils off your skin. Then dry and see
what happens.
• As soon as you touch the plant, try to wash the skin with water, even if no soap is
available. The water tends to carry off the oil. If nothing else is available, in an emergency
apply paint thinner, ammonia, or acetone to carry off the oils.
• Yellow laundry soap is best for this purpose. You want a strong cleansing soap which
cuts oil and carries it away. An alkaline laundry soap or detergent is the best.
• In washing the skin, never use a washcloth; it only moves the toxic oil around.
• Wash clothing and gear in soapy water.
• Those slightly sensitive to the plant can simply avoid touching or scratching the pimples,
and the itching will be only slightly noticed. If they wish, they can briefly apply
compresses of hot, plain, water to the area.
• Those strongly sensitive may wish to consult a physician.
• Keep in mind that, for most people, the treatment for urushiol is to reduce the itching
until the poison eventually leaves the system, at which time the rash completely clears up.
What should you put on the affected area to reduce the itching? Here are several suggestions:
• Jewelweed always ranks at the top of every list. This is a small plant with dark green
leaves and red berries, which may be found in your locality. If you are sure it is jewelweed
(and if you can find it), crush the leaves and rub them lightly on the affected area. Another
method is to ball up the whole plant and wipe it over the area.
• Other herbs include bloodroot, echinacea, goldenseal, lobelia, myrrh, plantain, or
Solomon's seal.
• Another method is to apply a tea made of 50-50 white oak bark and lime water. Place it
on a cloth, cover the area, and reapply as often as needed.
• Most poisons are either strongly acid or alkaline in pH. For an alkaline antidote to the
itching, place some form of calcium powder, mixed with water to hold it in place, on the
area. Calcium gluconate (a dietary calcium supplement) is what the author uses. It nicely
reduces the itching. An alternate alkaline method is to blend oatmeal into a fine powder,
and add a small amount of water to make a paste. Goldenseal, a very alkaline substance,
can also be used. Banana peels, rubbed directly on the area, bring relief for as long as 4
hours. Another way is to place calamine lotion on it (but beware of the antihistamine
additives in some brands of it; they can produce their own allergic rash). White shoe
polish (which contains calcium and pipe clay) has also been used, but it may contain
additives you do not want.
• There is also an acid approach to the problem! Acid substances have also been used
with success, to reduce itching: Wash lemon juice over the area, then pat dry. Repeat as
needed. Vinegar can be used.
• Wet dressings and soaks are helpful. A physiologic saline solution (2 level teaspoons of
salt to a quart of water) is useful.
• Run hot water (as hot as can be tolerated) over the area. This seems to wash off some of
the oils. Itching may stop for several hours. Repeat when needed.
• When you are finished working on the affected area, you might wish to wash rubbing
alcohol over the skin exposed to that area. This washes oils off your skin. (But this would
appear to be a poor solution, since the oiless skin ought to have a higher affinity to the
urushiol than oiled skin.)
Learn to identify the plant:
• Poison ivy is a small plant which, when a bush or tree is nearby, grows as a vine up it.
Growing in the eastern states, it has three leaves with a notch in the two outer ones. The
central leaf is at the end of the stalk.
• Poison oak is a bush, generally small but which can grow taller than a man. Growing in
the western states, it has the same three leaf and notch pattern, but the leaves are curly and
appear thicker—more like a live oak.
• Poison sumac is also a bush, and, with its compound leaves, looks very much like other
sumac. It does not have the three-leaf pattern. You are less likely to ever encounter poison
sumac.
• Avoid forest or other outdoor wood or leaf fires, if one of the three toxic plants may be
burning.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Amid all the perils of life, we need help from God. The shield of His grace
can preserve us from yielding to temptation to sin. But we must submit our lives to God if we would
have this help.
Section 16
Poisons
Part 4
Infestations

(Poison Oak; Poison Sumac)
SYMPTOMS—In those only slightly sensitive to it: One or more small round bumps with a slight pus
area showing in the center. Each one is extremely itchy. It is slightly itchy until touched by something
(clothing, a hand, etc.), when it suddenly becomes intensely itchy. Scratching brings momentary relief,
but causes redness, rash, and more itching.
In those who are very sensitive to it: Extreme redness, rash, and large swelling of the affected area. The
itch is continuous. Many large blisters develop. As the poison is spread over other parts of the body,
both fever and secondary infection may develop.
Symptoms appear within a few hours to 7 days after contact with the plant.
CAUSES—The three poison plants in North America (poison oak, ivy, and sumac) contain a oily,
slightly sticky, sap in the flowers, fruit, stem, bark; and roots which, when touched, produces a contact
papular dermatitis on the skin. The plant has the greatest amount of this sap in the spring and early
summer. The poison is urushiol, which has both a plant resin and a volatile oil. Even dead roots and
stems contain urushiol.
Scratching can transmit the toxic substance to still other parts of the body.
Contact with the poison can be made, not only by touching the plant, but by touching an animal's fur,
contaminated clothing, shoes, etc. Smoke from burning plants can, through droplets, transmit it to the
skin, nose, throat, or lungs. In some cases, children have eaten the leaves or grayish berries and
developed severe inflammation in the mouth.
Sensitivity to the plant varies from person to person, and even in different times in a person's life.
Lightweight fabrics do not adequately protect against poison ivy or oak."
disease-general-worms,Worms,"TREATMENT
Here are suggestions for purging worms from the body:
• Aloe vera, taken in any form, is especially helpful in eliminating worms.
• The following herbs help expel worms: cascara sagrada, wormwood, echinacea,
goldenseal, burdock, and black walnut. Do not use wormwood during pregnancy.
• Grapefruit tea extract helps destroy parasites. Eat black walnut extract, pumpkin seeds,
fig juice or figs, and chaparral tea or tablets.
• Take diatomaceous earth capsules for 3 weeks, to get rid of your worms. (Do not
imagine you do not have some; everyone generally does.) The worm eats this, and it
causes them to disintegrate.
• Clean the colon with enemas and colonics. Take 2 per week for 4 weeks.
• A hot water enema, with 3 teaspoons of salt to a quart of water, may get rid of
pinworms.
• Eat a diet high in fiber, primarily from raw vegetables and whole grains.
• For a time, avoid all sugar foods, including fruits, with the exception of figs and
pineapples.
• Eat figs and pumpkin seeds. This can be combined with black walnuts.
• Eat garlic, onions, cabbage, and carrots. They contain natural sulphur which helps expel
worms. As you might expect, worms do not like garlic.
• Make sure you are obtaining enough water. Drink only pure water (distilled).
• To eliminate pinworms: Eat 1-2 bitter melons each day for 7-10 days. It is available in
Asian markets.
• To eliminate tapeworms: Fast 3 days on raw pineapple. The bromelain in it destroys
those worms.
• Drink one cup of wormwood tea three times daily between meals.
• Cut up two raw onions and soak them 12 hours in 1 pint water; strain while squeezing
out the juice. Drink a cup of this 3 times a day. Along with this, use garlic enemas.
• Powdered tansy, balmony, bitterroot, and wormwood can be put in capsules. Take two
capsules 4 times a day.
• For children, crush garlic in milk and drink it throughout the day. Use a garlic enema
every morning.
• For children, make senna tea, strain it, add enough raisins to soak up the tea. Give the
children a teaspoon of raisins 2-5 times a day. Use garlic enemas, and put a garlic clove up
the rectum before bedtime.
Here are other precautionary measures which should be taken:
• Eat a nourishing diet, rich in vitamins and minerals. You need all the good nourishment
you can get. The worms are robbing you of so much.
• Make sure your children, if they have worms, are getting adequate nutrition.
• Do not eat sugar and junk food.
• Never eat watercress. It grows in streams, many of which are now polluted. Watercress,
which is eaten raw as a salad, can have pinworms and tapeworms on it.
• Do not eat raw or partly cooked fish, beef, or pork.
• Wash vegetables thoroughly before eating them raw.
• Wash all underclothing, bed clothes, and sheets frequently in hot water.
• Have all family members wash their hands frequently, especially after using the toilet,
before meals, and bedtime. Do not bite nails.
• Clean rooms frequently, especially bedrooms. Put some ammonia on a cloth, to dampen
it as a dustcloth.
• Sterilize toilet seats. The infected person should sleep alone.
—Also see ""Convulsions"" and ""Ringworm.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Living day by day with God—as we pray to Him; obey Him; and walk with
Him—can bring a peace and maturity to our lives that is so much needed.

SYMPTOMS—Allergies, diarrhea, constipation, gas and bloating, appetite loss, weight loss, anemia,
nervousness, sleep disturbances, irritable bowels, anal itching, chronic fatigue, picking at the nose, dry
cough, teeth grinding, and the appearance of worms in the toilet. Worms sometimes causes spasms or
convulsions.
CAUSES—Worms live in the gastrointestinal tract or burrow from that tract into the muscles.
There are several types of parasitic worms which can live in human intestines, including tapeworms,
hookworms, pinworms, whipworms, and roundworms.
The degree of infestation is determined, upon examination, by the type, size, and number of worms
found.
Worms tend to eat your food! They irritate your intestinal lining, and reduce even more the amount of
nutrients which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The worms also produce toxic waste which is
harmful to your body.
Causes include eating raw or poorly cooked meat; eating vegetation, polluted by contaminated water;
improper disposal of animal and human waste; and walking barefoot on soil. Scratching the anus will
transfer worm eggs on your fingers to anything else you touch.
Pinworms: Very tiny white worms, which cause rectal itching at night. Contracted by eating raw or
poorly cooked vegetables which have contacted contaminated water. Scratching the anal area can also
transmit them on the fingers. (Also see ""Rectal Itching."")
Tapeworms: Flat worms contracted from eating poorly cooked meat (beef, pork, and fish). The most
common one (beef tapeworm) can grow to 20 feet in length in the human intestine.
Hookworms: Found in southern soil and sand, they enter by boring into the feet, but can also enter when
eating with unwashed hands.
Roundworms: Most common in children, they bore through the intestinal wall and settle in other organs.
Because of the warmth of the bed, worms tend to come out of the anus. So inspect that area on children
after they are asleep.
Worm infestation can lead to arthritis, colitis, fatigue, diabetes, headaches, indigestion, lupus, nausea,
sinus trouble, back and neck pain, and cancer."
disease-general-fungus-growth,Fungus Growth,"TREATMENT
• Eat a nutritious diet, supplemented with vitamins and minerals.
• Avoid mucous-forming foods (milk and white- flour products). Do not eat meat or
processed foods.
• Keep body parts clean and dry.
• Apply crushed garlic to the affected area on the outside of the body, alternating with
honey.
• Another formula for fungal infections of any kind is tea (te or tee) tree oil. Place some on
the affected area for 2-3 weeks and the problem may be eliminated. Tea tree oil smells
like eucalyptus, and also comes from Australia.
• Fungus under the nails: This is a special problem, and quite difficult to solve. It may
take six months of careful work before results begin to be seen. The fungus is generally
under one or more toenails, and causes them to warp out of shape.
• Potassium permanganate is the remedy used on this for decades. This is poison, yet used
externally, it seems to be one of the best solutions to the problem. Permanganate is a
powerful fungus killer! And fungus under the nails demands something very special. The
permanganate also stains the skin dark brown, so after soaking your toes or feet in the
solution, they will not look very pretty. Formula: Soak the feet for half an hour in a warm
1:5,000 solution of potassium permanganate. Dry the feet thoroughly after use. This is the
same formula for athlete's foot, which is a similar fungal foot disease.
• If you need to prepare this solution at home, you dissolve a slightly rounded teaspoon of
the crystals in 8 ounces of water. Keep it in a dark-colored glass bottle. A teaspoon of this
saturated solution in a pint of water makes a solution of about 1:1,500 strength; a teaspoon
in a quart of water makes one of about 1:3,000 strength. With this information, you will be
able to prepare about any strength you might need.
• The above is one of the few powerful poisons mentioned in this book. Do not let a child
drink it!
—See ""Ringworm,"" ""Athlete's Foot,"" and ""Candidiasis"" for much more information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Live to bless others, and you will find a happiness which you have not
experienced before.

SYMPTOMS—A peculiar tiny growth on various parts of the body. It appears to be moist red patches.
In the vagina, it produces a cheesy discharge.
CAUSES—This substance is fungus, which is also called yeast or mold. It can grow under the nails,
causing them to become raised and misshapen (see ""Ringworm""). It can grow on the feet and toes (see
""Athlete's Foot""). It can grow in the throat, intestines, or vagina (see ""Candidiasis"").
Causes include a depressed immune function, taking antibiotics, or having the body damp too much of
the time. Those especially affected are those who have a depressed immune function; perspire heavily;
live in a damp environment; eat improperly; are obese, ill, diabetic, or use oral contraceptives."
disease-general-tetanus,Tetanus,"TREATMENT
• Squeeze the puncture wound repeatedly to make it bleed. Keep doing this until it bleeds
freely. If necessary, cut the area open with a clean, sharp, razor blade. You must get air to
the wound and get it to bleed freely.
• Then wash it well with soap and water; pour in hydrogen peroxide and let it fizz. Get the
blood flowing again. Then wash the area with pure water, pat dry with a sterile cloth, and
cover with a bandage.
• Call a physician. If symptoms of tetanus begin appearing, call a physician at once! It is
not too late.
Here is what nature healers in out-of-the-way places do, when there are no physicians available:
• Take cramp bark tea in teaspoon doses.
• Grind up some peach leaves and apply directly to the wound after washing it. Change
this raw poultice twice a day.
• Heat some turpentine and apply to the wound; massage it over the jaw, neck, and spine
when symptoms of lockjaw are suspected.
• Use 2 cups of wood ashes per gallon of water, and soak the limb or punctured part in it.
If the wound is located where it cannot be soaked, apply the ash solution in a fomentation.
Do this for an hour, and repeat if danger is suspected.
• If lockjaw actually appears and the person shows stiffening, give 10 drops of
antispasmodic tincture every 15 minutes until the stiffening is gone.
The formula for the tincture is as follows:
• Into a large-mouth, glass, quart jar, put 1 ounce each of the following herbs (they should
be in ground form or you should grind them first): skullcap, skunk cabbage root or seed,
gum myrrh, lobelia seed (or plant if seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root. Mix
them in the jar while dry, and add one pint of pure grain alcohol of 70 to 100 proof; 80
proof Vodka works well. Let this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shaken well
once a day. Then strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all the sediment you
can. Keep the tincture in a tightly covered jar. Put some into a small dropper bottle. It is
taken internally in 8-10 drop doses.
• In addition to the above, also give the person lobelia and cayenne. Prepare it by boiling a
quart of water, take it off the stove, and put a teaspoon lobelia powder and a teaspoon
ground cayenne into the water. Let it stand 20 minutes and drink ¼ cup every half hour till
relieved.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Make it the law of your life, from which no temptation or side interest shall
cause you to turn, to honor God. What would Jesus do if He were here? This is the question to be asked.

(Lockjaw)
SYMPTOMS—Symptoms generally appear within 5-10 days. Possible discomfort at the site of the
wound. Stiffness on opening and closing the mouth, and the person becomes restless and apprehensive.
Muscle stiffness and spasms increase and spread to more muscles in the body. The face becomes
contorted, and the slightest noise or disturbance produces muscle spasms. Pain intensifies, high fever
and exhaustion develops, followed by death.
CAUSES—Tetanus is caused by the toxin (waste product) of clostridium tetani, which normally lives in
animal manure.
Puncture wounds from stepping on dirty nails is the most likely immediate cause. The germ only grows
where there is little or no oxygen. The spores (seeds) were on that nail and, entering the body, begin to
grow and multiply. But the spores must penetrate deep enough; they cannot grow if oxygen is present. It
is the toxin that the growing tetanus produces, which paralyzes voluntary muscle tissue, including the
jaw muscle (the masseter).
Tetanus is not common; but, if contracted, it is extremely dangerous."
disease-general-parrot-fever,Parrot Fever,"TREATMENT
• Call a physician. Strict bed rest while he is receiving treatment.
• If left untreated, parrot fever can be fatal.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God wants you to choose the best gifts. And only He can give them to you.
Through continued prayer, study of His Written Word, and obedience to it, let Him ennoble your life.
You are to be His representative, showing others what it means to be a Christian.
Section 16
Poisons
Part 5
Poisoning

(Ornithosis)
SYMPTOMS—Weakness, fever, chills, and loss of appetite. Dry coughing changes into sputum
coughing.
CAUSES—The primary cause is inhaling the contaminated dust from the feathers, cage bedding, or
feces of infected birds. These birds can include parrots, parakeets, lovebirds, canaries, or pigeons. Think
especially twice about keeping a parrot or pigeon. But there is danger with the other birds also.
The disease gives the appearance of an ""atypical (unusual type of) pneumonia."" When it first starts, it is
often misdiagnosed as the flu or confused with Legionnaires disease (which see) or Q fever (which see).
Only a blood test can provide a certain diagnosis, but a history of frequent exposure to birds ought to
provide an indication of the true nature of the problem."
disease-general-poisoning,Poisoning,"TREATMENT
• Contact your nearest Poison Control Center and describe the situation to them. Have
labels of the product at hand. Every state and many large cities in America and Canada
have their own PCC phone number. There is no nationwide number. Telephone the
operator (0) or emergency (911), and they can direct you to your nearest Poison Control
Center.
• Many poisons are strong acids or strong alkalies. In such cases, the antidote will have the
opposite pH. But the PCC will know what the antidote should be. The PCC will have even
better data on the substance than will be found on the label of the product. Then contact a
physician.
• If the poison is on the outside of the body, flush with plenty of water. If inside, follow
directions on the label if no other information is available.
• Many poisons can be counteracted by taking an emetic to cause vomiting. (In the case of
certain caustic poisons, vomiting is not the best.) Put a teaspoon of salt in 2 cups of warm
water and drink it quickly. This will usually produce vomiting. Repeat a second or third
time if necessary. Tickle the throat with a finger. After vomiting has occurred, induce
more vomiting.
• If the person has swallowed a caustic acid, swallow soda, chalk, lime water, milk, or
vegetable oil first to neutralize the acid in the stomach; then induce vomiting.
• If the person has swallowed a strong alkali, then first neutralize it with lemon or vinegar.
• Swallow lots of powdered charcoal in water.
• After swallowing the powdered charcoal, to help heal the stomach, drink a tea of white
oak bark, alfalfa, oregano, or sweet basil.
• If bits of glass from a broken bottle got into the food and some was swallowed, eat lots
of soft bread. This sticky dough will tend to wrap around the glass and may help carry it
safely through the intestines.
• Cleanse the body; eat nutritious food. Include lots of fiber, including pectin in apples;
this helps discharge metals from the body. Have a hair analysis made. It will tell you how
much you have. Whole grains are all high in fiber. A urine analysis can also identify the
metal excess or deficiency.
• Vitamin A helps the body discharge poisons. Deficiency of vitamin A can cause lesions
from radiation, antibiotics, and metal poisoning. The B complex vitamins protects the
nervous system and help the liver detoxify the blood. Deficiencies of vitamin B suppress
6
the immune system. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and prevents free-radical damage.
Calcium and magnesium are natural chelating minerals. Selenium enhances the functions
of vitamin E. Zinc is a free-radical inhibitor, and helps utilize vitamin A.
• Herbs which help counteract metal poisoning include Burdock, alfalfa, chaparral,
dandelion, echinacea, fennel, garlic, juniper, kelp, lobelia, and cayenne.
• Eat eggs, onions, beans, legumes, and garlic to obtain sulfur to counteract the arsenic. It
helps to eliminate the arsenic. But do not take inorganic sulfur into the body! It will
produce boils. Only drink distilled water. Drink plenty of fruit and vegetable juices.

ENCOURAGEMENT—There are many problems which we encounter in life, but only God can help
us deal with them. Go to Him with your difficulties; He can give wisdom to know what best to do.

SYMPTOMS—Something was swallowed, smelled, or touched that caused the person to be poisoned.
CAUSES—We live in the Chemical Age, and it is taking us down rapidly. Sometimes the ongoing
poisoning becomes especially serious.
Children are especially sensitive, because they are even less careful than the rest of us.
The cause may be medicinal and street drugs, batteries, cosmetics, paints and varnishes, pesticides,
cleaning supplies, cosmetics, workplace chemicals, various gases, etc."
disease-general-chemical-poisoning,Chemical Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—A remarkable variety of symptoms can occur, among which the
following are common: stuffy nose, watery eyes, diarrhea, ringing in the ears, nausea, upset stomach,
eczema, depression, headache, fatigue, bronchitis, asthma, and arthritis.
WHERE FOUND—We live in a chemical age. These chemicals are in the air, water, earth, food, and
drink. We find them in the materials, surfaces, and fabrics in our lives. It is impossible to escape from
them, but knowledge and care can reduce the rate at which these hazards cause us harm.
Metals, such as mercury, chrome, nickel, and beryllium produce skin rashes. Aluminum is the primary
cause of Alzheimer's disease.
• Lead causes anemia.
• Dental fillings containing mercury can poison the system.
• Herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, fumigants, and fertilizers seep into the
soil, ground, water, and wells.
• These poisons are taken up by the plants which animals, birds, and humans eat; it passes
on into milk, eggs, meat. The toxic substances are in the fruit and vegetables we eat.
• There are food preservatives and additives. There are artificial colorings, flavorings, and
odors. These come from coal tar and lead to cancer.
• Waxes are on the fruit, and added sprays are on the vegetables. There are ripening agents
and defoliant chemicals.
• There are toxic fumes, dangerous chemicals, and radioactive wastes. The rivers and
lakes are polluted with poisonous runoff.
• There are hair sprays, treated bedding, animal hair products, paint formulas, and exotic
cleaning formulas.
• There is benzene from solvents, styrene from plastics, and formaldehyde from pressed-
wood products.
• Smoke arises from cigarettes, cigars, and burning forest fires.
• We hardly have time to worry about old-fashioned dust, molds, parasites, and diseases.
We now live amid an onslaught of chemicals and radiation.

ENCOURAGEMENT—As you try to help others, you will yourself be helped. There are those all
about us who need a friend they can talk to and pray with. The more you help them, the more help you
will receive yourself."
disease-general-aluminum-poisoning,Aluminum Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASES—Many symptoms are similar to those of Alzheimer's disease (which
see) and osteoporosis (which see).
Other symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, colic, rickets, extreme nervousness, headache,
anemia, poor kidney and liver function, speech disturbances, memory loss, weak and aching muscles,
and softening of bones.
It is believed, by many, that Alzheimer's disease is caused by aluminum poisoning. Aluminum was little
used until the 1940s, when an inexpensive method was found to extract it from Bauxite by running an
electric current through that ore. Since then, Alzheimer's has rapidly increased.
An excess of either aluminum or silicon in the body results in reduced absorption of calcium and other
minerals. Aluminum salts in the brain produces impaired mental abilities and seizures. The autopsied
brains of Alzheimer's patients had four times as much aluminum as did those of other people.
Aluminum also damages the kidneys which try to excrete it from the body.
WHERE FOUND—Aluminum pots, pans, and other cookware. Aluminum foil, antiperspirants,
deodorants, bleached flour, regular table salt, tobacco smoke, processed cheese, cream of tartar,
douches, canned goods, baking powder, antacids, buffered aspirin, and most city water. Processed
cheese is high in it, for the aluminum helps it melt when heated. Never use aluminum (or copper)
cookware! Use stainless steel or glass whenever possible.
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing aluminum. Avoid aluminum sources and
environments.
Drink plenty of fruit and vegetable juices.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not allow the perplexities and worries of everyday life to fret your mind
and come between you and God. You need Him all the more in the troubles you encounter. Do not
forsake Him."
disease-general-arsenic-poisoning,Arsenic Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Confusion, headaches, drowsiness, convulsions, vomiting, muscle
cramps, diarrhea, bloody urine, and gastrointestinal problems. Alopecia, constipation, delayed healing of
skin problems, edema, burning and tingling, and stomatitis. The lungs, skin, and liver are primarily
affected.
WHERE FOUND—Herbicides, slug poisons, pesticides, beer, water, table salt, seafood, tobacco
smoke, laundry aids, smog, dolomite, and bone meal. Copper smelting, mining shafts, sheep dipping.
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing arsenic. Avoid arsenic sources and
environments.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Thank God there are answers! Go to Him in prayer and you will receive the
help you need. He can give you guidance that you very much need."
disease-general-cadmium-poisoning,Cadmium Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Anemia; joint soreness; hair loss; dry, scaly skin; dulled sense of
smell; high blood pressure; loss of appetite. It can lead to emphysema and cancer.
Cadmium is a trace metal; but it is poisonous and weakens the immune system by decreasing T-cell
production in the body. It is increasingly found in many substances.
Cadmium stores up in the liver and kidneys, seriously weakening both organs.
WHERE FOUND—Cigarette and cigar smokers have high cadmium levels, but you can get it from
second-hand smoke. Cadmium is in plastics, white paint, and nickel-cadmium batteries. It is in drinking
water, pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers, industrial air pollution, and various foodstuffs, including rice,
coffee, tea, soft drinks, and refined grains.
SOLUTIONS—Avoid cadmium sources and environments.

ENCOURAGEMENT—As you open your door to needy ones, you are inviting angels to come in. Do
what you can to be a blessing to those around you, and you will be blessed."
disease-general-copper-poisoning,Copper Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Excess amounts of copper can result in emotional problems,
behavioral disorders, mood swings, anemia, depression, kidney damage, eczema, schizophrenia, sickle-
cell anemia, and central nervous system damage.
It can produce infections, heart attack, anemia, cirrhosis of the liver, mental illness, insomnia, stuttering,
Wilson's disease, and niacin deficiency.
WHERE FOUND—Beer, copper plumbing and cookware, insecticides, permanent wave kits,
pasteurized milk, oral contraceptives, tobacco, swimming pools, city water, and various foods, including
certain frozen foods (added to make peas greener).
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing copper. Avoid copper sources and
environments.
DEFICIENCY—It is also possible to not have enough copper in the body. Without a balance of copper
and zinc in the body, the thyroid will not work properly. Babies fed soy milk tend to have a deficiency
of copper. The result is damaged nerves, bones, and lungs. Adults lacking copper will lose protein.
Excessively large doses of zinc can also produce a copper deficiency. Oral contraceptives can cause
either an excess or deficiency of copper.
—For additional information, see ""Chemical Poisoning.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Keep cheerful and sunny. This will encourage those around you to take heart.
They have problems too. Kneel down and pray with them."
disease-general-ddt-poisoning,Ddt Poisoning,"THE PROBLEM—We still have DDT poisoning. First introduced in 1939, into agriculture, to kill
insects, and banned in December 1972. DDT is still here.
First, it has long-lasting effects on birds, fish, animals, and humans. Second, it is still in the water and
soil.
Third, shipments of DDT food from overseas is not banned. Food grown in Israel is heavily DDTed, and
then shipped to America because orthodox Jews will not allow it to be sold in Israel. Fourth, it is still
used on fruit trees in America!
SOLUTIONS—Avoid DDT sources and environments. Special note: Do not fast on water alone;
always do it on fruit juices. This is because DDT is stored in your body fat. During a water fast, its
sudden release can damage various organs. Only drink distilled water. Drink plenty of fruit and
vegetable juices.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Come up to the light of God's Word, where Jesus is, and you will find all the
guidance you need on the pathway to heaven."
disease-general-lead-poisoning,Lead Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Lead poisoning produces hyperactivity in children, behavioral
problems, and weakened minds.
Chronic lead poisoning causes reproductive disorders, impotence in men, infertility in women, and
anemia. Sudden infant death syndrome occurs more often in infants with high lead levels than those who
die of other causes.
Toxic amounts damage liver, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. Those suffering from lead poisoning
will have days of severe gastrointestinal colic. Gums turn blue and he may feel muscle weakness.
Paralysis of the extremities, blindness, mental disturbances, protein disorder, loss of memory, mental
retardation, and even insanity can eventually result. Painter's colic shows severe wandering pain in the
abdomen and acute muscle spasm.
Sometimes you will find a lead line on the gum margin of the teeth.
WHERE FOUND—Lead is extremely toxic, and is widely found in leaded gasoline; lead pipes; and
other piping using solder, ceramic glazes, lead-based paints, and lead-acid batteries. Lead arsenate is an
insecticide used on certain plants. Burning newspapers throw lead into the air. Lead is in commercial
baby milk and industrial materials (nails, solder, plating, plaster, and putty).
People also consume it when they use tobacco, eat liver, and drink domestic or imported wines. It can
also be in soldered cans.
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing lead. Avoid lead sources and environments.
Buy only canned goods which are lead-free. These cans have been welded and have no soldered side
seems. Do not use imported canned goods; no regulations cover them. Only drink distilled water. Drink
plenty of fruit and vegetable juices.
Stay off the main highways whenever possible, and do not live near them. Lead fumes and other noxious
chemicals and metals are still coming out of car exhausts. Do not grow family garden crops near the
highways.
Do not have lead or copper water pipes in your home; use PVC (plastic) pipes instead. Copper pipes are
connected with lead solder. Solder leaches a significant amount of lead into the water supply, especially
during the first few years after installation. Lead solder was not banned until 1986.
Do not drink out of glazed pottery—especially if it is imported! The glaze can contain lead, which will
leach into your fruit juice, etc.
Vitamin E tends to reduce the effects of lead poisoning.
Drink aloe vera gel or liquid.

ENCOURAGEMENT—If we have Christ abiding with us, we shall be Christians at home as well as
abroad. He who is a Christian will have kind words for all he associates with. As we do this, our own
hearts will be warmed the more with Christ's love."
disease-general-mercury-poisoning,Mercury Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Allergies, anxiety, metallic taste, gastroenteritis, burning mouth pain,
salivation, abdominal pain, tremors, uncontrolled crying, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.
Mercury poisoning can lead to colitis, kidney disease, dermatitis, asthma, hair loss, gingivitis, mental
and emotional disturbances, and nerve damage.
It is believed, by many, that multiple sclerosis is caused by mercury poisoning.
Arriving in the brain, it is stored there and produces dizziness, insomnia, weakness, fatigue, depression,
and memory loss.
Symptoms in a child include hyperactivity, irritability, depression, and behavioral changes.
WHERE FOUND—Mercury is more toxic than lead, and can be ingested or inhaled. It is stored in the
brain and in the fat.
At normal temperatures, it tends to change from a solid into a gas. This means that the mercury in the
amalgam fillings in your mouth are always ready, when the opportunity presents itself, to pass into
saliva and be swallowed. Acids in food provide that opportunity. Amalgam is over 50% mercury.
Minute amounts of methyl mercury are released from the tooth filling as you chew your food.
Eventually it passes into the organs and brain.
Nearly 100 chemicals are placed in mouths by dentists—including mercury, copper, nickel, beryllium,
zinc, phenol, formaldehyde, disocyanate, and acetone.
Mercury is also found in streams, lakes, fish, shellfish, and sewage. The problem is that it is added to
insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Grains and seeds are frequently treated with it, to keep out bugs.
We would rather eat a stray bug than mercury. Gradually these substances have gone into the rivers and
lakes, contaminating the fish.
Mercury is also included in fabric softeners, polishes, wood preservatives, latex, solvents, plastics, ink,
and some paints. It is in cosmetics, laxatives which have calomel, some hemorrhoidal suppositories, and
a variety of other medications.
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing mercury. Avoid mercury sources and
environments.
Remove the mercury (amalgam) fillings from your teeth. Sweating helps excrete mercury. Selenium also
helps eliminate it.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Tell the one in trouble, ""Let us pray."" Kneel down together and unload your
hearts to God. Find in Him the peace and help that both of you need."
disease-general-nickel-poisoning,Nickel Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Skin rashes, respiratory illness, and myocardial infarction. It also
interferes with the Kreb's cycle.
WHERE FOUND—Nickel is found in hydrogenated fats and oils and refined and processed foods,
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing nickel. Avoid nickel sources and environments.
Do not pierce your ears or wear metal jewelry containing nickel. The posts placed in pierced ears are
nickel, and cause nickel rash. This rash will appear everywhere in your body when you are wearing
metal of any kind. The cause is the nickel in those ear posts or in the earrings. Leave your ears the way
God made them.
Avoid nickel alloys in dental work.
—For additional information, see ""Chemical Poisoning.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Where can we find help? Only in God! No one on earth can fill our deepest
needs. Only He who created us can give what is needed, as we cry to Him in faith for help."
disease-general-radiation-poisoning,Radiation Poisoning,"TREATMENT
• There are instances in which a careful home-care recovery program nicely solved the
problem.
• In one case, a young man was told he had a severe case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and
that it might require 2 years to recover.
Refusing cortisone shots, he used natural healing methods: heavy on vitamins and minerals, especially B
complex, plus extra pantothenic acid, and vitamin C with bioflavonoids. In addition to other minerals, he
emphasized calcium, potassium, and extra chelated minerals. Herbs included blue vervain, licorice root,
chamomile echinacea, burdock, and ginkgo. He also took chlorophyll, green drinks, fruit and vegetable
juices, especially carrot and beet juice. Within a month, he was well and back to work, with no residual
problems later occurring.
ENCOURAGEMENT—A lamp, however small, may be the means of lighting many other lamps.
Trusting in Jesus, do what you can to encourage another, and you will be more courageous yourself.

SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Dizziness, mental fatigue, eye fatigue, severe headache, cataracts, and
nausea.
WHERE FOUND—Medical and dental X rays (which see), television, cellular phones, video display
terminals, satellite dishes, building materials containing radon or uranium, computers, microwave ovens,
satellites, high-voltage electric lines, radar devices, electronic games, smoke detectors, and tobacco.
Radioactive substances are composed of unstable atoms which can harm the body. When radiation
strikes a cell, it alters, damages, or destroys it. Whether a little or a lot, radiation is a killer.
Living tissue is damaged when ionizing radiation strikes it. This is radiation powerful enough to shift
electrons from one collection of atoms to another. Such restructuring of tissue can result in disease or
cancer.
A significant percentage of women inherit a gene that is sensitive to X-ray exposure. In those women,
even a short exposure to X rays can lead to cancer.
SOLUTIONS—Avoid radiation sources and environments.
In order to protect the body from radioactive elements, you must eat enough non-radioactive ones. For
example, if you are not obtaining enough calcium, your body will absorb radioactive strontium-90 from
the air. Where did the strontium-90 come from? from an exploded nuclear bomb halfway around the
world. The same is true for regular iodine vs. radioactive iodine (iodine-131), which destroys the
thyroid.
Foods which protect against radiation include fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
Foods which reduce one's ability to be protected against radiation include meat, poultry, dairy products,
sugar, refined food, and food with chemical additives.
—For additional information, see ""Chemical Poisoning.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Our time here is short. We can pass through this world but once. While we are
here, let us do all we can to help and bless others. There are so many around us who need our help. In
Christ's strength, you can minister to many of their needs.
GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME
SYMPTOMS—This begins with neurological weakness in the arms, legs, and face. As it progresses,
paralysis of the motor nerves can occur. This can lead to respiratory failure. As the condition worsens,
there is strong anxiety, fear, and panic, and depression. Convalescence and recovery can be slow, with
the possibility of permanent nerve damage.
CAUSES—This is another disease produced by vaccinations. Normally, such a condition would never
occur. But when fluids, drawn from animals, are injected into the human bloodstream, terrible
consequences can result.
Gerald Ford's introduction of a nationwide vaccination program, in the winter of 1976-1977, was a
disaster and resulted in many cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Other possible factors could be surgery, a viral infection, Hodgkin's disease, rabies, or lupus (each of
which, except surgery, see)."
disease-general-toxemia,Toxemia,"HYDRO—Here are some suggestions from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet),
on the topic of detoxifying the body:
Adsorb toxins: Poultices made of charcoal, clay, and glycerin, etc. (p. 86).
Eliminate toxins: These are procedures which encourage vital resistance to disease while at the same
time encouraging the destruction of toxins by stimulating the toxin-destroying cells of the thyroid, liver,
spleen, lymphatics, and other tissues: Hepatic Douche, Splenic Douche, General Cold Douche. (The
word, ""douche,"" in hydrotherapy, means ""spray."") Steam Bath (p. 39) and Hot Fomentations (p. 70).
Remove waste products: Contrast Baths to the arm, hand, leg, or foot (pp. 112-118).
Combat local toxemia, resulting degenerations, and localized inflammations: Hot blanket Pack followed
by Sweating Wet Sheet Pack; repeat every 3-4 hours if necessary. Fomentation to throat every 2-3 hours
for 15 minutes; Ice Compress to throat during intervals; if inflammation becomes intense and sloughing
is threatened, the Heating Compress at 60o F., changing every hour. Steam Inhalation (p. 191).
Combat toxemia: Sweating procedures, Radiant Hot Bath, Sweating Wet Sheet Pack, Steam Bath,
prolonged Neutral Bath. Follow hot baths by short cold applications, such as a Wet Sheet Rub, Cold
Towel Rub, Cold Shower, Spray Douche, copious water drinking. Enema daily for a week or two, at 70o
F (p. 207).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Give to God the most precious offering you can give. Give Him your heart.
He will take it and, with your cooperation, make it pure and clean.

disease-general-tobacco-withdrawal,Tobacco Withdrawal,"TREATMENT
• Withdrawal symptoms include cough, depression, anxiety, headaches, stomach cramps,
irritability, hunger, and cravings for tobacco. This continues for about 2 weeks. If
supplementary treatment is given, the crisis can be weathered easier, and with less
likelihood of a return to smoking.
• In order to quit, it is best to accompany a firm decision with a cleansing program. This
helps speed up the elimination of stored-up nicotine and other poisons. The quicker this
happens, the faster the cravings cease.
• A nutritious diet must be adhered to. Carrot juice and citrus juices are very helpful.
Vitamin C is important.
• Take the tobacco pack or can and throw it away. In its place put a candy bar. Blood
sugar level is a factor in the addiction. When the cravings are successful gone, throw away
the candies.
• Take extra calcium and eat chamomile 3-6 times a day. Both will help relax during the
withdrawal period. Vitamin B complex is also important for the nerves.
• Lobelia contains lobeline, which is similar to nicotine. It is non-addictive, but helps a
person quit tobacco. Here is how to use it in aversion therapy:
• Only smoke one hour each day, at which time 15 drops of lobelia, diluted in water, are
swallowed every half an hour and then 15 minutes before lighting the first cigarette. With
each 15-minute period, an additional 15 drops are added to the water to drink—while the
cigarettes are smoked. The result will be nausea, which the person will associate with the
cigarettes. This kills the desire for the cigarettes.
• If the lobelia method is not used, the alternative must be a definite quit all at once
approach. See the author's book.
HYDRO—Here are suggestions from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
Heating and Sweating Packs are also used for the elimination of nicotine from the body, which lessens
the physical craving for more tobacco (p. 64).
The Steam Bath is also useful in tobacco addictions (p. 131).
Eliminating the tobacco habit: Drop the drug at once. Put him to bed. Sweating procedures (such as
Radiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath, sweating Wet Sheet Pack), twice daily; follow with short cold
application, as Shallow Cold Bath, Wet Sheet Rub, or Cold Douche. Alternate hot and cold Compress to
spine 3 times a day; Hot Abdominal Pack day and night, renewing 3 times daily; copious water drinking;
large Colonic daily (p. 192).
—See the author's book, You can Quit Tobacco (see order sheet), now in his book compilation, Help for
Your Family (see order sheet). It is full of worthwhile information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God can give you the help you need. Go to Him and tell Him you need His
help. Surrender your life to Him. In His strength, you can overcome the tobacco habit.

SYMPTOMS—A continual craving for tobacco in some form.
If the person smokes, there is irritation and inflammation of throat and lungs, chronic cough, chronic
bronchitis, and premature aging of the skin. This eventually leads to lung cancer, high blood pressure,
osteoporosis, emphysema, respiratory ailments, heart disease, stroke, and/or many other diseased
conditions and cancers. Women will have intensified problems with menstruation and menopause, and
men will have greater prostate trouble. Women who smoke age twice as fast as other women. Their skin
rapidly ages; and the result is a dull, lifeless, gray, deteriorating complexion, and wrinkles.
If one chews tobacco, there is irritation and inflammation of the lips, mouth, teeth, throat, and
esophagus. This eventually leads to cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, and
other diseases.
CAUSES—Nicotine is remarkable for the vast number of harmful chemicals it naturally contains, and
those which are added to it during growth or processing of the leaves. Nicotine is also remarkable for its
addictive qualities. It ranks with heroin, and some who have been hooked on both declare it to be worse
to quit than heroin. Like heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, tobacco gives a sense of relaxing while making
the heart pump harder (12-25 beats per minute faster), causing palpitations and a generalized feeling of
anxiety. For the smoker who takes the last puff before bedtime, the circulatory system is only normal 2
hours out of every 24.
Each cigarette destroys 25 mg of vitamin C; a full pack in one day eliminates more of this vitamin than
is in the diet.
In America alone, tobacco causes 35% of all cancer deaths, 78% of all fatal heart attacks, 18% of deaths
of all kinds, 85% of lung cancer, and 85% of obstructive pulmonary disease. More Americans die each
year from smoking than from alcohol, illegal drugs, traffic accidents, murder, or suicide. Those coffin
nails shorten lifespan by at least 15-20 years. These are some of the blessings you get from the nicotine:
lead, carcinogens, cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and over 5,000 other irritating
chemicals in tobacco. Tobacco not only injures you, but it also damages those around you: your spouse,
your children, your unborn, and fellow workmen. Did you know that the breath of a smoker contains
slightly more nicotine than the side smoke from his cigarette? Men and women who smoke are
constantly exhaling air into the room for their children to breathe."
disease-general-alcohol-withdrawal,Alcohol Withdrawal,"TREATMENT
• Stop drinking alcohol entirely. Begin eating very nutritious food. Vitamins A, B
complex, C, D, and K are needed, in addition to zinc, iron, potassium, calcium, essential
fatty acids, bioflavonoids, and adequate protein. Sea kelp is important, to help the thyroid.
• Certain foods increase the craving for alcohol in those who indulge in it. These include
milk, wheat, corn products, chocolate, and sugar.
• After going off alcohol, do not substitute large amounts of sugar products and strong
coffee. Sugar only increases the hypoglycemic problem. Nourish the system with good
food; do not sugarize it.
• The alcoholic craves potassium. A tablespoonful of honey, to take the place of a beer,
supplies some of the potassium which has been depleted by the alcohol. Also high in
potassium is potato peel soup. The peelings should be about a half inch thick; discard the
rest of the potatoes. Cover with water, cook well, then blend and add a little salt. He
should eat it often with his meals.
• A teaspoon of 50-50 powdered charcoal and honey will help sober up a drunk person.
• People who regularly eat good nourishing food are less likely to crave stimulants or
addictive substances. Especially eat raw fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Meat eating will
bring back the craving for alcohol, so quit meat.
• Slippery elm is also good to drink while going off alcohol.
• Quassia chips help destroy the taste for liquor. Put 1 teaspoon in a cup of boiled water,
steep a half hour, covered. Take a swallow every 2 hours. Stay with someone, so you will
not be tempted to go out and buy more of the cursed stuff.
HYDRO—Here are suggestions from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
The Neutral Wet Sheet Pack is excellent for alcoholic delirium. A Neutral Bath will accomplish the
same purpose as a Neutral Pack, and probably do it better (p. 63). Heating and Sweating Packs are also
used for alcoholism (p. 64).
The Neutral Bath has been successful in bringing quiet and rest to alcoholic delirium tremens (p. 124).
Withdraw alcohol at once; nutritive enemas; copious water drinking; Neutral Colonic daily, for a week
(p. 211).
The Steam Bath is also useful in chronic alcoholism (p. 131).
Eliminating alcoholism —
General: Nourishing food, especially fruits. Meats and flesh foods must be strictly prohibited, also meat
juices, broths, and all preparations of flesh. Fomentation over the stomach, twice a day, with Hot
Abdominal Pack between applications; short sweating baths (Radiant Heat Bath, sweating Wet Sheet
Pack), followed by Wet Sheet Rub; Graduated Cold Baths twice a day.
Insomnia: Neutral Bath at bedtime, 94o-96o F., 20-60 minutes; Hot Abdominal Pack at night.
Vomiting: Ice pills swallowed, ice bag over stomach, hot and cold compress over stomach.
Delirium tremens: Rest in bed; Hot Full Bath for 5 minutes; Hot Blanket Pack, followed by sweating
Wet Sheet Pack; Neutral Bath 1-2 hours or longer twice a day; Ice Cap; hot Fomentations over stomach
and abdomen every 3 hours, for 15 minutes; during intervals between; Heating Compress, changing
every 30-60 minutes; copious water drinking; large Enema daily. Exclusive fruit diet for 2-3 days.
Counteract narcotic effects of alcohol: Cold Shower; water drinking or Enema, followed by short Cold
Douche to spine and lower sternum. Repeat every hour or two, if necessary, until the toxic effects
disappear.
Nephritis: Usually present in acute alcoholism, and must be dealt with.
General Method: He must be placed in a proper environment; isolation and temporary confinement may
be required. Suitable mental and moral influences must be brought to bear (p. 191).
—Also see the author's book, You Can Quit Alcohol (see order sheet), now in his larger book, Help for
Your Family (see order sheet).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Only in Christ's strength can you be strong to resist the temptations which
assail you. Plead with God for forgiveness. Accept Christ as your Saviour, and ask Him to make you a
new person. If you are determined to stand true, and cry to Him moment by moment as His little child,
He can help you overcome.

SYMPTOMS—Dependence on, and addiction to, alcoholic beverages. Depression; blackouts;
hangovers; vehicle, and other, arrests; ulcers; emotional problems; flushing of the face; forgetfulness;
heart palpitation; indigestion; insomnia; urinary problems; hepatitis; hypertension; divorce; hard drugs;
and numbness in the extremities.
CAUSES—Alcohol is absorbed directly through the walls of the stomach, without digestion. It then
travels in the bloodstream to every cell in the body, where it extracts water. This weakens or kills cells.
The effect on the liver, brain, and vital organs is especially damaging. Most alcoholics are either
hypoglycemic or borderline diabetics.
In addition, alcohol produces severe nutritional deficiencies. The body thinks it is well-fed (alcohol
contains 70 calories per ounce), when it is being slowly starved.
The liver slowly breaks the alcohol down to sugar. Eventually the difficult task weakens this vital organ,
and fatty liver degeneration begins. Scar tissue develops; the experts call it cirrhosis.
Alcohol is deceptive: It makes a person feel happy when he is miserable, and makes him feel strong
when he is weak. It ruins his liver, destroys his marriage, hurts his children, eliminates his employment,
and makes a bum out of him. The liquor industry should be closed down."
disease-general-coffee-withdrawal,Coffee Withdrawal,"PROBLEMS—Coffee and black tea are both addictive and damaging to the system. If you think you
are not addicted to your coffee, try immediately terminating its use.
HYDRO—The following suggestions for withdrawing from the coffee and black tea addictions are from
the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
Discontinue the use of the drug at once. If necessary, employ some harmless cereal substitute. Neutral
Bath at bedtime; Fomentation over abdomen; alternate Sponging of the spine; Cold Mitten Friction or
Cold Towel Rub before rising in the morning; Hot Abdominal Pack night and day, changing morning,
noon, and night; short sweating Wet Sheet Pack or Steam Bath 2-3 times a week, followed by a cold
application (p. 192).
There is one flaw in the above formula (which originally came from John Harvey Kellogg at the turn of
the century). It is now known that, when it is regularly used, the body enters into a very special chemical
dependency on coffee. Immediate withdrawal can cause heart problems. Therefore, gradually go off
coffee, taking less and less of it, over a seven-day period.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God can help you, just where you are. He can reach down and lift you up, and
help you overcome the coffee habit."
disease-general-drug-withdrawal,Drug Withdrawal,"TREATMENT
• Withdrawal must be done. When a person is highly dependent on a drug, it is best that the dose
gradually be reduced slowly, over a four-week period. Regarding the hard drugs, it is best that
withdrawal be done under professional guidance.
• Nutritious food should be eaten along with heavy vitamin/mineral supplementation. Vitamin C and the
B complex are especially important. Drink lots of water and get extra rest. Take sweat baths, to help
excrete poisons.
HYDRO—The following hydrotherapy methods used for opium, cocaine, and related habits are from the
author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
General: Rest in bed. Sweating baths (such as Radiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath) twice a day for 3 days
before withdrawing the drug. Follow bath by vigorous cold applications. While withdrawing the drug,
the symptoms may be successfully combated as follows:
Nervousness, restlessness, ""indescribable sensations"": Prolonged Neutral Bath at 92o-94o F., for 10
minutes; Neutral Douche at 92o F. for 2-4 minutes.
Cardiac weakness: Cold Compress or Ice Bag over heart; alternate (hot and then cold) applications to
the spine; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub, repeating treatment hourly if necessary.
Vomiting: Hot and Cold Truck Pack, Ice Bag over stomach and spine, Hot Leg Pack.
Diarrhea: Hot Enema after each movement; Cold Compress over abdomen, changed every 30 minutes.
Local pain: Revulsive Compresses, alternate or hot and cold Compress.
Insomnia after withdrawal: Wet Sheet pack; Prolonged Neutral Bath, 20-60 minutes; Heating Leg Pack;
Hot Abdominal Pack; cold Ice Cap.
General Method: Same as for alcoholism. Withdraw gradually within 2-3 days (pp. 191-192).
—Also see ""Alcohol Withdrawal"" and ""Tobacco Withdrawal.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Every habit can be resisted and overcome in the strength of Christ. He died to
forgive your sins and strengthen you to resist the temptations of the devil. Trust in Him, live for Him,
and determine that you shall do what is right.

Tumors, Cancer
Part 1
Tumors and Cancer

SYMPTOMS—Decreased desire to work, inattentiveness, extreme drowsiness, frequent mood swings,
loss of appetite, and restlessness.
Prolonged use may result in damage to cells and chromosomes; male sterility; respiratory organs, liver,
kidney damage; and cancer.
Withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, headache, diarrhea, sensitivity to light and noise, hot and cold
flashes, sweating, deep depression, irritability, disorientation, and irrational thinking.
CAUSES—There are legal drugs, called medicinal drugs. You can obtain these at a pharmacy, either
with or without a prescription. There are also illegal ones, called hard drugs or street drugs. These
include narcotics, stimulants, barbiturates, and hallucinogens. In nearly every instance, drugs are toxic
and dangerous. There are exceptions; these are natural products which the FDA erroneously classifies as
""drugs."" (See ""Drug Rash."") Included here are such things as charcoal tablets and peppermint tea.
People often start taking street drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, and coffee, thinking them to be harmless,
enjoyable, or beneficial. But they are neither. Frequently the dose is increased, to obtain the same
pleasant effect; but an overdose may eventually occur, and death results."
disease-general-cysts-and-polyps,Cysts And Polyps,"TREATMENT
• A Wisconsin research team discovered that the polyps in most of their patients either
lessened or disappeared entirely, when they were placed on a high vitamin C diet. The
body is attempting to get rid of various waste products; it needs help doing the job.
Vitamin C; more water drinking; nutritious food; a high-fiber diet; and the elimination of
processed, fried, and junk foods greatly helps. Take some type of supplemental fiber daily.
Be sure to increase your water intake at the same time you increase your fiber intake.
• Stop eating meat products. They load the body with impurities which must be
eliminated. Only eat wholesome food. Stop using caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol.
• Those who eat the most saturated fat are twice as likely to develop polyps.
• Use those natural substances which tends to cleanse the body of toxins: garlic, burdock,
goldenseal, red clover, etc.
• Surgical removal of the polyp is often relatively safe, a minor procedure, and done on an
outpatient basis.
—Read the sections on ""Cancer"" and ""Cancer Prevention"" for detailed information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Throughout the trials of life we have a never-failing Friend. God can do for
you what you could never do for yourself. Ask Him for help.

SYMPTOMS—In the nose: chronic difficulty in breathing through the nose.
In the colon: Bleeding or a mucous drainage from the rectum are common symptoms.
In the bladder: Blood in the urine.
In the cervix: A heavy watery, bloody, discharge from the vagina. Bleeding may occur after intercourse,
between periods, and after menopause.
CAUSES—Polyps (polyposis) are growths of various sizes, and are especially found in certain portions
of the mucous membranes: the nose, large intestine (colon), bladder, and cervix. They are especially
common in the rectum and the portion of the colon just above that (the sigmoid).
These growths are benign (that is, not cancerous) and, growing on stalk-like structures, look something
like narrow mushrooms. They tend to be hereditary.
Nasal polyps: Generally when the nose is clogged, the cause is a heavy cold or possibly chronic catarrh.
But it can be nasal polyps. These are a special kind of tumor, which usually form as a result of a chronic
infection in a sinus or in persons having allergies. Surgical removal is done to remove them.
Colon and rectal polyps: These growths in the outlet end of the colon can become cancerous. A
colectomy is the surgical removal of these polyps, but is generally done, not by cutting out the polyps,
but by removing part of the colon! Sometimes the rectum is left in place and the small intestine is
connected to it. But, whether this drastic operation is performed or not, the polyps generally return.
Bleeding from the colon can be a sign of polyps or of cancer.
Bladder polyps: The medical route is removal of the bladder. Unless they are removed, by natural
methods or unnatural, bladder cancer may result.
Cervical polyps: These polyps line the inside of the cervix of the uterus and are more common in
women who have not had children. They rarely return after being removed."
disease-general-tumors,Tumors,"TREATMENT
• The body uses tumors as containers to store toxic waste collected throughout the body,
when the system's natural ways of elimination are overloaded: the lungs, bowels, kidneys,
liver, and skin. But when these channels of elimination become clogged or inadequate to
care for the excess refuse, then the body starts manufacturing garbage cans (tumor cases)
and placing the waste products in them.
• A physician can cut, burn, chemical, or radiate away the garbage can and its contents;
but soon the body will manufacture more of them!
• The solution is to change your way of life. A complete change of diet is needed, along
with improved ways of eliminating waste from the body.
—Read the sections on ""Cancer"" and ""Cancer Prevention"" for detailed information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—How thankful we can be that we can go to God for help. He who sent His Son
to die, so we could have eternal life, can help you.

(including Fibroids)
SYMPTOMS—Tumors, swellings, or growths on the body. They seem to contain solid or semifluid
material and be abnormal in their growth.
CAUSES—When something has no apparent reason to be growing, it is growing abnormally. These
structures are called tumors. They can be either benign or malignant (cancerous). Malignant tumors
spread to other parts of the body; whereas benign ones generally do not spread.
Fibroids are tumors which most often occur in the uterus. Hysterectomies are done to remove them. But
the effect of a hysterectomy on a woman's hormonal system can be devastating. Avoid them, if at all
possible.
Diet and environment are special causes of tumors. Changing both can reverse the process, and even
eliminate these strange growths.
It is best to eliminate them, whenever possible. Even the benign ones, although small, may later become
cancerous."
disease-general-skin-cancer,Skin Cancer,"TREATMENT
• Exposure to the sun is vital to good health. Unfortunately, the ultraviolet rays also cause
wrinkles and 90% of all types of skin cancer. (It can cause cataracts too.) Yes, continue to
get out in the sunlight, but try not to overdo it. Keep in mind that, in the early stages, it is
not difficult to remove skin cancers; but you have to have a certain amount of sunlight for
general physical health. Be especially careful between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when sunlight
is strongest.
• Those with a family history of skin cancer should obtain their sunlight more sparingly.
• In the summer, wear light-colored clothing which has a tight weave. Consider using a
sunscreen of at least 15.
• Tanning salons are more dangerous than sunlight, because people tend to overdo them.
• As the ozone layer is gradually destroyed over the north and south poles, those living in
the temperate zones throughout the world become more susceptible to skin
cancer—without even being in the sun.
• Every month or so check over your body carefully and look for signs of skin cancer.
Then do something about it.
Suggestions for eliminating the skin cancer:
• You can go to your physician, and he will excise it with a knife or an ointment which
will burn it off. If you delay, surgery will cut more deeply and, as with all cancer surgery,
there is the very real danger that not all the cancer will be removed.
• Or you can use natural remedies. Fortunately, with skin cancer, as long as it is treated in
the early stages, you can tell if it is gone!
• Garlic is a faithful standby. Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you
consider might be, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If you
can't avoid it, the skin will redden and burn somewhat.) Russian research, from back in the
1950s, revealed that garlic is more powerful than antibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also
causes moles and skin cancers to fall off.
• Put the garlic on in the morning; take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening
before bedtime. Put on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the
process. Do this for about 3 days. The mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the
area heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process at a later time.
• If you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the
skin (you will know, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not
necessary to slough off the cancer, and could be harmful.
• The herb, chaparral, works well for skin cancer. Take it as a tea or in tablet form.
• According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate
amount of essential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancers. It even helps
eliminate them, once they form.
• Eat a nourishing diet; go off meat and processed, fried, and junk food. Get enough rest.
Right living helps your body resist and throw off cancerous lesions.
• Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance; also take vitamin A and selenium.
• Carcelim is a cream which you can purchase, which requires 30 days to remove the
melanoma.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Take your problems to God, for He can help you know what to do. He can
lead you to solutions which are the best.

(Melanoma)
SYMPTOMS—Identification is especially important in dealing with skin cancer. Here are official
warning signs of skin cancer:
1. An open sore that bleeds, crusts over, and will not heal properly.
2. A reddish, irritated, spot that is usually on the chest, shoulder, arm, or leg. It may itch,
hurt, or cause no discomfort at all.
3. A smooth growth with an elevated border and a center indentation. As it becomes
bigger, tiny blood vessels develop on the surface.
4. A shiny scar-like area that may be white, yellow, or waxy with a shiny, taut,
appearance.
5. An enlarging, irregular, ""angry"" appearing lesion on the face, lips, or ears.
Here is a description of one of the more common types of skin cancer: large flat, tan, or brown spots,
with darker black or brown areas dotted on its surface. The edges may, or may not, be clearly defined.
The spot may appear mottled.
Moles should also be watched—especially those that change in size or color, are irregularly shaped,
have ridges around the edges, widen, bleed, itch, or seem to be continually irritated by clothing.
Here are still more identifiers of skin cancer—the so-called ""A-B-C-D checklist"":
Asymmetry: Both sides of the mole should be shaped similarly. If the overall shape is
irregular, then it might be skin cancer.
Border: The edges of moles should be smooth, not blurred or ragged.
Color: It should be tan, brown, and dark brown if it is normal. If it is red, white, blue, or
black, it is not.
Diameter: Any mole that is larger than ¼ inch in diameter, or whose diameter seems to be
increasing, should be treated with suspicion.
Spots which are dry, red, and scaly (most frequently found on the face, neck, or backs of hands) may be
actinic (solar) keratoses. These are lesions which result from years of overexposure to the sun. They can
be precancerous. Later they may become hard to the touch and grayish or brown in color.
CAUSES—Skin cancer is also called melanoma, or lentigo-maligna melanoma, and appears on body
surfaces which are most frequently exposed to the sunlight: the face, neck, arms, and trunk. It can also
occur on the lips and even eyelids.
The best thing about skin cancer is that it is often slow in spreading and invading the deeper layers of the
skin. As long as the cancer is only on the surface, it can easily be removed.
There are three types of skin cancer; the first two are the most common, and the third is the most
dangerous. Yet all three types can be eliminated if treated early. The medical route or natural methods
can be used to eliminate each of these. But, either way, be sure it is gone. As long as it is treated early,
you can easily see if it is gone.
Basal cell carcinoma: This is the most common type, and the slowest growing. It does not spread until it
has been present for a number of years. It is an ulcer-like growth which spreads very slowly. The first
sign is a large pearly lump, generally on the face, nose, or area around the eyes. About six weeks later it
becomes an ulcer with a moist center and a hard border which may bleed. Scabs continually form, then
drop off, but with no healing of the ulcer. Another form is flat sores which slowly widen. Treatment is
the same as for squamous cell cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma: Due to damage to lower-skin surface, a lump forms on the skin. Looking like
a wart or a nonhealing ulcer, physicians cut it off, freeze it off, chemical it off, or irradiate it off. A skin
graft may be applied afterward.
Melanoma: This is the most dangerous of the three, and can run in families. It often begins as what
appears to be a mole. Most people have moles, but be especially beware of those which appear after the
age of 40. Any mole that is unusual or that changes in size or color should be eliminated. If in doubt, see
a physician!
A melanoma mole arises out of the deeper pigment layer of the skin. For this reason, it spreads more
quickly. Melanomas most frequently occur on the upper back and legs. But they may also occur on
mucous membranes or under the nails.
A fourth type of skin cancer might be noted here. It is the rare mycosis fungoides. For years there will be
itching skin lesions. Eventually they become firm and begin ulcerating. Later they involve the lymph
nodes and produce cancer of the lymph (lymphoma).
Over 600,000 Americans develop skin cancer each year, and 10,000 die of it. More than 90% of skin
cancers can easily be eliminated, if done so early."
disease-general-cancer,Cancer,"TREATMENT
• Cancer is a systemic disease, affecting the entire body and caused by conditions in the
entire person. So it cannot be treated by specifics. An entire change in one's way of life is
required.
For an in depth look at cancer prevention see ""Tumors, Cancer - Part 2"".
For much, much more information on Cancer, see the author's book, Alternate Cancer Therapies
(see order sheet).

SYMPTOMS—The most common symptoms of cancer: any sore that does not heal on the skin, mouth,
tongue, or lips. Any irregular or unusual bleeding or discharge from any body opening. A persistent
change from normal in the action of the bowels or bladder. Any persistent lump or thickening in breast
or anywhere on the body. Hoarseness or nagging cough. Difficulty in swallowing. Persistent indigestion
or loss of appetite, especially if accompanied by loss of weight. Sudden or rapid changes in the form,
appearance, or rate of growth of a mole or wart or if it bleeds. Fatigue.
To the basic eight cancer signs, listed above, we are adding three others which are important: any
condition which does not respond to treatment, inflammation from blood clotting (thrombophlebitis),
and putrid intestinal gas.
Skin cancer: A lump under the skin, moles which change color or size and have raised edges, an ulcer
which does not heal, flat sores, lesions which look like moles.
Mouth or throat: Chronic ulcer of the mouth, tongue, or throat which does not heal.
Larynx: Persistent cough and hoarse throat.
Lung: Persistent cough, bloody sputum, and chest pain.
Breast: Lump which is hard, does not go away, and does not move; inflammation or thickening of the
skin. (See ""Breast Cancer"" for more signs.)
Leukemia: Whiteness of skin, weight loss, fatigue, repeated infections, easy bruising, nosebleeds.
Stomach: Indigestion and pain after eating.
Bladder and Kidney: Blood in urine and increased urination frequency. Bloody urine is generally not a
cancer symptom, but it can be.
Ovaries: Usually there are no obvious symptoms until later stages.
Endometrium: Bleeding between menstrual periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.
Cervical and Uterine: Bleeding between periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.
Prostate: Weak or interrupted urine flow; continuous pain in lower back, pelvis, and/or upper thighs.
Testicles: Enlargement of a testicle, lumps, thickening of scrotum, sudden excess of fluid in scrotum,
mild ache in lower abdomen or groin.
Colon: Blood in stools, rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea and/or constipation).
Lymphoid Tissue: Enlarged, rubbery, lymph nodes; itching; night sweats; unexplained fever and/or
weight loss.
CAUSES—In this article, you will find an overview of many research studies and data.
Cancer is now the second most common killer in the United States and is increasing. One in every three
people will die from some form of it. Over 1,400 Americans die each day with it.
Cancer cells are wild, irregular, and different from other body cells. They grow rapidly and gradually
invade and fill surrounding areas. They rob neighboring cells of nutrition, resulting in a gradual wasting
away of the patient. They can migrate to new locations and multiply. Wherever they go, there are
abnormal growths and tumors.
Cancer cells are classified by the organs they initially invade (liver, breast, colon, lung, lip, etc.). There
are more than 100 different varieties of cancer. Each varies in its symptoms and how fast it spreads.
There are four main types of cancer: Carcinomas affect the skin, mucous membranes, glands, and other
organs. Leukemias are blood cancers. Sarcomas affect muscles, connective tissue, and bones.
Lymphomas affect the lymphatic system.
Early detection and treatment is vital. One person dies every 3 minutes from cancer.
Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner, stated: ""More is known about the cause and prevention of cancer
than most any other disease.""
Dr. Ronald Raven, Chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, said: ""Seventy-five percent
of all cancer can be prevented if we utilize the facts we now possess.""
At the Eighth International Cancer Congress, Dr. Kavetsky said: ""It is essential in the treatment of
tumorous disease, not only to act on the tumor, but to endeavor to strengthen the compensatory and
defensive reaction . . of the entire system.""
When a cancer becomes noticed, it is already far advanced. At this stage, it is important that the one with
it place himself under the care of a competent physician who understands and uses nutritional therapy.
However, the patient needs to understand, for himself, what is required and what he must do. There are
situations in which a cancer victim has no one to help him, and he must carry out such a program
entirely on His own.
But, whether helped by others or going it alone, unless the individual fully cooperates with right
principles, he cannot be successfully helped. He must cease his violations of the natural laws, given by
God to mankind, and live fully in accordance with them.
The type of food we eat, the way we live, and environmental factors gradually build up or weaken the
body. If the organs of elimination cannot keep up with the amount of toxic waste we are producing, in
desperation the body eventually turns to the formation of tumors and cancers. Soft cancers are cells gone
wild because of the excess waste in the system. Hard tumors are garbage cans prepared to hold the toxic
waste.
Cancer generally has a lengthy incubation period of years. Nourishing the body, building up the immune
system, and avoiding excess and debilitating substances enables the body to resist cancer.
Because of intemperate living, eating, sleeping, combined with stress, the body is weakened over the
years. This produces a chronic autointoxication—poisons have accumulated in the body. Vital organs,
whose job it is to purify and eliminate wastes (such as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bowels),
become less active and efficient. The system becomes poisoned. These poisons accumulate around the
weakest organs or where the body has been injured by a bruise, fall, or blow. The accumulated poisons
from years of tea, coffee, tobacco, cola, meat, liquor, fried food, etc., especially accumulate in such an
area. Then the body either tries to build garbage cans (tumors), to hold the waste products or the cells in
that area go wild from the irritation; so cancer cells form and spread. It is well-known that irritation,
such as always picking at a certain spot, can cause cancer.
Unfortunately, there are also toxic substances in the air, water, and soil. This makes it the more crucial
that we live as carefully as we can.
Prevention of cancer requires effort; yet many people give more attention to caring for their prize dogs
or their new cars. The human body requires careful attention also.
Drs. Hans Nieper and Dean Burk stated that, by the time the tumor is present, a patient's malignancy is
already far advanced. As noted earlier, a tumor is something of a strange parasite, which has as little as
2% of normal blood circulation. Its cells are living on sugar fermentation instead of oxygen as normal
cells do. It is more like a plant or fungus.
—Additional causal factors will be noted in Cancer Prevention.
Here are two interesting facts: (1) The U.S. Government declares that the five-year survival rate from
taking the officially authorized cancer remedies (chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation) has not changed
over the past 20 years. (2) Statistics reveal that patients who do not take officially authorized therapy
will, as a group, survive longer than those who do.
A problem with the cut, burn, and poison routes is their deadly nature. Chemotherapy, for example,
produces hair loss, extreme nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, sterility, and damage to the liver,
kidneys, and heart. What should you do? That is your decision. On one hand, you can take the officially
recommended remedies at your local hospital. Or you can try natural remedies. Your choice.
Some of the natural folk remedies are listed here. There are many others.
However, you should know that the government and the medical association advises that you should
never treat yourself for cancer. Their counsel is that you consult a medical doctor (M.D.), and follow his
advice explicitly. Not to do so, they say, could result in your death."
disease-general-leukemia,Leukemia,"TREATMENT
• Treatment may include DMSO IV (which matures the immature cells in circulation),
laetrile, germanium, selenium, vitamin A, and vitamin C to bowel tolerance.
—For information on some of the natural remedies which you may wish to consider, read the sections
on ""Cancer"" and ""Cancer Prevention"".
ENCOURAGEMENT—In Christ we find our hope; in Him we find our salvation. Cry to Him for help
and trust that He will work everything for the best for all concerned. You can safely lean on Him. He
will not fail you, no matter what the outcome.

SYMPTOMS—Weakness, easy fatigue, a remarkable whiteness of the skin, difficulty in breathing,
spells of fever, sweats, palpitation, rapid heart, loss of weight, soreness or ulceration of the throat and
gums, and a tendency to hemorrhage.
In one type, the spleen is enlarged; in another, the lymph glands are also enlarged.
CAUSES—This is called cancer of the blood, but it is actually cancer of the bone marrow, where the
blood is made.
Leukemia (which means ""white blood"") produces a defect in the production of white blood cells,
resulting in large numbers of immature WBCs in the blood stream. WBCs are vital to physical health;
and, without them, the body deteriorates. The bone marrow continues to produce an excess of them; yet
many of those produced and dumped into the blood stream are essentially useless.
A blood test reveals anemia (not enough red blood cells), low platelet count, increased lymphoblasts (an
excess of immature WBCs), and an elevated total WBC count.
Chronic cases run an up and down course for several years. Acute cases generally end fatally in a few
weeks.
As a rule, leukemia ends in death. A person can choose to go the medical route or try natural remedies.
There will, of course, be a risk and the very real possibility of death, whatever his decision may be."
disease-general-leprosy,Leprosy,"TREATMENT
• The disease is almost unknown among vegetarians, but is prevalent among meat eaters,
especially in hot tropical climates.
• The worst things to take into your body are pork, crocodile meat, lard, blood, greasy
meats, coffee, alcohol, or tobacco.
• Cleanly living is important.
• In tropical countries, chaulmoogra oil is taken. Begin by swallowing 10 drops a day,
gradually increasing to 30 if the person can tolerate it.
• Sunbathing helps.
• Helpful herbs include red clover blossoms, burdock seeds, yellow dock root, lobelia, red
root, poke root, goldenseal, myrrh, bittersweet, sassafras, poplar bark, black cherry bark,
and comfrey.
—Leprosy closely resembles syphilis and tuberculosis, so you may wish to read those articles also.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Find in God the help that you so much need. He can help you, day by day.
Giving your life to Him is the best thing you can do. Whatever the outcome, He has your life in Hands.
And that is the best way to have it.

Tumors, Cancer
Part 2
Cancer Prevention

SYMPTOMS—Any unnatural patch on the surface of the skin. If void of sensibility to temperature,
pain, or touch, it should be a warning of the possible onset of this disease. Other early symptoms include
headache, nosebleed, and fevers. Certain areas may become insensitive, because the disease follows
along nerve trunks and especially affects areas on, or close to, the skin.
CAUSES—Leprosy is a strange infectious disease, caused by a bacteria which, under a microscope,
looks like tuberculosis. It is mildly contagious.
There may be 2-3 years, and sometimes much longer, after exposure before symptoms appear. Once it
appears, it develops very slowly."
disease-general-special-risk-factors,Special Risk Factors,"Here are the special risk factors for each of the fifteen main types of cancer:
Skin—Exposure to the sun, especially for those who have fair skin; history of moles (malignant or
otherwise); moles on the feet or in areas irritated by clothing; scars from severe burns and scars or sores
that won't heal; family history of skin cancer.
Lung—Smoking; exposure to asbestos, chromates, nickel, or radioactive materials; history of
tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis; exposure to certain chemicals, such as pesticides and herbicides.
Breast—First childbirth after age 35; having no children; family history of cancer; high alcohol and/or
caffeine intake; high-fat diet; diabetes. Estrogens and oral contraceptives have been linked to breast and
uterine cancer. There appears to be a link between sugar intake in older women and breast cancer.
Stomach—Pernicious anemia; lack of hydrochloric acid and dietary fiber; high-fat diet; chronic
gastritis; stomach polyps.
Colon—Lack of dietary fiber and calcium; polyps; family history of colon cancer; continued
constipation and/or diarrhea; a buildup of toxins in the colon; a high-fat diet.
Leukemia—Hereditary factors; radiation exposure; chronic viral infections.
Cervical and uterine—More than 5 complete pregnancies; first intercourse before age 18; a history of
gonorrhea or genital warts; multiple sex partners; infertility.
Ovarian—Not having had children; high-fat diet.
Laryngeal—Heavy smoking; alcohol consumption.
Lymphoma—Hereditary factors; immune system dysfunction. Some cases are linked to a viral cause.
Mouth and throat—Use of chewing tobacco; smoking; irritants inside the mouth, such as a broken or
sharp tooth, or ill-fitting or broken dentures; excessive alcohol intake.
Endometrial—Never having been pregnant; being past menopause; family history of cancer; diabetes;
obesity; hypertension.
Bladder and kidney—Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzidines, aniline dyes, napthalenes;
smoking; excessive consumption of caffeine and/or artificial sweeteners; history of schistosomiasis (a
tropical disease); frequent urinary tract infections.
Testicular—Undescended testicle.
Prostate—Recurring prostate infection; history of venereal disease; diet high in animal fat; high intake
of milk, meat, and/or coffee; use of male hormone (testosterone) in treatment of impotence; vasectomy;
being over age 50."
disease-general-miscellaneous-preventative-factors,Miscellaneous Preventative Factors,"• Venereal disease can lead to breast, cervical, uterine, and prostate cancer.
• The following can also lead to cancer: too much sunlight (skin cancer); mechanical, physical, or
chemical irritation; prolonged irritation of warts, pimples, or sores (skin cancer); and radiation
(leukemia).
• The clothes should have no constricting bands and should keep the neck, head, arms, legs, and feet
warm. As many layers of clothing should be worn on the extremities as are worn on the trunk. This is
especially important in cancer of the breast or skin.
• A biopsy is a thin slice of tissue, taken to examine it for possible carcinoma (cancer). But, when the
slice is made, the cancer (if any) stored in that area, can immediately begin spreading throughout the
body.
• X-ray, radium, and other forms of radiation therapy, along with chemotherapy, weaken the body
and intensifies the toxicity and weakened conditions initially producing the cancer. The cancer generally
returns with 6 to 12 months in greatly strengthened form.
• Here is a brief list of some of the significant factors leading to cancer: Chemical additives in food,
refined and fragmented food, use of nicotine and/or alcohol, a heavy protein diet, excessive use of
dairy products, commercial oils and fats (especially when heated and reheated), all grease,
hydrogenated oil (added to many foods), diethylstilbestrol, hormones, contraceptives, nitrates
(often added to food), medicinal drugs, hard drugs, monosodium glutamate (in food and tobacco),
refined sugars, saccharin and other artificial sweeteners, biopsies and other forms of surgery,
pollutants (occupational and environmental), X-rays and radium exposure, cosmetics, detergents
and soaps, water (chlorinated, fluoridated, or contaminated), and aluminum."
disease-general-general-preventative-factors,General Preventative Factors,"• Jethro Kloss said that his cancer cure was correct food, herbs, water, fresh air, massage, sunshine,
exercise, and rest. Yet some famous medical dictionaries say nothing about diet in cancer treatment,
except to keep the diet under 2,000 calories. The truth is there is a close relationship between the food
we eat and what happens in our bodies.
• Meals, bedtime, periods of study, etc. should be according to a regular schedule. Avoid noise, smog,
television, worry, stress, and confusion. Do some reading every day. Reading in God's Word,
accompanied by simple trustful prayer brings healing to heart, soul, and body.
• Dr. Josef Issels' cancer clinic, in Germany, is an example of a well-rounded program. In addition to
other things mentioned in this book, he prescribes plenty of rest, complete freedom from worries and
mental stress, and plenty of fresh, pure air day and night. To the degree the patient is strong enough
for it, and as he improves, there is lots of exercise and walking.
• Some, in a position to do so, may wish to move to a warm, unpolluted climate (any left?) where fresh
air and sunshine is continually available. Build up the system with good food, exercise, and rest.
• Continual overwork and exhaustion can lay the groundwork for the development of cancer.
• City living, with its hurry, noise, confusion, and air and water pollution, can also provide the
inferior living conditions which lead to malignant conditions.
WORRY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS
• Stress is also considered a significant factor. More and more research indicates that, as Dr. H.F.
Dunbar says, ""only certain types of people succumb to cancer.""
• Two Soviet researchers (Serov and Troskin) demonstrated that negative emotions reduce the white
blood count in an alarming manner, hindering a major body defense against disease.
• Researchers at the Rochester Medical Center in New York have found that people are more likely to
contract cancer if, more than others, they have a harder time dealing with severe emotional conflicts
and stresses, have uncontrolled anxieties and worries, experience traumatic emotional experiences
or losses, have strong feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, hopelessness, and desperation. It may not
be that such negative attitudes cause the cancer, but they keep the person from resisting and conquering
it.
• Maintain a strong sense of purpose. Find something to do with yourself. In one church which the
author once pastored, a woman bedridden for years before her death would phone people at random and
encourage and pray with them. Between calls, she would pray for them. She was a radiant sunbeam.
• A strong trust in God and peace in Him is the solution. Man innately knows that he cannot solve his
own problems; he needs God! Only in Him can we find the strength and courage to press forward. Only
then can we be genuinely happy amid life's problems.
• Read God's Inspired Word—the Bible—every day, and be happy, contented, thankful, and
helpful to others. This is a powerful inducer to healthful conditions in the body."
disease-general-deep-breathing-and-exercise,Deep Breathing And Exercise,"• Cancer is less prevalent in physically active people, so exercise is important.
• Obtain plenty of exercise. Fresh air has remarkable healing, strengthening properties. God gave it to
us for a purpose. Let it cleanse the lungs, purify your blood, and tone up your organs.
• Do deep breathing exercises. Take 20 deep breaths, hold each one for several seconds, and then
slowly exhale. Exhale to full compression, and then inhale again. Do this several times a day—always
outdoors. This, along with outdoor walking, will help clean the lungs.
• Soviet scientists demonstrated that a complex link exists between cancer and not breathing deeply
enough or breathing stale air too much. One researcher in the Western world said that forced deep
breathing, out of doors, at least 3 times a day to the point of dizziness, will help furnish an ample supply
of oxygen.
• It is well-known that cancer cannot live in an oxygen-rich environment.
• (Many researchers seem not to be aware of the negative ion factor. Breathing deeply out of doors
supplies both oxygen and negative ions to the body. Negative ions provide a much-needed electric
charge needed by the nerves.)
• If at all possible, sleep in a room that receives sunlight during the day. It has been scientifically
proven that patients' rooms on the north side of a building have more disease germs on the floor and
furnishings.
• The bedroom should be properly ventilated at all times."
disease-general-organs-of-elimination,Organs Of Elimination,"• Keep the eliminative organs active. The five primary ones are the lungs, the skin, the liver, the
kidneys, and the bowels. Add to this a sixth: the lymphatic system. Add to that a seventh: the immune
system, working together with the white blood cells, the T-cells, and vitamin C. (Vitamin E also purifies
and detoxifies, but it carries on this function in the liver.)
• The first step is to cleanse the blood by relieving constipation, making all the organs of elimination
active, and keeping them active. Take herbal laxatives or enemas.
• A daily bowel movement is essential, even if an enema or colonic is required. All foods which
ferment in the bowel should be avoided. Absolutely no meat or fish!
• Bowel movements need to be complete evacuations, even if enemas are necessary. The cleansing
program is releasing so many toxins, it is important that they be flushed out. Enough water must be
drunk every day.
• If necessary, keep the bowels clean with herbal laxatives or enemas. When the body is toxic, the
bowels become sluggish; waste matter is reabsorbed by the blood and lymphatic system, which is
circulated throughout the body and stored in tumors or other trash sites. It is best that you not use these
over a long period of time.
• Many aspects of cancer therapy, including chemo and radiation therapy, pain killers and sedatives,
reduce muscular contractions in the intestines, resulting in constipation. Sometimes physical assistance
is needed. Using the flat side of your fist, gently massage with rocking motions, pushing about 1-2
inches. Be gentle and slow! This not only helps reduce constipation, but increases muscle tone."
disease-general-chemical-food-additives,Chemical Food Additives,"• Coal tar dyes are highly carcinogenic. All artificial colors, flavors, and odors are made from coal
tar. You will find them in all soft drinks, cosmetics, and many medicines. Foods which have bright
colors, strong flavors, or odors often have coal tar in them. (The FDA lists thousands of approved food
additives. The more natural and unprocessed the food is, the less likely it is to have additives. Junk foods
are the worst.)
• Research has shown that cyclamates, an artificial sweetener, will in later years cause cancer of the
stomach and other digestive organs. Ditto for saccharin.
• Food additives like MSG, BHT, BHA, DES, and others are poisons. Read the labels carefully. Keep
in mind that many harmful food additives are not listed on the labels because the FDA considers them to
be ""Generally Regarded as Safe"" Those chemicals you will find in the FDA GRAS List. But that does
not mean they are safe!
• Diethylstilbestrol (Des) has been shown by the FDA to cause cancer of the uterus, breast and other
reproductive organs. This is an artificial sex hormone widely used in food production. Dangerous
residues of stilbestrol are in 85% of all the meat sold in the United States. This is the main reason why
15 countries around the world now refuse to import American meat; 21 nations have a total ban on the
use of stilbestrol in food production or processing.
• Nitrosamines cause cancer of the liver, stomach, brain, bladder, kidneys and several other organs. Dr.
William Lijinski, of the University of Nebraska, says they are ""perfect carcinogens."" When chemical
preservatives and color enhancers are ingested, they cause the body to produce nitrosamines. Another
source is nitrates and nitrites, which are heavily added to meat during processing. Runoff of nitrates and
nitrites from fields sprayed with chemical fertilizers get into aquifers and wells and, when the water is
drunk, can lead to cancer.
• Yes, aluminum cookware is a type of ""food additive!"" Throw it all away. It is poisonous to your
body. It is outlawed in Sweden; outlaw it in your kitchen. Aluminum is a poison, and also a relatively
soft metal. Particles of it gradually melt into the food you are cooking. That is why it remains so shiny
inside!
• Use only stainless steel or glassware for cooking.
• Be very careful that you rinse all the soap off your dishes and pots, or you will have added an
additional chemical ""food additive"" to your next meal."
disease-general-other-chemicals,Other Chemicals,"• Avoid chemicals such as hair sprays, all other aerosol products, fresh paints, garden pesticides,
cleaning compounds and waxes, insecticide strips, mothballs and crystals, etc. Anything unnatural.
• Dr. Max Gerson would not allow his cancer patients to dye their hair while recovering from cancer.
• Old-fashioned soap is all you need to disinfect, but when hexachlorophene is added to that soap, the
soap becomes more deadly. Widely used in maternity and other hospital wards, as well as in cosmetics
and deodorants, ""hex"" is a powerful cancer producer.
• Chemicals encourage the formation of free radicals in the body, which may lead to cancer. Do not be
around or use chemicals. The body has to work to throw off the chemicals, when it should be attacking
the cancer cells.
• Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzidines, aniline dyes, and napthalenes, tends to promote
development of bladder and kidney cancer.
• Exposure to asbestos, nickel, chromates, pesticides, herbicides, and radioactive materials induces
lung cancer.
• Aflatoxins (found especially in peanuts and soy sauce) must be avoided.
• Avoid amines (which are in cheese, meat, and unrefrigerated foods).
• Antibiotics predispose to cancer. This would include tetracycline, penicillin, aspirin, diuretics,
immunosuppressants, Azolid, Butazolidin, Presamine, Tofranil, Sk-Promine, Tapazole, Methotrexate,
antihistamines, amphetamines, Atromids, etc.
• Aspirin inhibits lymphocytes (white blood cells) which are crucially needed in immunological
defenses.
• No medicinal drugs ever healed anything; it is nature which heals. Drugs are given to shock the body
into healing itself. A poison is introduced, and this rouses the body to a supreme effort to throw off the
poison. The result is generally a weakening of body organs, a transfer of the site of disease to a different
location, and sometimes a smothering of symptoms—till a later, more deadly, form emerges.
• The taking of birth control pills, estrogen, and other female hormones is damaging to the body. A
later result can be cancer. One anticancer physician (Gerson) found that the only cancer patients he
could not recover were those who were taking hormones or who had damaged livers.
• The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported (May 1972) that pregnant women who take hormones can result
in cancer in their daughters when they enter their teens. The rate of leukemia rate is highest in affluent
areas, where medical help can be afforded and lowest among poorer people.
• City living is depressing. It is also unhealthful. The carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and
other photochemical pollutants in city smog definitely cause cancer of the lungs. Smog is somewhat
present in rural areas, but the thickest in the cities where it is especially produced.
• Automobile exhausts and phosphate fertilizers produce cadmium. This trace mineral is very toxic in
larger amounts and produces various diseases, including cancer. Cadmium is concentrated in animal
livers and shellfish. Avoid both of them."
disease-general-radiation,Radiation,"• Radiation is a cause of leukemia.
• You may be thin and need an electric blanket. But avoid them if you can. There is the possibility that
they might impose an electrical current on the body. That can happen the easiest if your skin is sweaty
and directly next to the blanket. Research also indicates that it is changes in currents from blankets
which may be the most deleterious.
• X-rays, even diagnostic ones (the types used by dentists and physicians) can lead to later leukemia or
other cancers.
• Strontium 90 and Iodine 131 are radioactive element fallouts from distant nuclear bomb tests. Both
are especially found in milk products. The first causes bone cancer and leukemia; the second causes
thyroid cancer.
• Stay eight or more feet from television sets. Because of possible leakage, do not use microwave
ovens.
WHAT ABOUT SUNLIGHT?
• Nearly all physicians and nutritionists agree today that sunlight is harmful, even dangerous. But is this
really true?
• It is not easy to arrive at clear-cut answers in this debate, but certain facts should be mentioned:
• First, some sunlight on your skin is extremely important as a purifying agent. An entire book has been
written about the physical benefits of obtaining some sunlight on your body.
• Second, you need some sunlight in order to obtain enough vitamin D for your bones. The oils just
below the surface layers of skin are irradiated by sunlight and vitamin D is produced.
• Third, the author of that special book, Sunlight, by Zane Kime, M.D., is the recognized world authority
on the subject—and in a special section on cancer, he provides 25 pages of detailed information about
suntans in relation to skin cancer.
• Kime declares that sunlight does not cause skin cancer, if the diet is correct! Here, briefly, are several
of his points:
• Sunlight can change cholesterol near the skin surface into free radicals, which can cause cancer. But a
good diet will eliminate the free radicals.
• A high-fat diet increases the likelihood of skin cancer. This includes too much oil of any kind in the
diet—grease, hydrogenated oil, trans-fat, and vegetable oil.
• Trans-fat (fat which is not polyunsaturated) stops oxygen utilization by the cell, and leads to cancer.
Liquid vegetable oil can be up to 6% trans-fat, margarines up to 54%, and solid shortening up to 58%.
• If you are on a low-fat diet, sunlight hitting your skin actually inhibits cancer."
disease-general-protein,Protein,"• Our actual daily protein requirement is 20-30 grams a day, but many eat over 100 a day. Almonds,
well-chewed, are a good protein source for those recovering from cancer. Brewer's yeast is also.
• Proteins should be in the form of seeds and nuts. Almonds are excellent, so are sesame and sunflower
seeds. Chew them well. Eat 10 raw almonds daily. They are high in laetrile, an anticancer agent
(although not as high as apricot seeds).
• Do not eat peanuts. Limit, but do not eliminate soybean products. Soybeans contain enzyme
inhibitors, so are not the best until you are well.
• Eat all concentrated protein at only two meals (breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner). Do not eat
them at the third meal. In this way there are no proteins being digested for a 15-hour period, and the
pancreatic enzymes are able to focus their attention on digesting cancer cells present in everyone.
• Overeating on protein leaves no extra pancreatic enzymes to digest cancer cells throughout the body.
• Make sure you have enough hydrochloric acid, so the protein you do eat is being properly absorbed."
disease-general-meat,Meat,"• Avoid meat in all forms. It is dead matter, low in minerals, and produces uric acid in excess which is a
waste product. The incidence of cancer is in direct proportion to the amount of animal proteins,
particularly meat, in the diet.
• However it is true that devitalized, processed, and sugared food can also cause cancer—even in
vegetarians. But far more often, when cancer strikes, those eating the junk foods are also eating meat.
• Nations and groups which consume less meat have less cancer. Hospital records show that Seventh-day
Adventists, who eat little or no meat, suffer far less from cancer than the average meat-eating American.
Dr. Willard J. Visek, research scientist at Cornell University, stated that the high protein diet of
Americans is linked to the high incidence of cancer in the U.S.
• Another cancer physician, who also worked with hundreds of cancer patients, said that anyone who
does not eat meat, eats only good food, and does all he can to protect his liver, may never get cancer.
• Cancer is less a disease than a condition existing in the whole body. Cancer would be almost unheard
of if no devitalized food or meats were eaten. Cancer cannot exist where there is a pure bloodstream."
disease-general-dairy-products,Dairy Products,"• Do not eat animal protein. Never eat luncheon meat, hot dogs, or smoked or cured meats. Restrict
consumption of dairy products.
• Milk and milk products are harmful, so they should be avoided. Milk contains a growth hormone for
growing calves large in a few weeks and months. It will stimulate tumor growth. The pasteurization of
milk destroys the phosphatase enzyme needed for assimilation, and many allergies and digestive
problems result. Calves fed on pasteurized milk die of heart attacks in 8 months, yet we still give it to
our children.
• The synthetic vitamin D added to milk is one of the most toxic food additives known. Some of it
unites with undigested calcium, forming calcified deposits which can be focal points for developing
tumors.
• Those with cancer should not use milk, with the possible exception of two tablespoons of yogurt daily.
• Eggs can cause cancer. Many chickens die of carcinoma (cancer). It is known that the cancer germ can
pass from the chicken into the egg."
disease-general-fats-and-rancid-oil,Fats And Rancid Oil,"• Keep the weight down. Obesity is another factor linked to cancer, especially in women. Overweight
women more frequently have cancer of the uterus, and do not recover as easily from breast cancer.
• Accumulated fatty tissue in the body affects female hormones. The more that is present, the more
estrogen is produced and converted into a special type of endocrine substance which stimulates cells to
divide in the breast and reproductive system. Overweight men and women are more likely to develop
cancer.
• A high-fat diet dramatically increases the occurrence of colon, breast, endometrium, and ovarian
cancer, as compared with a low-fat diet. Eating a lot of fat encourages the development of cancer in both
men and women. Colon cancer is more likely to occur in men.
• Those who eat the most saturated fat are twice as likely to develop polyps.
• Dr. Ott Warburg, made that discovery in the 1920s. He demonstrated that the metabolism of cancerous
tissue differs radically from that of normal tissue. A regular cell is nourished by oxygen which it uses to
break down nutriments; without oxygen it dies. But a cancer cell lives by using chemicals to break down
nutriments—not oxygen—and needs little or no oxygen to exist. The tumor, being a parasite, has a
restricted circulation of blood, sometimes as low as 2% of normal, hence it lives on fermentation of
sugar, like a plant or fungus, instead of oxygen. Later experiments by Warburg revealed that normal
living tissue will become cancerous, if deprived of oxygen. It was this research which brought Warburg
the Nobel Prize.
• Since the blood provides the cells with oxygen, Warburg concluded that the condition of the
bloodstream played an important part in the development of cancer. This is substantiated by the fact
that malignant tumors are frequently found near scars, at the sides of ulcers, in atrophied organs, or
wherever the blood supply is poor.
• Rancid oils and heavy protein diets thicken the blood, and weaken its ability to transport food and
oxygen to the cells.
• Unlike other cells, cancer cells do not need oxygen. Rancid oils and fats are dangerous, for they
decrease oxygenation and weaken normal cells while strengthening cancerous ones.
• Rancid food and oils are unsafe and can produce cancer. Even health foods which have been on the
shelf (not refrigerated) for too long can be rancid. Try to make sure that the wheat germ, wheat germ
oil, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flaxseed oil, and whole wheat flour are fresh. Natural,
unprocessed foods are extremely perishable. Refrigerate as soon as possible after purchasing them.
Wheat germ is a special problem; it turns rancid a week after it is made. Vitamins E, A, and F are
totally destroyed in rancid foods. During the process of turning rancid, very harmful chemicals, such as
peroxides, are produced. Because they are strong chemical irritants, after being ingested they can cause
cancer. Research on this was done in Germany by Dr. H. Anemueller, and, in the University of
Pennsylvania, by Drs. Rownee and Barrett.
• Heated fats (animal or vegetable), when heated to a high temperature, become carcinogenic. Never
fry food, never eat fried food. Instead add no oil to your cooking, but place measured amounts on your
food after it is served at the table. In this way, you will be better able to control your oil intake.
• Oil in the coffee bean turns rancid when heated; do not drink coffee because of that and several other
reasons. Coffee has been shown to produce cancer of the bladder."
disease-general-diet-and-nutrition,Diet And Nutrition,"• Researchers in Sweden estimate that 40% of cancer in males and 60% in females is caused by dietary
deficiencies and wrong eating.
• Chew your food four times as long, thus making it four times as digestible. Cancer is often caused by
mineral deficiencies. How can you get enough, if you are not chewing your food properly? When you
chew your food well, you do not need to eat as much to satisfy both hunger and body needs.
• As noted elsewhere, do not use dairy products, fried foods, heavy starches, or high protein foods.
Keep the diet simple and use cleansing foods.
* Rats fed simple, natural food were far less likely to develop cancer than rats fed ""purified"" foods (i..e,
processed foods).
• Do not eat tainted or partly-spoiled food: fruits, vegetables, grains, etc. Definitely do not eat spoiled
protein foods (such as nuts)!"
disease-general-cooking,Cooking,"• Modern food processing, canning, and cooking destroys enzymes vital to digestion and body needs.
When food is heated to 106o F., some of these enzymes are damaged; many are destroyed when 120o F.
is reached. Try to keep foods, which have been subjected to heat, to below 25% of the diet. Too much
cooked foods throw an extra burden on the pancreas. It must try to produce additional enzymes to
detoxify that cooked food, which tries to produce a normal output of the same enzymes used throughout
the body to destroy cancer cells.
• When you do cook, measure the water and keep track of the time needed to cook the food—so that
you will know exactly when to turn off the fire, and there is only a very small amount of water
remaining in the pot. Then be sure and drink that water.
• It has been reported that cancer which has been controlled, starts returning if over 25% of the food is
cooked and processed. This is probably due to the extra demand on the pancreas to replace enzymes
destroyed by heat. This paragraph is worth remembering later on.
• Cook all sprouts slightly to eliminate a certain enzyme. But do not heat alfalfa sprouts; eat them raw."
disease-general-problem-foods,Problem Foods,"• Eliminate fats, salted foods, fried foods, smoked foods, pickles, soft drinks, caffeine, alcohol,
chocolate, and all processed, fried, and junk foods from the diet.
• A high alcohol and/or caffeine intake is cause of breast cancer. The use of alcohol or tobacco leads to
cancer of the larynx. Smokeless tobacco produces cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, and throat. Smoking
cigarettes or cigars produces lung cancer and is a factor in bladder and kidney cancer.
• Do not eat too much salt. Research in Japan disclosed that the frequency of stomach cancer is
definitely related to the quantity of salt eaten.
• Caffeine also interferes with production of those enzymes.
• Cancerous tumors require sugar in order to grow. Older women who use generous amounts of sugar
are much more likely to contract breast cancer. Do not use any cane sugar products, such as cake, pie,
jelly, ice cream, candy, etc.
• In animal studies, progressive increase in sucrose in the diet leads to a dose-dependent decline in
antibody production.
• An epidemiological study of 21 countries revealed that high sugar intake is a major risk factor toward
breast cancer.
• Artificial sweeteners are cancer-causing drugs.
• Do not use China tea (the regular tea you buy in the grocery store); it contains tannic acid. Only use
herbal teas.
• Some natural-remedy cancer therapists say never use tomatoes at all, if you have cancer. There is
something about tomatoes that tend to aggravate the situation for those with active cancer.
• Others say that those with cancer can eat tomatoes by themselves, not with other foods. Some say it is
all right to make a meal of them if you wish—eaten alone. Some say they can be eaten with fresh-baked
zwieback (bread which has then been toasted in the oven until it is hard and chewy). Probably the best
decision is avoid tomatoes entirely if you have a malignancy.
• Do not take supplemental iron tablets. The body tries to withhold iron from cancer cells, because the
inorganic iron helps the cancer grow. People with excess iron levels in the blood tend to have an
increased risk of developing cancer, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Excess iron
suppresses the cancer-killing function of the macrophages and interfere with T- and B-cell activity. The
richest source of good iron is blackstrap molasses.
• Cancer thrives on glucose. They produce a 3- to 5-fold increase in glucose uptake compared to healthy
cells. Studies of cancer patients revealed that they tended to eat more sugar than healthy people. It was
also found that high sugar intake increases the likelihood breast cancer.
• Simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose [white sugar]) honey, and orange juice significantly
impaired the capacity of neutrophils to engulf bacteria, but starch ingestion did not have this effect.
However, you still need simple sugars, so eat them in moderation."
disease-general-good-foods,Good Foods,"• The average Westerner eats 1,500 pounds of food per year. The food we eat is an important factor in
health or degeneration. Only nutritious foods should be eaten, and in moderation.
• Overeating is associated in 35% of all cancers.
• One group of mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted (about 3 g per day); the other was
restricted to 2 g. Over half the mice on the unrestricted diet developed cancer after 90 weeks. Later
experiments repeated this result, producing all types of tumors (lung, liver, skin, etc.). In every
experiment, the more the diet is restricted in calories, the less incidence of cancerous growths.
• Carotenoids and bioflavonoids are both free radical protectors. Both stimulate the immune system,
while there is evidence that carotenoids may be directly toxic to tumor cells. Carotenoids are the yellow
coloring matter in green and yellow vegetables. Deep green leafy vegetables and fresh carrot juice are
the best sources. Bioflavonoids are found in citrus, whole grains, honey, and other plant foods.
• Animals fed cruciferous vegetables had markedly lower cancer rates matched controls. This family of
vegetables includes broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. Of them, broccoli has been
found to be the best. Since that 1970 discovery the University of Minnesota, the active ingredient, called
indoles, have been isolated from the vegetables is provides unusual protection against cancer. Scientists
at Johns Hopkins found that lab animals fed cruciferous vegetables, and then exposed to the deadly
carcinogen aflatoxin, had a 90 percent reduction in cancer rates.
• Greens and the green foods have every known vitamin, except Vitamin D and, possibly, B12. In
addition, they have high levels of beta-carotene, potassium, glutathione (an amino acid) and other crucial
nutrients which reduce tumor growth.
• A diet high in beta-carotene, especially beta-carotene, has been found to protect against cancer
(International Journal of Cancer, September 1984).
• Green powders, such as Greenlife, Barley Green, etc., are invaluable. Eat a spoonful with your food or
in juice.
• Emphasize raw food to the degree you are able to do so. It is best that most of the food be raw,
especially fruits and green leafy vegetables.
• Phytosterols are natural chemicals in plants which reduce the risk of colon cancer.
• Abscisic acid is a plant dormancy hormone and vitamin A analog found in plants; it has profound anti-
cancer activity. Abscisic acid is a carotenoid factor and is especially found in green leafy vegetables.
• While cleaning the body (such as during a fast), breakfast can consist of fresh fruit and fruit juices. Use
lemon, orange, grape, carrot, beet, and apple juice daily. All juices should be fresh, with no sugar
added.
• But in other foods, a small amount of blackstrap molasses, pure maple syrup, or honey can act as a
natural sweetener in place of sugar.
• Use whole wheat or rye in place of white flour. Whole grain products, well-baked, are good. Do not
use sourdough bread, sugared bread, or fruit breads. They are too indigestible.
• Raw fruit and vegetables are best; lightly cooked or steamed are second best. Salt-free frozen are
next. Then comes salt-free canned; but such food should only be used if the first three choices are not
available.
• Raw fruit and vegetable juices are needed to clean the system and help rebuild it. Use red beet juice
(from roots and very little if any from tops) and juice from carrots, celery, grapes, and other
darker vegetables and fruits, such as black cherries, black currants, etc.
• Fruit juices are best taken in the morning and vegetable juices in the afternoon and evening.
• Drink spring or steam-distilled water only!
• Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer researcher, uses fresh raw cabbage and carrot juice with excellent results.
• Some recommend four 8-ounce glasses of freshly squeezed juice daily. Max Gerson, M.D., prescribed
13 glassfuls a day. Along with a scientific program of other remedies, that juice pattern is still followed
today at the Gerson Institute in northern Mexico.
• Never mix fruit and vegetable juices in the same meal. It is all right to mix vegetables juices
together, but do not mix fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, or grape). Some (including
the Gerson Institute) recommend a combination of carrot and apple juice.
• Fresh lemon juice should be squeezed on all greens, salads, or lettuce that are eaten. This enables the
calcium and minerals to be better absorbed by the system. Dark green vegetables are better than light-
colored lettuce.
• Lecithin should be included in the diet to keep cholesterol in the blood stream emulsified (so it does
not harden on the walls). This will improve blood circulation to the site of the tumor. Lecithin helps
regulate metabolism, break down fat and cholesterol, and prevent malignancies.
• Wheat germ oil is an extremely rich source of vitamin E, and should be taken daily. Only use cold-
pressed (Viobin), and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to use it during the meal.
• Omega-3 fatty acids may inhibit cancers, especially breast cancer (Cancer, October 1986). Flaxseed
oil is, by far, the best source!
• According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate amount of
essential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancer. It even helps eliminate them, once they
form.
• Take a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses at the end of the vegetable meal. This will provide additional
amounts of iron, calcium, and important B vitamins.
• Never eat fruit and vegetables at the same meals. Exception: lemon juice can be squeezed over
greens to help you better absorb and calcium and minerals in those greens.
• Use plenty of soaked figs, prunes and raisins.
• Eat garlic daily. Studies done in Japan suggest that taking garlic supplements may help reduce the size
of tumors. It has been used for medicinal purposes for 4,000 years.
• Garlic is a faithful standby, and protects against cancer in general (Acta Unio. Intern. Contra
Cancrum, 20 no. 3, 1964). Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you consider might
be, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If it does, the skin will redden and
burn somewhat.) Russian research from back in the 1950s revealed that garlic is more powerful than
antibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also causes moles and skin cancers to fall off.
Put the garlic on in the morning, take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening before bedtime.
Put on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the process. Do this for about 3 days.
The mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the area heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process
at a later time.
If you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the skin (you will
know, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not necessary to slough off the
cancer, and could be harmful.
• Be sure to incorporate dietary fiber in each regular meal.
• Fiber in the diet helps maintain regularity and avoid colon cancer. But it also helps the colon absorb
toxins and carry it out of the body. This is important. Be sure to eat at least 3 tablespoons of bran at each
regular (non-juice only) meal.
• Try to have a vegetable, fruit, and berry garden of your own, using natural fertilizers, seaweed, etc.
You are what you eat. Purchase food where organically-grown food is sold.
• We do not generally think of mushrooms as the best food, for they are in the fungus family. But it has
been found that three types (Reishi, Shiitake, and Maitake mushrooms) have decided anti-cancer
factors. Oral extract of Maitake provided complete elimination of tumors in 40% of test animals, while
the remaining 60% had a 90% of their cancers eliminated. Maitake contains a polysaccharide, called
beta-glucan, which stimulates the immune system and even lowers blood pressure.
• Legumes and seed foods (such as soybeans) have protease inhibitors (PI). These tend to protect the
seeds from being digested. As such, they were thought to be a problem. But recently it has been
discovered that they tend to reduce tumor growth. The National Cancer Institute that some of these
substances (isoflavones and phytoestrogens) have potent anti-cancer properties. However, eating a lot of
beans is not something you will want to do at home! Too much protein helps feed the cancer cells.
• Certain other foods show an ability to slow tumor growth in some way. This includes apples, apricots,
barley, citrus fruit, cranberries, fiber, figs, ginger, spinach, and seaweed.
• There are a variety of digestive enzymes. Take them with a meal to improve digestion, or on an empty
stomach if the need is to help fight cancer (first thing in the morning, an hour before breakfast; or the
last thing at night, at least two hours after supper.)
• Rice bran, pressure cooked, is rich in tocotrienols. (2-3 tablespoons a day).
• Aloe vera extract (or, better, fresh aloe vera leaves) contains the active immune stimulant ace mannan.
• Scientists have found that the active culture of bacteria in yogurt (lactobacillus) can fortify the
immune system. In both humans and animals, yogurt in the diet tripled the internal production of
interferon, a powerful chemical compound used by the immune system against cancer cells. It also slows
the level of natural killer cells. Yogurt slows the growth of tumor cells in the gastro-intestinal tract,
while improving the ability of the immune system to destroy active tumor cells. It also helps block the
production of carcinogenic agents in the colon. Women eating yogurt were found to have less breast
cancer. It is well-known that milk is one of the worst allergenic foods, and can carry disease germs from
the cows. So you would do well to obtain lactobacillus cultures from health food stores, rather than
eating yogurt.
• Other intestinal microflora products can be used, instead of yogurt (which can be allergenic and
contain cow diseases). Some broad spectrum products contain lactobacillus, bifidus, streptococcus
faecium. Others contain only lactobacillus, which is milk- and yogurt-free."
disease-general-vitamins,Vitamins,"IMPORTANT: Throughout this study, when dosage amounts used in research are given, the amounts are
always for ""per day"" (mg per day, etc.) G means grams, not grains.
IMPORTANT: According to the literature surveyed, when overdosage was possible, this was indicated.
(See vitamins A, B6, niacin, selenium, cysteine, arginine.) Of course, vitamin D overdose can also be
toxic, but it is not listed here as an anti-cancer factor. For a variety of reasons, beware of taking much, if
any, iron supplements.
IMPORTANT: Fish oils have also been recommended in the literature as possible anti-cancer agents. But
we do not list them here for three reasons: Large amounts must be consumed to be beneficial. Fish oil
has a known history of damaging the muscle of the heart. Some forms inhibit blood clotting
Take the supplements, which seem distasteful and hard to swallow, and put them in a fruit or other drink
and swallow them all together. If necessary, briefly whiz the mixture in a blender.
When possible, chew the tablets. Break open the capsules and pour the powder onto your food or into a
spoon. Crack liquid capsules in your mouth, and spit out the capsule. Do not crack vitamin C in your
mouth—the acidity can hurt your teeth. Just swallow it whole.
• It is well-known, by biochemists, that most cancer victims have a deficiency of not only all vitamins,
but also hydrochloric acid, potassium, magnesium, iodine, and many trace elements.
• Vitamins are very important. Do not trust yourself to the official standardized amounts of needed
vitamins and minerals. The actual nutritional requirements are much higher. In addition, living in our
chemicalized, polluted age destroys a number of vitamins and minerals.
• For example, vitamin C is destroyed in its effort to combat auto exhaust fumes and mercury in the
food. Vitamin E destroys itself in the process of detoxifying cadmium (which nonsmokers breath in
when they are in the same room as smokers). The list goes on and on. The world is not as safe now as it
used to be. We can be thankful that we are aware of vitamins and minerals and how to obtain them in
sufficient quantities.
[Special note: The following data on vitamin A was compiled from information gleaned from sources
which had not yet discovered that beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) was the more active agency in cancer
prevention, and far more powerful than vitamin A.]
• Vitamin A is crucial in cancer therapy, but can you get too much of this oil-soluble vitamin? High
doses of vitamin A (500,000 IU) can have acute reversible effects. Toxicity may start as low as 25,000
IU in those with impaired liver function (caused by drugs, hepatitis, or protein malnutrition) Otherwise,
it begins at several hundred thousand IU.
• Toxicity of vitamin A can be reduced by taking vitamin E at the same time. This mitigates lipid
peroxide effects.
• Toxicity of beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A, as found in greens and carrot juice) has never been found.
One 15-year study involved immense beta-carotene intake.
• Experiment after experiment has revealed that when vitamin A is missing, cancer can be started in
animals; but, when it is present in abundance, not even fast growing implanted cancers will not survive
in test animals. Vitamin A inhibits the induction and retards the growth of both malignant and non-
malignant tumors. Taken over a short period, vitamin A can greatly aid in recovery of cancer. Take large
doses (up to 150,000 units per day or you may wish to remain with smaller doses: 50,000 units, twice a
day). Later you can reduce this to a smaller amount.
• Take vitamin A in emulsified form to minimize liver involvement. Alternate, taking it 2 weeks on and
1 weeks off. Blurred vision and a soapy feeling in the mouth are signs that the body has too much A.
(Vitamin A and D, which are oil soluble, can be taken in excessive amounts, so one must always be
careful. Never take large amounts of either for too long a time.)
• In some instances, a person needs to take as much as 300,000 IU of vitamin A. When this must be
done, taking 3200 IU of vitamin E will help reduce the risk of vitamin A toxicity.
• Vitamin A derivatives (retinoids) reverse bronchial metaplasia.
• Vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene reduce the risk of cancer by radiation and chemical carcinogen
exposure. Vitamins A,D. and E inhibit oncogenes activity.
• Varying amounts of Vitamin A were given to different patients with bladder cancer. Those receiving
the smallest dosages were the most likely to have recurring cancer (i.e., the cancer return later).
• The B-complex vitamins help prevent cirrhosis of the liver. This is important because a damaged liver
has a 60% greater chance of becoming malignant. Dr. Max Gerson found that to be consistently true.
Take a B-complex supplement. Also take 3-4 tablespoons of brewer's yeast each day. Do not eat
baker's yeast; it contains live yeast and is not good for you.
• Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner and director of the Max Plank Institute in Berlin, declared that
there is a lack of one or more of three B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid) in tissue
which becomes cancerous.
• In various countries, nearly 200 scientists have reported on the importance of niacin (vitamin B3) in
preventing and treating cancer.
• 2 grams of Niacin (B3) daily is recommended as an anti-cancer factor.
• Niacin has been recommended by the NIH in amounts up to 3000-6000 mg, for lowering cholesterol.
But time release niacin is more suspect of causing liver damage; amounts which might do this were not
given.
• Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal with pyridoxal-5-pyrophosphate (P5P) is helpful in reducing
damage from radiation therapy and slowing cancer growth from polyamine synthesis of the tumor.
Especially good when a B6 ointment is applied to surface melanoma tumors. It helps prevent respiratory
and cervical cancer (Nutrition and Cancer, June 1984).
• B6-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor susceptibility and increased tumor size. In another
experiment, animals fortified with B6 and then injected with melanoma (skin) cancer cells, showed a
greater resistance to this deadly form of cancer. Studies on humans revealed similar results.
• Less than 500 mg of vitamin B-6 in humans appears to be safe.
• Vitamin B12 dramatically augments the tumor kill of vitamin C.
• A combination of folate (folic acid, a B vitamin) and B12 has been found to reverse bronchial
metaplasia (pre-malignant lesions). Folic acid protects against cervical cancer (American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition, January 1982).
• Pangamic acid is vitamin B15. Many scientists (Warburg, Goldblatt, etc.) believe that chronic
oxygen deficiency in cells leads to cancer cell formation. Pangamic acid increases the body's resistance
to oxygen deficiency. Remember that cancer cells do not use oxygen and that poorly oxygenated cells
are the most likely to become malignant.
• Laetrile (also called amygdalin, nitrilosides, or vitamin B17) is another substance used to eliminate
cancer. It is derived from apricot pits (seeds). Take two 500 mg tablets of laetrile 3 times a day. It is also
found in all fruit kernels, except those of citrus. Other food sources, which contain lesser amounts,
include lima beans, lentils, mung beans, crab apples, peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, cranberries,
sprouted seeds, and apples (chew up the seeds as well as the apple).
• Several apricot kernels (i.e., apricots seeds or pits) should be eaten at each protein meal. Six per day
may be sufficient. They should be eaten with food or, better yet, with fresh, frozen, or dried apricots.
The slightly bitter ones contain more laetrile (also called nitriloside or amygdalin), and are better for
you than are the sweet ones. Do not mix the sweet and bitter varieties; there may be an interaction. If
available, 100 mg of oral Amygdalin may be substituted.
• If people regularly ate the seeds when they eat apples, peaches, apricots, they would get enough
laetrile. Starting to do this earlier, will help prevent cancer from forming later on.
• But when cancer is already developing, 500-590 mg of Amygdalin, in solid tablet form, should be
swallowed at the two larger meals. They should not be taken on an empty stomach.
• Vitamin C is a powerful aid in resisting cancer and other diseases. Swedish studies, at Karolinska and
Umea Hospitals, revealed that vitamin C in large doses can be an effective agent in fighting cancer.
• Vitamin C blocks the carcinogenic effects of most poisons, including nitrates. Vitamin C can be taken
to bowel tolerance. This means you can take as much as you can, until you begin to have diarrhea. When
the body tissues reach saturation on C, the remainder of this water-soluble vitamin is sent into the bowel,
which reacts to the acidity by somewhat runny bowels till the C is gone. Take large doses of 5,000 mg or
more a day. It is the most powerful antitoxin known, and can neutralize or minimize the damaging effect
of most chemical carcinogens entering your body from the air, water, or food.
• Cancer of the bladder can occur when the amino acid tryptophan is not properly metabolized, resulting
in oxidation of its metabolites. Vitamin C prevents that oxidation process, and thus blocks cancer
development. It is a preventative agent against a variety of cancers (Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, 73, 1984).
• Vitamin C is such a potent cancer fighter, that it is well to here provide additional information:
Deficiency symptoms include slow wound healing, pain in joints, immune suppression, bleeding gums,
irritability, and increased risk of cancer. If you take too much at a time, it will cause mild diarrhea within
30 minutes. Intake: RDA: 60 mg. Usual U.S.: 114 mg. Prophylactic: 500-2000 mg. Therapeutic: 500-
100,000 mg.
• Taken in larger doses, Vitamins A and C inhibit hyaluronidase, an enzyme found in cancerous
tissues.
• Vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants. When accompanied by the minerals, selenium and zinc, they
help protect against malignancies.
• Low serum levels of vitamin A and E were common in patients receiving, and responding poorly to,
chemotherapy. The great danger in using chemotherapy and radiation is the damage, introduction of a
poisonous conditions, and destruction of anti-cancer vitamins.
• Vitamin C and beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A) have been found to be effective in reversing cervical
dysplasia and oral leukoplakia in humans.
• Vitamins C and K separately showed anti-tumor activity against human cancer cells in vitro, but
became synergistically effective at 2% the regular dosage when used together.
• A substance in vitamin D, known as 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol has been discovered to be an anti-
cancer factor. But, due to toxicity of vitamin D overdose, must be used only under the care of a
professional. For most of us, it is best to avoid using too much vitamin D, although some is needed.
Sunshine is the best source. (Fish oils can cause heart trouble.)
• Vitamin E, working with C, inhibits the activity of a growth substance (catalyst) found in cancerous
tissue. Take up to 1,000 units a day. Vitamins C and E help the body inhibit the activity of the enzyme
hyaluronidase, found in cancerous tissue.
• A lack of beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamin E, and B complex in lung tissue may be related to
lung cancer.
• Injections of vitamin E, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin (a carotenoid) and algae extract
dramatically bolstered levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, and reversed hamster buccal pouch tumors.
• Human prostatic cancer cells in vitro were markedly reduced when vitamin E was added. It helps
protect against bowel cancer (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 73, 1984).
• Vitamin F is the essential fatty acids. Add 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed vegetable oil to each food
meal (not juice-only meals). Wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil are the best. Corn oil and soy oil are
second best. Safflower oil is not so good. Make sure the oil is fresh and kept refrigerated when not in
use. Never use cottonseed oil (it can cause blindness), hydrogenated oils, lard, greases, or animal
products. The oil in the nuts is good, if the nuts are fresh.
• Vitamin K helps protect the body against certain cancer-causing substances. Take it with vitamin C to
increase its cancer-reducing strength.
• Quercetin (one of the bioflavonoids which, together, are called vitamin P) increased the cell kill rate
in cancer cells, which were exposed to hyperthermia (heat therapy) with no negative effect on normal
healthy cells.
• Quercetin reduced cancers in animals exposed to two carcinogens."
disease-general-minerals,Minerals,"• A Cancer Control Convention, meeting in Japan, reported that the trace mineral, germanium, in the
diet is a significant factor in preventing and eliminating cancer.
• One cancer researcher, who studied in-depth into cancer remedies over the past 150 years, declared
that every effective anticancer formula (Glyoxylide, which is the Koch treatment; the Hoxsey herbs;
Hypotonic therapy; laetrile; the Gerson method; Krebiozen; and Carcalon) involves extra amounts of
potassium. This is very important.
• Be sure to include a significantly higher intake of potassium. Potassium deficiency is considered by
Gerson, Scott, and others as a primary contributing cause of cancer.
• Potassium foods include almonds, apples, dried apricots, bananas, beans, beets, broccoli, carrots,
dulse, grapes, kale, olives, pecans, rice bran, sunflower seeds, wheat bran, and germ. These foods help
the body resist and overcome tumors, cysts, and malignancies.
• Center your diet around potassium foods. Here are more of them:
• Dried apricots, asparagus, pearled barley, dried navy beans, fresh lima beans, raw beets, sprouted bread
with no salt, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, caraway seed, cauliflower, celery seed, small leaves
of chard, dark raw cherries, dandelion greens, dill seed, endive, unsulphured figs (dried or raw), garlic,
concord or emperor grapes, grapefruit, fresh horseradish, fresh lemons, lentils, fresh limes, nectarines,
okra, onions, oranges, fresh parsley, dried or raw peaches, Bartlett pears, dry or fresh peas, persimmons,
raw pineapple (never canned), raw plums, dried or raw prunes, raw quinces, raisins, wild or brown rice,
sage, rolled oats, spinach, squash (acorn, Hubbard, yellow summer), tangerines, raw tapioca, raw turnip
leaves, and watermelon.
• Drink potassium broths daily. Prepare them from half-inch thick potato peelings, which are then
cooked. Draw off the water and drink it.
• You want foods which are high in iodine and potassium, low in sodium, protein, and fat.
• Potassium ascorbate (12-20 g) can be taken as a partial potassium supplement. This product includes
vitamin C.
• Potassium and magnesium are among the more crucial minerals for cancer recovery. Magnesium
helps to stabilize cell membranes and elevate immune activity while potassium plays a critical role in
membrane permeability. (Magnesium, 400-800 mg daily from aspartate, citrate, or orotate.)
• Magnesium protects against cancer in general (Medical Hypotheses, August 1980).
• Calcium and magnesium have a beneficial effect in helping the body resist colon cancer. Natural
iron supplements help prevent thyroid cancer. (But many iron supplements are dangerous! Take
blackstrap molasses instead of iron pills.)
• The New England Journal of Medicine reported that calcium may prevent precancerous cells from
becoming cancerous. Calcium protects against colon cancer (American Journal of Epidemiology,
September 1988).
• Calcium supplements (2000 mg) provide a marked suppression of rectal cancer proliferation. It
inhibits early stages of colon cancer in genetically vulnerable individuals.
• Iodine and trace minerals are crucial. You can obtain them by each day eating some Nova Scotia
dulse or Norwegian kelp. Both are special seaweeds which have a wide spectrum of trace minerals. Food
grown on the continents does not have all those trace minerals; rainwater has gradually depleted the
soils.
• Iodine protects against breast cancer (Lancet, April 1976).
• It is very important to keep the iodine level of the blood normal, so both the thyroid and body tissues
will have proper cell oxidation. Eat a sufficient amount of dulse, or kelp, each day. (Do not use
California kelp.)
• People with myxedema, or underactive thyroids, are more prone to developing cancer. So keep your
thyroid in good condition with seaweed.
• Japan and Iceland both have low goiter and breast cancer rates. This may be because their diets are rich
in iodine and selenium. Breast cancer has been linked to an iodine deficiency. Japanese women have
almost no breast cancer. Colon cancer rates in Japan are also low.
• Studies at the University of Zurich and in London Polytechnic revealed that brewer's or food yeast
gives improved resistance against cancer development. Brewer's yeast is one of the best sources of
selenium, an important anticancer mineral.
• Selenium made the headlines, at the end of 1996, as a special trace mineral which could dramatically
reduce cancer in the human body. It completely inhibited tumor growth in mice inoculated with tumor
cells.
• Selenium helps eliminate cancer in five ways: It improves detoxification, bolsters immune function,
directly toxic to tumor cells, and may is a valuable anti-proliferative factor (Lancet, July 1983).
Selenium intake should not exceed 2500 mcg (2.5 mg) per day.
• Using selenium as a sole therapy, there was a 38.8% favorable response rate in patients with oral
cancer.
• High doses of selenium (equivalent to 54 mg in humans) resulted in 83-90% reduction in rate of tumor
growth in mice.
• Long-term usage of 5000 mcg of selenium may result in fingernail changes and hair loss. Selenite is
more toxic than selenium bound to amino acids (i.e., selenomethionine). Ingestion of 1-5 mg/kg body
weight of selenite will produce toxic side effects. This is equivalent to 65,000 mcg in a 65 kg adult.
• Chromium as picolinate is very helpful in working with carcinoma. (400-800 mcg.)
• Zinc as zinc picolinate (30-100 mg) is also a significant help. It protects against prostrate cancer
(British Journal of Urology, October 1983).
• Cesium is neither essential nor toxic in cancer reduction. But it slightly alters the pH of cancer cells,
rendering them more vulnerable to immune attack."
disease-general-other-nutrients,Other Nutrients,"• Chlorophyll is an anticancer agent which slows the growth of cancerous tumors. It creates an
environment unfavorable to bacterial growth.
• A diet rich in chlorophyll is therapeutically effective for both external and internal infections, including
malignancies.
• Blue-green algae and chlorophyll clean and protect the blood
• CoQ10 (co-enzyme Q10) and germanium provide oxygen to the cells. So does vitamin E, working
in the liver. (Cancer does not use oxygen in the cells.)
• CoQ10 increases aerobic (oxygen) metabolism and immune function. Cancer cells thrive where there
is a lack of oxygen.
• CoQ10 sometimes reduces hair loss in those who choose to take chemotherapy.
• Scientists, at UCLA, have found that sodium linoleate, which contains linoleic acid (an essential
fatty acid) has the ability to fight cancer cells. Lecithin is a good source.
• Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) can be taken as oil of borage, evening primrose, or black current seed.
In purified form, up to 1.5 grams per day can be taken.
• Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil (1-2 tsp. daily). Make sure that it was stored in the
refrigerator at the health food store you purchase it from. Flaxseed oil becomes rancid very quickly, so
purchase small bottles."
disease-general-amino-acids,Amino Acids,"• Glutathione (200 grams), functions in the body as an antioxidant and helps destroy free radicals and
the toxicity remaining if you already have received radiation treatments and chemotherapy. Cruciferous
vegetables (broccoli, especially) increases the body's own production of glutathione peroxidase (GSH).
• Cysteine (N-acetylcysteine) (1-2 grams) is an amino acid which enters into various detoxification
systems in the body, helps bolster glutathione peroxidase activity, and can be converted in the body to
glutathione, which may become GSH, a potent broad spectrum anti-oxidant enzyme system. Cysteine
supplementation promote glutathione synthesis.
• Although safe up to 10 g, the nauseating taste and smell of cysteine can cause vomiting.
• Several studies confirm that arginine reduces tumors and tumor formation. It increases T-cell function,
stimulates the thymus and thyroid, and enhances activity of killer cells, as well as interleukin-2 receptors
and general immune improvements.
• At therapeutic levels (above 5 g) of arginine, growth of certain viruses may be activated.
• Methionine reduces the uptake of mercury, which is a cancer-causing agent.
• Malnourished cancer patients improve when branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and
valine) are given. Protein and albumin synthesis are heightened."
disease-general-preventing-cancer,Preventing Cancer,"The information in this section is primarily for medical researchers, but it is also invaluable for those
who want to prevent cancer from gaining a foothold in their bodies.
Because of modern nutritional, environmental, and living conditions, cancer rates are rapidly increasing.
In this chapter, the thoughtful reader will have learned a number of things which can help prevent the
occurrence of cancer.
• You have been a toxic waste site! And now, before the cancer has a chance to start, you are beginning
waste disposal operations. With prayer, diligent work, and the blessing of God, you can have success.
• While some are concerned with treating symptoms, you must be concerned with getting at the causes
of cancer and eliminating them. Only then can the problem be permanently solved.
The Gerson Therapy seems to do the best job of eliminating the toxins. You will find it discussed later in
this book.
• Well, there you have a number of possible suggestions. What you have just read may seem like a lot of
work. But, since cancer will generally mean the end of you, are you sure you do not want to work?
• It is extremely important that you care for and rebuild the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, bowels, and other
organs. Dr. Max Gerson maintained that he could eliminate cancer in anyone if the liver was in good
condition. Take care of your liver.
• If you have cancer, we recommend that you locate a physician and place yourself under his care. A
careful, systematic regime of healthful recovery is needed, and you may not know what to do.
Regardless of which doctor you go to, while waiting for appointments get started doing the right things!
Doctors may be busy, but your life depends on changes which need to start right now. Essentially
everything, listed here in Part One of this book, you can do at home to improve health and help prevent
malignancies.
• Do not fear. Trust your life to God; obey the Ten Commandments by faith in Christ; and step forward,
living your best and doing your best. Entrust the outcome to God.
• America alone spends $800 billion yearly on physicians and hospitals; yet it is 23rd in the world in
level of health, vitality, and longevity. Surely, it is time that we start thinking for ourselves.
• All information in this section, and throughout this book, is offered purely for educational,
research, and experimental purposes—as an objective report, not as a recommendation or

disease-head-sinusitis,Sinusitis,"TREATMENT
• Do not suppress a cold, flu, sore throat, infected tonsils, or other acute disease. Go to
bed, take juices and light meals, rest, and get well. When suppressed, the phlegm does not
flow out, but hardens in the sinuses and trouble begins.
• Take a short fast on citrus juices, vegetable juices, and herb teas. Drink lots of water and
juices.
• As soon as you are able, begin eating nourishing food, especially vegetables, fruits, nuts,
and beans. Drink fresh carrot juice every day.
• Eliminate meat, dairy products, white flour foods, and sugar.
• Do not use nose drops; they aggravate the situation by stopping the drainage and
hardening the mucous. Decongestants also increase blood pressure.
• Hot liquids help the sinuses flow out their contents.
• Helpful herbs to reduce sinus congestion would include comfrey, slippery elm,
fenugreek, mullein, aloe vera, yerba santa, red clover, and white oak bark.
• Garlic contains a chemical which makes mucous less sticky. Horseradish has it also.
Cayenne acts in a somewhat similar manner. Peppermint tea also helps open up the sinus
passageways.
• Add crushed garlic cloves to 4 cups water; remove from the heat after coming to a boil.
Cool and gradually drink. This will help clean out the sinuses and lower stuffiness.
• Heat on the sinuses helps relieve pain. This can be hot wet compresses, a heat lamp, a 60-
watt light bulb, or a heating pad.
• A variation of this is: Twice a day, lean over a pan of hot water with a towel draped over
your head (or stand in a hot shower). Inhale the vapors as they waft up toward your nose.
If you are at work, order a cup of something hot; and, leaning over, sniff up the moisture.
• Some prefer cold applications to the sinuses, instead of hot ones. Put crushed ice in a
plastic sack, wrap in a moist towel, and place over the sinus which hurts. At the same
time, have the feet in hot water. This will help draw blood from the sinus area. However,
the hot method is better for draining the sinuses.
• Mix 1 tsp. of salt with 2 cups warm water. Pour it into a small glass; and, holding back
your head, sniff it up into one nostril (as you pinch the other one closed). Repeat for the
other side.
• Rubbing your sore sinuses brings a fresh supply of blood to the area. Press your thumbs
firmly on either side of your nose and hold for 15-30 seconds.
• Sit with your head between your knees. Cough gently as though you were clearing your
throat. Then hold your breath for a minute or so, as the mucous slowly drains. Then gently
inhale. Be sure you are drinking enough fluids when you do this.
• Walking helps clear your sinuses.
• Between meals every day, take six charcoal tablets with water. This will help remove
toxins. Only do this during the crisis, or it can cause temporary constipation.
• It is better to sniffle than to blow your nose. If you must blow, only blow lightly and
through one nostril at a time.
• A humidifier will help keep sinuses moist indoors during the winter months. A humidity
of 40-50% will increase sinus comfort.
• Avoid cold, damp living, working, and sleeping quarters.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Ask God to do for you those things which you cannot do for yourself. Tell
Jesus everything. Lay open before Him the secrets of your heart, for His eye reads it all. Surrender your
life to Him, and let Him enable you to obey His Ten Commandment law.
Section 4
Head and Throat
Part 2
Hair
BALDNESS and HAIR LOSS
(Alopecia)
SYMPTOMS—It is hair on the head that we are concerned with here. There are several types of hair
loss: baldness or loss of hair (alopecia). Loss of all scalp hair (alopecia totalis). Hair falling out in
patches (alopecia areata). Another type of hair loss is localized and is due to scarring. Alopecia most
frequently occurs in men, but occasionally in women. Most common of all is the standard male pattern
of baldness and the female pattern of baldness.
A single hair generally lasts 2-6 years, and is then replaced by a new hair. When baldness begins, there
is an excess of shorter, thinner hair—the kind babies have on their head.
Remember that it is normal to lose as much as 100 hairs a day. Once the hair follicle dies, it never again
produces hair. But there are instances in which the follicle has not died, but only has stopped producing
hair. Careful treatment restores hair growth.
CAUSES—Heredity (especially in men), hormonal factors, aging, or local or systemic disease.
Localized hair loss could also be caused by scarring following a wound or an operation.
Other factors include poor circulation, high fever or other acute illness, surgery, radiation (X-ray
therapy), medicinal drugs, anesthesia, drastic reducing diets, stress (depletes B vitamins), poor diet, skin
disease, sudden weight loss, iron deficiency, thyroid disease, obesity, birth control pills, diabetes, or
vitamin deficiency. A nourishing diet should be eaten daily.
A significant cause of baldness is the use of hair dyes. Another is using hot air dryers.
Hair loss in women most often occurs after menopause. Some women lose some hair 2-3 months after
childbirth because hormonal changes, during late term, tended to block normal hair loss; this is reversed
within 6 months.
Hypothyroidism can cause hair loss. Too little vitamin A can cause hair loss, and too much can do it
also.
• The circulation in the scalp (which is poorer in men than in women) needs to be
improved. Massaging the scalp daily helps. Keep the scalp and hair clean; however, do not
wash the hair too frequently. Avoid excess shampooing.
• There should be adequate protein in the diet (especially vegetable seeds, such as sesame,
pumpkin, sunflower, almonds), brewer's yeast and fresh brewer's yeast; but, as with
everything, do not go overboard. (People in the U.S. eat more protein than anyone else,
yet they have the greatest hair loss.)
• A variety of factors affect hair loss. Minerals and vitamins are also important for hair
growth. Take a good supplement at least twice a day. Drink fresh vegetable juice at least
once a day. Take vitamin A (50,000 units daily). Several B vitamins especially affect hair
growth and color. Eat sea kelp or dulse. biotin, inositol, niacin, vitamin E, and PABA are
also important.
• Oatstraw and horsetail tea are rich in silicon and trace minerals. Rosemary helps prevent
premature baldness and stimulate head circulation. Sage is an astringent, and helps
stimulate growth. Yarrow helps liver activity.
• Avoid salt, sugar, tobacco, and alcohol. Overconsumption of salt and sugar increases
dandruff and hair loss. Avoid large amounts of vitamin A (100,000 units daily over long
periods).
• Beware of the drug, minoxidil. Although given to restore scalp hair, it is high-priced and
may cause heart damage. The hair it produces is of a poor quality, and tends to fall out
when the drug is terminated.
• Some people put a little cayenne pepper on their scalp. It surely will bring the blood, and
might even produce some hair! But it may get in the eyes! Most people are not prepared to
deal with this extreme method.
• There are others who stand on their head to bring the blood there! It is reported that this
also helps. Do not do it at work, or folks will think you are crazy. (And, of course, too
much of this would not be good for the brain.) Others lie on slant boards for a time each
day.
Here are more suggestions:
• Try rubbing the juice of a quince on the bald area every day. Eat flaxseed and drink sage
tea. Iodine (in Norwegian kelp or Nova Scotia dulse) in your diet may help. Rub bald
spots with kerosene once a day. For falling hair, try wetting the scalp daily with strong
rosemary, sage or white oak bark tea.
• But, first and foremost, you need to go on a cleansing juice program for a couple days,
and clean the bowels. Then only eat nourishing food, and no more processed junk.
• It is said that you must faithfully do your selected hair treatment for two months before
you will see results.
• Never use strong soaps or hair sprays. Only use mild castile soaps.
• Hats and wigs are apt to cause hair to fall out faster, since they limit the air to the scalp.
• One natural remedies expert gives this advice: ""Eat all raw food, massage your scalp
often in the sun, wiggle your ears a lot, and stand on your head or lie on a slant board.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Happiness from earthly sources is constantly changeable. But Christ can give
you peace and rest which is beyond compare. Let Him, by faith, dwell in your heart.

(Sinus Trouble)
SYMPTOMS—One or more of the following symptoms: facial pain, tenderness on the cheekbones,
face and forehead, earache, headache, dry cough, bad breath, fever, dazed feeling in the head, loss of
smell, and burning and tearing eyes. Sometimes it results in a swollen face, stuffy nose, and a thick
mucous discharge.
CAUSES—The nasal sinuses are located in the bones surrounding the eyes and nose. They help your
voice sound fuller and richer. They also help store overflow phlegm in time of illness.
Sinusitis is an inflammation of the nasal sinuses that generally occurs together with upper respiratory
infection. Colds or bacterial and viral infections spread into the sinuses.
Sinus problems which have become chronic may be caused by injury of the nasal bones, smoking, small
growths in the nose, or irritant fumes and odors.
Allergenic sinusitis may result from plant pollens (hay fever) or allergies to milk; dairy products; or, less
likely, wheat.
An over-acid condition in the stomach can cause sinus troubles. Poor digestion of starch, sugar, and
dairy products can produce a runny nose. When force is used in blowing the nose, phlegm is pushed up
into the sinuses.
Swimming or diving can force phlegm up into the sinuses.
Allergic rhinitis is a common cause of sinusitis. Avoid substances which might be giving you allergies.
Decayed teeth, enlarged and infected adenoids, cigarette smoke, perfume, household cleansers, and
dusty air can cause irritation to the sinuses.
So sinus trouble can either be caused by an infection or by other things. If drainage is clear after a week,
you probably have no infection; but, if mucous is greenish or yellowish, you do. If drainage is clear and
there are no accompanying symptoms of a common cold, you probably have an allergy.
Few people with sinus trouble have actual sinus infection (sinusitis).
Beware of swelling around the eyes! If left untreated, this can lead to bronchitis, asthma, throat
infection, or pneumonia.
If you are interested in figuring out which sinuses may be bothering you, here is some helpful data:
Frontal sinuses produce frontal headaches which are most severe between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Maxillary sinuses makes pain in the upper teeth and cheek, and sometimes eye pain as well. It generally
lasts from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Ethmoid sinuses induce a dull pain behind the eyes, pain in eye movements, tearing, light sensitivity,
and occasionally sore throat and nighttime cough."
disease-head-eye-problems,Eye Problems,"TREATMENT
• Certain eye problems need specialized attention. But there are also general solutions to a
wide variety of eye problems. The eyes and the brain use a lot of oxygen; be sure and get
enough.
• Poor nutrition clogs tiny arteries, such as are found in the eyes. A gradual clogging of the
veins in the eyes can lead to blindness.
• Eliminate all fried foods. The free radicals in these greasy foods damages the organs.
• Drink carrot, celery, beet, and parsley juice. You may need to go on a short vegetable
juice fast.
• The mineral, zinc, is important. Be sure it is included in your diet.
• Avoid drinking fluids before bed. Avoid salt. Do not smoke, and avoid second-hand
smoke.
• Eyebright, golden seal, and red raspberry teas all help the eyes. Eyebright is especially
noted for what it can do for the eyes; people have used it for centuries.
• Dandelion helps the liver detoxify, and seaweed (Norway kelp or Nova Scotia dulse)
provides essential minerals.
• Vitamins A, B complex, C, E, selenium, and zinc are also important. Be sure and eat
greens every day.
• Nicotine, sugar, and caffeine all weaken the eyes.
• Tinted sunglasses often cause eyestrain. Only use polarized sunglasses, if you use them
at all.
• Margarine and vegetable shortening are not good for the eyes.
• To strengthen the eyes, especially in weakness resulting from diabetes, use chaparral tea
internally. Vitamin A is also important.
• Place a washcloth, dipped in ice water, over your eyes for 15 minutes, once or twice a
day. Or cold cucumber slices can be put on your eyes.
• A number of medicinal drugs are not good for the eyes. This would include aspirin,
ACTH, anticoagulants, corticosteroids, diuretics, streptomycin, sulfa drugs, tetracycline,
allopurinol, antihistamines, digitalis, haloperidol, anti-infection drugs, quinine, marijuana,
and some others.
• Anti-infection drugs, including diazepam (Valium), haloperidol (Haldol), some
antidepressants, quinine, and sulfa drugs can cause ocular abnormalities.
• Contact lenses: Be very cautious about wearing contact lenses! They keep air from the
eyeball surfaces which they cover. Infections can result. Leaving them in place more than
24 hours can produce ulcerative keratitis. The cells of the cornea are rubbed away by the
contact lens, resulting in infection and scarring, and possible eventual blindness. Research
shows that this danger applies equally to ordinary daily wear contact lenses or extended-
wear lenses.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Make God your entire dependence. When you find yourself starting to do
otherwise, immediately call a halt—and run back to Him! Do not tarry; do not wait.

SYMPTOMS—Various kinds of eye problems can develop, such as blurred vision, bulging, blood
spots, dark circles, dryness, double vision, itching, lumps on the eyelids, redness, twitching, or watering."
disease-head-eye-inflammation,Eye Inflammation,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
EXTERNAL INFLAMMATlONS—Light weight Fomentations for 15 minutes, every 2 hours;
frequently renewed cooling compress during intervals between.
INFLAMMATIONS OF EYEBALL—A Fomentation covering the eye (while the eye is closed) and
extending to the forehead, for 15-20 minutes or until the skin is well-reddened. Repeat as often as
necessary, to relieve pain. Employ the frequently renewed (5-15 minutes at 600 F.) Heating Compress
during the intervals between hot applications."
disease-head-eyestrain,Eyestrain,"SYMPTOMS—The eyes seem to be straining to see what they are trying to look at. After some time of
doing this, you acquire a general feeling of eyestrain.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• Is the area in which you do much of your eyework properly lit?
• Flickering tubes can bother the eyes. Try not to use computers too long at a time; do not
watch television too long. Both are hard on your eyes. Keep the screen somewhat
darkened. Shade your screen by placing a hood over the front.
• Every so often, shut and rest your eyes. Try ""palming."" To do this, place the palms
across your open eyes, without touching them. This cuts out all light and enables you to
momentarily rest them from all light.
• Make sure you blink often enough. Each blink cleanses and refreshes them.
• Refuse to strain your eyes. Keep them relaxed at all time.
• Sunglasses cause eyestrain for some people; they help others. Only use Polaroid glasses.
• The evening hours are the worst time to read and use your eyes intensively for anything.
The natural daylight is gone.
• Go outside for the last 30 minutes before bedtime, walk around, relax, breathe deep, and
do not read anymore before you retire.
• Get enough rest at night.
• You may need reading glasses. If your only eye problem is nearsightedness, you can
purchase eye glasses at your local pharmacy for $10 or $20. Always select the weakest,
least powerful ones.
ENCOURAGEMENT—By beholding Christ, we become changed. And this is what you want, is it
not? Come, take the greatest prize of all; let Christ come into your heart. He can give overcoming
strength to resist sin and obey the Ten Commandments."
disease-head-nearsightedness,Nearsightedness,"(Myopia)
SYMPTOMS—A person only clearly sees those things which are close up.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—There is both an occupational and nutritional cause for this.
• Constantly using the eyes, to see that which is fairly close, causes them to adjust better to
near vision. Every so often, rest your eyes by looking at something at a distance.
• A lack of vitamin D and calcium is also involved. Increase the amount of vitamin D
taken, and take sunbaths.
• Do not strain the eyes, thinking that will help you improve your eyesight! Doing so only
weakens the delicate muscles, and will result in still more vision problems.
— Also read ""Eyestrain.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Cry to God for help. Find in Him your all in all. He can deliver; He can help.
He can satisfy your deepest soul desire."
disease-head-yellow-eyes,Yellow Eyes,"TREATMENT
• Treatment of jaundice includes ultraviolet light exposure in order to increase elimination
and liver flush. For 3 days, drink apple juice, followed by a cup of olive oil and a cup of
lemon juice. Also obtain vitamins C, A, and E.
—Also see Jaundice
ENCOURAGEMENT—Keep your mind on Jesus, and pride and the love of the world will vanish.
Beside the loveliness of Christ, all earthly attractions will seem of little worth.

(Icterus; Jaundice)
SYMPTOMS—The whites of the eyes (sclera) have a yellow cast.
CAUSES—The bile duct system develops a blockage, which produces gallstones, possibly tumors, and
hepatitis. Red blood cells may also be destroyed in the process.
Those taking large amounts of carrot juice will develop a yellowish cast to their skin (which is in no way
dangerous). But their sclera will not turn yellow, which is the sign of jaundice."
disease-head-red-eyes,Red Eyes,"TREATMENT
• Get more rest at night. Pause and rest a little more during the day.
• Do not use ""drops"" from the pharmacy. They have an agent in them that constricts the
blood vessels. This may make your whites look whiter for awhile, but no problems have
been solved. Do not tinker with your precious eyes! When the drops wear off in a couple
hours, the redness generally appears redder than before.
• Lay a cool, wet washcloth over your closed eye. The cold constricts the blood vessels
naturally, and the moisture helps your eyes.
• Be sure and drink enough water, so you will have an adequate amount of fluid in your
tear ducts.
• If the eyes are red when you wake up, the problem may be your eyelids. This is a low-
grade infection of the eyelids. Treat it by washing your eyes with warm water at night
before retiring.
• Any problem in the eyes should be taken seriously. Infection can be treated with a small
amount of boric acid mixed with sterile water.
• Helpful herbs include eyebright, fennel, and cornflower. Eyebright is remarkably helpful
for a number of eye conditions.
ENCOURAGEMENT—There must be a constant, earnest struggling of the soul against the evil
imaginings of the mind. There must be a steadfast resistance of temptation to sin in thought or act. But,
in the strength of Christ, this can be done. In Him we can live clean, pure lives.

SYMPTOMS—Red lines in the whites of the eyes.
CAUSES—This can be caused by dust, pollen allergies, bright sunshine, cigarette smoke, other irritants,
overwork, and staying up late at night.
People over 40 commonly experience this problem to some extent. But if it is excessive, or if you are
younger, you may wish to give it closer attention."
disease-head-itchy-eyes,Itchy Eyes,"TREATMENT
• Do not overwork or overeat. Eat a nutritious diet. Get enough rest at night.
• The diet should include the entire B complex, with an emphasis on B . Be sure your diet
6
includes adequate calcium.
• Do not strain the eyes.
• Eyebright is a good herb for the eyes, which may help this.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The very first step in the path to life is to keep the mind stayed on God, to
have His fear continually before the eyes. If you cannot take Jesus with you, do not go there. Do not
watch it. Do not listen to it.

SYMPTOMS—The eyes seem tired and itchy.
CAUSES—Enervation, poor diet, lack of rest."
disease-head-dry-tear-ducts,Dry Tear Ducts,"TREATMENT
• Be sure and obtain adequate amounts of vitamin A (50,000 units daily). A lack of it
causes small openings to close down. Also include enough essential fatty acids in your
diet, along with more calcium.
• Do not eat junk or processed foods.
—Also see ""Sjogren's Disease""; you may have it.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Those who love God are changed from being rebels against the law of God
into obedient servants and subjects of His kingdom. They live to help and bless others.

SYMPTOMS—The eyes seem dry all the time.
CAUSES—There is a small tear duct which keeps each eye moist, yet it does not seem to be working
properly."
disease-head-black-eye,Black Eye,"TREATMENT
• Boxing trainers deal with black eyes all the time. They apply an extremely cold piece of
iron (something like a small tire iron) to the area. This reduces the swelling. An alternative
is to hold a clean, cold soda can against the cheek (but not against the eye itself) for
several minutes. Do not place any pressure on the eye itself.
• Do not take aspirin. Because it is an anticoagulant, the blood will not clot as well.
Instead, the bleeding will continue longer.
• Do not blow your nose! If you received a severe strike, blowing your nose could cause
blood vessels to burst beneath the skin in a much wider area! Sometimes the injury
fractures the eye socket bone, and blowing your nose could force air out of your sinus
adjacent to the socket. The air is injected under the skin—making the eyelids swell even
more. This can increase the likelihood of infection.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence, and gains us the victory. And this is
what we need! We must have God or perish. We must submit to Him and obey Him. By the grace of
Christ, this can be done.

SYMPTOMS—The area around the eye turns black, following a blow to it.
CAUSES—Blood tends to pool around the delicate eyeball, in order to hasten healing."
disease-head-ulcerated-eye-and-lid,Ulcerated Eye And Lid,"TREATMENT
• Obtain adequate rest, improve the diet, and take large doses of vitamin C (2,000 mg, 3
times a day).
• Apply warm yellow dock tea, in a poultice, to the eyelid. You can also drink it.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Every day learn something new from the Scriptures. Search them as for hid
treasures, for they contain the words of eternal life.

SYMPTOMS—The eye has become inflamed, resulting in an ulcer on the eyeball.
The problem could then extend to the eyelid.
CAUSES—This happened because the normal covering of the eye was damaged in some way. The
infection is generally caused by a virus."
disease-head-mucous-in-eye,Mucous In Eye,"TREATMENT
• Improve the diet, and take a vitamin/mineral supplement twice a day. Obtain adequate
rest. Work in a clear environment that is not overly dusty.
• Wash each eye with goldenseal root tea. But do not use goldenseal in large amounts if
pregnant.
ENCOURAGEMENT—He who receives Christ by living faith has a living connection with God. He
carries with him the atmosphere of heaven, which is the grace of God and a treasure that the world
cannot buy.

SYMPTOMS—The eye seems be filled with mucous.
CAUSES—The cause may be a combination of an inadequate diet, poor working conditions, and an
airborne infection."
disease-head-nosebleed,Nosebleed,"TREATMENT
Anterior nosebleeds (from the nose itself) are most common:
• Blow out the clots, then sit in a chair and lean forward without tilting the head back. (If
you lie down or lean backward, you will swallow blood.) Put a small piece of wet cotton
(or cloth) in the nose and pinch lightly on it for 5 minutes. Then apply cold washcloths or
an ice pack to the nose, cheek, and neck. (Another suggestion is to have him lightly sniff
cold water with a little salt or lemon juice added.)
• Then apply vitamin E oil (or petroleum jelly) to the inside of the nose. Lie back and rest
for a time. If the nosebleeds are serious enough to warrant it, rest as much as you can for
two days.
• The rupture in the blood vessel that caused the nosebleed requires 7-10 days to
completely heal. When the bleeding stops, a clot forms and then becomes a scab. Do not
pick it loose.
• Make sure you are getting enough vitamin K in the diet. It is found in all dark greens.
Put lactobacillus acidophilus in the colon. It will synthesize, and thus increase, the amount
of vitamin K in your body.
• Be sure to take enough vitamin C. Calcium, magnesium, alfalfa, and vitamin E are also
important.
• When the nose dries out excessively, nosebleed can occur. Try increasing the humidity
in the room. Consider purchasing a humidifier. Smoking dries out the nasal membranes.
• Medicinal blood thinners can cause nosebleeds. Blood thinner drugs are what you find in
D-Con rat poison.
• White oak bark (or bayberry or ephedra sinica) tea is an astringent. It can be snuffed up
the nose before inserting the cotton.
• A little cayenne can be swallowed in some water. This will draw blood away from the
head to the stomach.
The other type is the posterior nosebleed:
• This occurs in the elderly, and is caused by high blood pressure. The bleeding starts in
the rear of the nose, and runs down into the throat. The blood pressure must be lowered!
Increase water intake and see a physician.
• Keep in mind that a posterior nosebleed is far better than having a blood vessel rupture
from high blood pressure—inside the cranial cavity. Then you have a stroke!
Whichever type of nosebleed may occur, here are additional suggestions:
• Those with frequent nosebleeds should take extra iron. It is needed to make hemoglobin.
Rutin is also needed.
• Avoid oral contraceptives. Anything that changes estrogen levels can make you more
prone to nosebleeds.
HYDRO—Here are several treatments for nosebleed, discussed in the author's book, Water Therapy
Manual ( see order sheet):
• Contrast Bath to the Hand or Arm. Two very deep pails may be used. The hot water
should be as hot as can be borne (p. 114).
• Hot Foot Bath. This can also be used to stop a nosebleed (p. 116).
• Cold Plantar Douche. This is a cold water spray to the bottom of the feet (p. 166).
• Ice Bag to back of the neck; short hot Fomentations to the face (p. 218).
• Ice to the back of the neck; Hot Compress over face; ice to hands; elevate hands to
vertical position, if necessary; Hot Foot Bath or Hot Leg Pack; very Hot Nasal Douche (p.
224).
ENCOURAGEMENT—If we are in Christ, we are heaven-bound. So we must not seem mournful to
those around us. Rejoice, for every day is one day nearer heaven! Do all you can to be a blessing to
those you come in contact with.

(Epistaxis)
SYMPTOMS—The nose bleeds.
CAUSES—Physical injury, excessive dryness causing the nasal surface to crack, scratching with the
fingernail, blowing the nose hard, sudden change in atmospheric pressure."
disease-head-ear-congestion,Ear Congestion,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
NOTE—This section deals with methods of reducing blood congestion in the middle ear and inner ear,
and was taken, with slight adaptation, from Dr. William L. McKie's book, Scientific Hydrotherapy, page
55.
DRAINING THE MIDDLE EAR—Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and
face, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the Hot Compress
extends below the jaw, the common carotid will be dilated (enlarged), which you do not want. An Ice
Bag should be placed below the jaw at the same time. This will increase the effect, by contracting the
carotid.
DRAINING THE INNER EAR—The internal ear, receiving its blood supply from the vertebral artery,
a branch of the subclavian, is not affected by heat over the ear. But the inner ear problem may be
relieved, when congested, by warm applications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back
of the neck, thus diverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or
an ice bag to the back of the neck.
—Also see ""Earache and Infection.""
EARACHE and INFECTION; MASTOIDITIS
(Otitis Externa and Media)
SYMPTOMS—One or both ears ache. This is frequently accompanied by infection in the middle ear.
The pain will be worse at night because the body is prone (flat) and it is more difficult for the eustachian
tubes to drain out the phlegm.
Sometimes the ears will ache because there is trouble with the teeth (referred pain), but this is not
common.
CAUSES—Infection of the outer or middle ear causes pressure to build up. This pressure on nerve
endings causes pain. But, if there were no pain, there might be no warning that a serious ear problem
existed.
Otitis externa is infection in the outer ear. The eardrum through the length of the eustachian tube
becomes swollen and inflamed. There is a slight fever, discharge from the ear, pain (which increases
when the ear is touched or pulled), and temporary loss of hearing.
Otitis media is infection in the middle ear, and is especially common in infants and children. The
infection is located behind the eardrum, where the small ear bones are located. There is earache,
fullness, pressure in the ear, and a fever as high as 103o F. or higher.
Here is an ear test: if you can wiggle your outer ear (the part you can see) without pain, you probably
have a middle ear infection; if there is pain, the infection is in the eustachian tube.
Going into higher altitudes can push phlegm, already in the eustachian tube, into the middle ear. Never
sleep on your ear if you have a head cold and the vehicle is moving upward to a higher elevation.
Infection in the inner ear generally results from meningitis or from the spread of a middle-ear infection.
Symptoms include loss of hearing, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and fever.
Earache is a common childhood infection. Most children experience it. It is easier for a child to have an
ear infection, since his eustachian tube is shorter than that of an adult. Causes include childhood
diseases, allergies, colds, and respiratory infections.
If they are frequent, ear infections can lead to loss of hearing.
Chronically enlarged adenoids may cause blockage of the eustachian tubes, leading to congestion and
fluid buildup in the middle ear.
There is a tendency for people who have ear problems to be heavy earwax producers. To reduce the
amount of earwax made, eat less unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are not a problem.
TREATMENT FOR INFECTION—
• If you seem to have pain in the ear, pull on the earlobe. If the pain increases, then you
probably have an ear infection. If the pain does not increase, you may have a dental
problem.
• Keep the ears warm and the person resting in bed, preferably with his head and, perhaps
also, his trunk slightly elevated (to assist natural drainage of the eustachian tubes).
Surgical draining might be necessary. The fever increases the need for vitamins A and C.
Keep the feet warm. Heat applied to the feet will draw blood from the head and improve
circulation.
• Sit up when practical to do so, to decrease the swelling and start the tubes draining.
Swallowing will help ease the pain. Yawning really helps open up the eustachian tubes.
• Blow warm air from a hair dryer 18-30 inches from the ear, and blow air toward it.
• Warm some oil to body temperature, and place a drop or two in the ear. This will help
lessen pain. But do not do this if you think the drum has burst!
• A helpful method, used by many for a long time is this: To alleviate pain in the ear, use a
little olive oil or garlic oil in the ear, then add a drop or two of lobelia tincture.
• Another way to reduce pain is to make a paste, using onion powder or clay packs. Then
apply this to the outside of the ear.
• Bake a large onion until it becomes soft, and tie it over the ear; this will often give great
relief when pain is severe.
• Avoid sugar, dairy products, meat, and heavy meals until the crisis is past. Herbal teas
are helpful in assisting the healing process. This includes peppermint, echinacea,
goldenseal, pau d'arco, and slippery elm.
• Because they increase sticky mucous in the body, dairy products increase ear infections.
Excessive sweets and starches lower resistance and intensify ear problems.
• People with a tendency to ear infection should avoid all cow's milk products. But, in
addition to producing so much mucous, it is reported that milk allergies can produce
earaches (and even a burst eardrum), simulating otitis media—without an ear infection
actually existing.
• Avoid cigarette smoke, for it can irritate the eardrum.
• Place drops of hydrogen peroxide in the ear, to help clean it out. Then rinse out with
water. Do not leave the peroxide there. It can sink through the eardrum and produce a
fizzing sound which can last for several years.
• Take garlic enemas. These will help disinfect the body of higher levels of toxins that are
building up from the infection. Signs of this are chills, fever, general aches, and pain
increase.
TREATMENT FOR RUPTURE—
What should you do if the eardrum ruptures? Causes include a severe ear infection, sudden pressure
inward on the ear, resulting from diving, slapping, a strong kiss to the ear, or a nearby explosion.
During an ear infection, pus builds up and causes pain in the ear. If this pus starts leaking to the outside,
then the eardrum has ruptured.
• In case the eardrum ruptures, put nothing in the ear until the eardrum is healed. A
fomentation on the outside of the ear can be helpful.
• Once the infection increases to acute pain, you may need antibiotics.
• An alternate method is: When the ear has abscessed and broken, use warm peroxide to
wash the ear out. The peroxide will loosen the putrefied matter and bring it out of the ear.
This method is probably good for cleaning out the ear; but keep in mind that hydrogen
peroxide is best used on outside body surfaces, where oxygen can cause it to fizz into
harmlessness. When it gets inside sensitive body parts, it can continue there for quite
some time. We know of one individual who had peroxide in his ear for several years
thereafter; and, every so often, he could hear it lightly fizzing.
• When using water therapy on the ear, be guarded. Hot applications over the area under
the ear could cause trouble!
- Also see ""Swimmer's Ear.""
HYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments mentioned in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual
(see order sheet):
Irrigation of the Ear: A lean rubber tube is used to gently (gently!) introduce a flow of
water onto the outer ear. The water is never applied with any pressure! It flows to the ear
and out to the side. The temperature may be from 100o to 120o F., depending upon the
effect desired. The source of water should be on a level with the top of the head (to
maintain only a slight pressure). Never use force, because perforation of the ear often
exists; and serious injury could result from introduction of water, with any degree of
force, into the middle ear. The head should be inclined to the side as the water is applied.
The canal of the ear should afterward be carefully dried and covered with a cloth or a
warm hand for a few minutes. In cold weather, the ear should not be exposed out-of-doors
for at least an hour after warm ear irrigation is applied; and, even after that, a small piece
of cotton should be placed in the outer passageway.
This measure affords great relief in the pain of acute otitis media and earache due to other
causes. In chronic suppurative disease of the ear, this measure is indispensable as a means
of cleansing and disinfection (p. 151).
Draining the middle ear: Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and
face, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the
Hot Compress extends below the jaw, the common carotid artery will be dilated
(enlarged), which you do not want. An ice bag should be placed below the jaw at the same
time, and will increase the effect by contracting the carotid.
Draining the inner ear: The inner ear problem may be relieved, when congested, by warm
applications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back of the neck, thus
diverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or an
ice bag to the back of the neck (p. 194).
Inflammation of ear: Fomentation over affected part; derivative treatment to legs: Hot Leg
Bath, Hot Foot Bath, Prolonged Leg Pack (p. 210).
Inflammation of middle ear: Ice to throat of the same side, Fomentation over ear (p. 221).
Earache: Ice Bag to the neck of the same side; Fomentation over ear; Hot Ear Douche, if
necessary. Protect the ear with warm cotton, to prevent chilling by evaporation after
treatment (p. 224).
Eustachian tube inflammation: The Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold
cloth, covered with flannel, which then heats up and results in improved circulation and a
better flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted area. Wring the cotton cloth
from cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3 thicknesses about
the neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit the
flannel snugly but not too tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it
the next morning. It should be entirely dry. In eustachian tube inflammation, the compress
should extend upward about the lower part of the ear. You may need to hold up this part
of the compress (the part by the lower part of the ear) with a bandage that is fastened to it
and goes over the top part of the head and back down to it on the other side (pp. 51-53).
PREVENTION—
• Never dive below 3-4 feet below the surface of the water.
• Never sleep in a plane or vehicle when it is descending—or ascending. If you are in a
car, climbing up or down the mountains—do not sleep, especially on your side. You do
not swallow as often when you are asleep; and, if you have phlegm in your sinuses, it can
go up into your ears.
• Be careful when scuba diving. The greatest air pressure changes occur within the first 33
feet below the surface. Avoid earplugs and hoods which are too tight-fitting, so you
cannot equalize air pressure in the ears.
• Avoid the above three situations, when your head is stuffy with phlegm.
• Breast-feeding reduces a baby's chances of having ear trouble.
• Do not smoke.
—Also see ""Ear Congestion.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ will not be satisfied till the victory is complete in your life. He wants to
change you into a full overcomer. Do not fail Him. Let Him empower you to obey the Ten
Commandments."
disease-head-earwax,Earwax,"TREATMENT
• Never put anything sharp in the ear! That includes bobby pins, paper clips, and pencil
tips. They can puncture the eardrum.
• Do not use cotton-tipped swabs either, because they merely ram the wax down deeper
and impact it the more.
• Place something in your ear which will soften it. This can be hydrogen peroxide, mineral
oil, or glycerin. Add a drop or two of this to each ear. Let the excess run out. The liquid
left inside will soften the wax. Do this for a couple days.
• Fill a bowl with body-temperature water. Suck it into a rubber bulb syringe; and, holding
your head over the bowl, gently squirt the water into the ear. Use very, very little pressure.
Turn your head and let the water run out.
• Do not rub the ears, to dry them. Either use a hair dryer (18-20 inches away) or drop a
little alcohol in each ear. Do not wash out the ears in this manner more often than every
couple months. You need some earwax to protect your ears.
• There is a tendency for people who have ear problems to be heavy earwax producers. To
reduce the amount of earwax made, eat less unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty
acids are not a problem. It is the over-balance of unsaturated fats which causes the earwax
problem.
• An alternate method of cleaning out the earwax is this: Using an eyedropper, place either
a solution of 1 part vinegar to 1 part warm water or a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in
your ear. Allow it to settle for a minute, then drain it. Do this 2-3 times a day. If the wax is
hard and dry, apply garlic oil for a day or two, to soften it. Then wash out the ear with a
steady stream of warm water, under no pressure. Patiently continue irrigating the ear
canal, flushing with warm water. The wax buildup will come out.
• Yet another method is using ""ear candles,"" available at health food stores. Someone will
have to help you use them. Instructions come with the candles. Afterward, you may be
bothered by the fact that an excess of wax has been eliminated. You may need to put
cotton in each ear for a time.
ENCOURAGEMENT—One day alone is ours; and, during this day, we are to live for God. For this
one day we are to place in the hand of Christ all our purposes and plans, casting all our care upon Him,
for He careth for us.

SYMPTOMS—Hearing is becoming duller, and the person suspects he may be losing his hearing.
CAUSES—The problem may a hard plug of earwax in the ear canal. Some people have constant ear
pain until the excess wax is cleaned out.
If you do not chew your food thoroughly, earwax can build up. The chewing tends to break it down.
Saturated fats contribute to excess production of earwax."
disease-head-swimmer-s-ear,Swimmer'S Ear,"TREATMENT
• Hydrogen peroxide ear drops.
See ""Earache and Infection"" for additional help.
ENCOURAGEMENT—If you have given yourself to God, to do His work, you have no need to be
anxious for tomorrow. He will take care of that. Instead, just for today, live for Him, obey Him, and be a
blessing to all around you.

SYMPTOMS—An ache and/or infection in one or both ears, after swimming in a pond, creek, or public
swimming pool.
CAUSES—Swimmer's ear occurs when pool water remains in the outer ear canal too long. Bacteria or
fungi in the water increases the chance of infection. When swimming in contaminated water, keep your
head out of the water.
The pool water, having repeatedly wet and softened the earwax, caused it to become an ideal place for
bacteria to grow.
But the most common cause is infection from the nasal passages and throat, having been pushed into the
eustachian tube when the nose was blown too hard.
Constant swimming throughout the summer can result in infestation of the external ear canal by candida
albicans. Constant dampness (in water that is not entirely clean) throughout the summer swimming
season is thought to be the cause."
disease-head-hearing-loss,Hearing Loss,"TREATMENT
• Consider the above factors.
• Clean the ears, make sure manganese and tin are in the diet (take Nova Scotia dulse or
Norwegian kelp). Take pulse tests and gradually eliminate food allergies. If milk is the
problem, cut out all milk products from the diet. Avoid medicinal drugs, chemicals, and
loud noises
• Eat a wholesome, nutritious diet, with vitamin/mineral supplements. Drink fresh
vegetable juices.
• Eliminate processed, sugared, and junk foods from the diet.
• In case there is an inflammation in the ear which causes the hearing loss: Mullein oil
can be put in the ear as ear drops. 2-4 drops of warm (not hot) garlic oil or liquid extract is
also good. Do not use the same dropper in both ears, as it may spread the infection. Eat
fresh pineapple.
• If you seem to have pain in the ear, pull on the earlobe. If the pain increases, then you
probably have an ear infection. If the pain does not increase, you may have a dental
problem.
PREVENTION—Always wear ear protection when using appliances or equipment which produce loud
noises. This would include power tools, chain saws, lawn mowers, table or portable saws, and target
practice. Use ear plugs rated for at least twice as many decibels as you need, to ensure protection.
When listening to music, it should never be so loud you cannot hear the ring of the doorbell or the
telephone. If you use earphones, no one else should be able to hear sound from your earphones. If they
can, you are playing the music too loud for the safety of your ears!
The average rock concert or stereo headset at higher levels (100 decibels, plus) can damage your hearing
in 30 minutes. Two hours in a video game arcade can do the same thing. By comparison, an air hammer
is 120 decibels.
Wear ear plugs when swimming in public places.
Reduce your cholesterol level. Those with high cholesterol have greater hearing loss as they age.
Do not get German measles while you are pregnant. If you are vaccinated for it, do not become pregnant
for 3 months afterward. The ensuing birth defects to the child could include hearing loss.
Beware of medications during pregnancy.
Make sure your infant has good hearing. If not discovered, he or she will miss much instruction in a
variety of speaking skills. Generally, you will be the first one to learn if such a problem exists, not the
doctor.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Bible reveals how we can be saved. From Eden lost to Eden restored, it
tells the entire story of salvation in Christ. Read that precious book, and you will be blessed and be a
blessing to others.

SYMPTOMS—One's sense of hearing is lessening.
CAUSES—It may be that the sense of hearing is being lost. But it also may be that the ear has too much
impacted earwax. (See ""Earwax"" for how to remove it.)
A manganese or tin deficiency in the diet can result in a hearing loss. Putting these back into the diet can
reverse this, and restore the hearing.
Other possible causes would include: Milk allergies, poor ear circulation, and vitamin A deficiency.
The ear drums might be hardened with age. This generally accompanies hardening of the arteries.
Catarrhal deafness could be the problem. This starts when an acute infection (such as a cold or the flu) is
suppressed and not allowed to run its course and be properly eliminated. A low level infection continues
in the ear, and gradually ruins the hearing.
When acute diseases are treated with aspirin or quinine, partial or complete deafness can result. Other
drugs which cause this effect are aureomycin, streptomycin, barbiturates, cocaine, opium, and their
derivatives.
Smoking and caffeine cause spasms and narrowing of blood vessels.
Other substances to avoid would include lead, mercury, and cadmium.
Excessive amounts of noise injures the fine structures in the inner ear and gradually produces deafness.
Some people have occupational hazards which eventually lead to deafness. This includes piloting small
planes and running chain saws or heavy equipment."
disease-head-sore-throat,Sore Throat,"TREATMENT
• Sip liquid vitamin C. Let it drip down the throat slowly (all the while trying to keep the
acid C off the teeth, so it will not melt them). Coat the throat with raw honey mixed with
lemon juice. Gargle with salty water (½ tsp. sea salt in a cup of water).
• Drink plenty of fluids—fruit and vegetable juices and lots of water. Go to bed, rest, trust
in God, and get well.
• Use a mixture of raw honey and lemon juice, to coat and soothe the throat.
• Gargle alternately with chlorophyll liquid and sea salt (one half tsp. in a glass of warm
water) every few hours.
• Enemas are very helpful.
• Herbs include eucalyptus, flaxseed, garden sage, German chamomile, and myrtle. Both
goldenseal and echinacea fight bacterial and viral infection. (But do not take goldenseal
over a week at a time, or during pregnancy.) Gargling with fenugreek tea will help relieve
a sore throat. Marshmallow root tea soothes a scratchy, itchy throat. Hot mullein poultices
soothe sore throats.
• An old herb doctor makes these suggestions: Gargle the throat with cayenne pepper tea,
a half tsp. to a cup. Put an onion poultice on the neck over night, for 2-3 nights. Rub
kerosene on the outside of the neck and cover it with warm flannel.
HYDRO—The following is from the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):
The Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold cloth, covered with flannel, which then heats
up and results in improved circulation and a better flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted
area. Wring the cotton cloth from cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3
thicknesses about the neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit
the flannel snugly but not so tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it the next
morning. It should be entirely dry (pp. 51-53).
Give a Hot Foot Bath (p. 116).
A Steam Bath is very helpful (pp. 131-135).
ENCOURAGEMENT—With the trusting faith of a little child, come to your heavenly Father. Tell
Him all your needs. He is always ready to pardon and help. He can give you the guidance you need. He
can give you strength to resist sin and obey His law.
LARYNGITIS—1
(Hoarseness; Aphonia)
SYMPTOMS—A tickling, raw, throat is the initial symptom. The voice becomes hoarse and weak, or it
is lost entirely for a time (aphonia). The voice loss is frequently all that happens, and no fever or
infection accompanies it.
CAUSES—""Hoarseness"" is when it is with difficulty that you can speak; ""aphonia"" is when you have
totally lost your voice. The cause of either is generally too much loud speaking, yelling, or the onset of a
cold or upper respiratory tract infection.
• Do not talk. Try to avoid any speaking for a day or two. Do not even whisper. Just write
notes.
Go on a short fruit and vegetable juice fast. This will help remove excess mucous.
• Drink lots of liquids, 8-10 glasses a day, but do not drink cold drinks or anything with
ice in it.
• Breathe through your nose. This increases the humidity in your throat. Air in an airliner
is very dry (because it is pressurized), so do not breath through your mouth if you are on a
plane.
• Put your head over a hot bowl of water for 5 minutes, twice a day.
• Do not smoke.
• Helpful herbs include the following: slippery elm plus lemon and honey, which is very
soft and soothing on the throat. This is an outstanding help.
• The ""singer's plant"" is hedge mustard (sisymbrium officinale). Take it as a liquid extract.
• Make a syrup out of wild cherry bark and take a little at a time.
• Drink 1 cup of eyebright tea, 3-4 times a day.
• Gargle with goldenseal tea, and drink some.
• Mix 2 tbsp. flaxseed and 1 tbsp. horehound. Boil in 1 pint of water for 10 minutes and
strain. Squeeze 1 lemon into the tea, add a pinch of ginger. Take 1 tbsp. every half hour.
• Do not take aspirin. It increases clotting time, which can slow the healing process.
• Learn to avoid loud speaking. Train yourself to speak more softly. If you have something
worth hearing, they will listen to you.
• When you feel the slightest indication of hoarseness coming on, cancel your speaking
engagements.
• Eating mucous-forming foods, such as dairy products, meat, candy, and wheat can
produce hoarseness. Talking in a tense voice can also. Drinking liquids with a meal tends
to do it also.
• Learn to breathe and speak more correctly, without straining. Stop losing your temper.
Gargle a quart of cold water every day.
• Drink and gargle with herb teas of wild cherry bark, mullein, and/or vervain.

ENCOURAGEMENT—There is no safeguard against evil except surrender to Christ, studying the
Bible, obeying it, and living to help others.
LARYNGITIS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
(1) ACUTE FORM —
GENERAL CARE—See ""Nasal Catarrh, Part 1: Catarrh, Acute."" Steam Inhalation, for 10 minutes,
hourly; Heating Compress to throat without plastic covering; avoid use of voice while very hoarse.
(2) CHRONIC FORM —
INCREASE GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE AND INVIGORATE THE SKIN—Graduated
Cold Baths; sweating baths or prolonged Neutral Bath at night, 2-3 times a week. Follow sweating
procedure by any suitable cold application.
TO RELIEVE LOCAL CONGESTION—Steam Inhalation for 10 minutes, every 4 hours;
Fomentation at night, followed by well-protected Cold Compress to the neck, to be worn during the
night.
COUGH—See under ""Croup.""
—See ""Laryngitis—1.""

SYMPTOMS—The throat becomes sore and scratchy. This is often the first sign of an infection.
CAUSES—A variety of bacterial or virus infections can cause sore throat. Those which are of
Streptococcus Group A origin tend to produce a higher fever than viral sources (upper respiratory
infections, cold viruses, flu, etc.).
Anything irritating to the throat can initiate the problem (such as chronic coughing and loud talking).
Other irritants include smoke, dust, fumes, very hot foods or drinks, abrasions, tooth and gum infections,
loud talking, or chronic coughing.
Smoking is a major cause of sore throats.
Bacteria on toothbrushes can cause sore throats. Buy a new toothbrush or boil the old one at least once a
month. Between uses, store the toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide—but rinse it well before using.
If a sore throat continues or recurs, it might be the onset of mononucleosis (especially if the sore throat
lasts more than 2 weeks). Do not dally; go to bed and get well. A sore throat can be the first sign of
something more serious: a cold; the flu; mononucleosis; herpes simplex; Epstein-Barr virus; or several
childhood diseases, such as chickenpox or the measles. Sometimes a sore throat can lead to chronic
fatigue syndrome, gingivitis, epiglottitis, diphtheria, laryngeal cancer, or an abscess around the tonsils.
A continual throat tickle could be an indication of a food allergy."
disease-head-tooth-decay,Tooth Decay,"TREATMENT
• Do not drink cola drinks. Do not eat sticky foods. Do not eat white sugar products.
• Rinse out your mouth after eating or finish a fruit meal by eating an apple.
• Goldenseal extract, that is alcohol-free, can be used as a antibacterial mouthwash.
• To reduce infection in a tooth, put a few drops of goldenseal extract on a piece of cotton
and apply it to the swollen area at night. For 3 consecutive nights, do this.
• Eat plenty of raw fruits and vegetables.
• Do not chew up vitamin C tablets! The acid in them will melt your teeth.
• Avoid all toothpastes and powders. Detergents in them are harmful to teeth and gums.
• It is vital that you take calcium supplement, in order to maintain good tooth and bone
structure. As you get older, you need even more calcium.
• Massage gums with your finger once a day.
TO STOP A TOOTHACHE—Until you can see a dentist, here are several suggestions:
• Swish warm salt water in your mouth, and spit it out. Do this after every meal and before
retiring at night. Stir 1 tsp. of salt into a glassful of water, at body temperature.
• Somewhat warm salt water, held in the mouth will bring relief.
• Apply 1-2 drops of oil of cloves to the affected tooth with a cotton swab. If the oil seems
too strong, dilute it with olive oil.
• Rinse your mouth vigorously with a mouthful of lukewarm water. If the pain is from
food caught between the teeth, this may flush it out.
• Try flossing gently between the teeth.
• Put a charcoal tablet in your mouth and, with your tongue or cheek, press it against the
swollen gum at the base of the problem tooth.
• Drink 1-2 cups of mullein tea or chew catnip herb.
• Mash up the root of plantain and put it on the cheek near the tooth.
• With your fingers rub an ice cube until one side is shaped into a V-shape. Then press it
gently against the tender place, and push it back and forth over the area for 5-7 minutes.
The effect of rubbing tends to cancel out the pain signal, which must travel along the same
nerve route.
• Keep heat away from the tooth and nearby cheek. If it is an infection, the heat will draw
the infection to the outside of the jaw and make the situation worse.
• Put ice on the nearby cheek for 15 minutes, 3-4 times a day.
• Avoid biting on that area of the teeth.
• Some individuals have found that, when a toothache begins, they quickly skip a meal,
rest, take vitamin C, and conduct themselves very carefully over the next several
days—and the infection in the tooth is overcome by the body.
DENTAL FILLINGS—Many books have been written on this subject in recent years. When you go to
the dentist, he drills out the decayed part, and then fills the cavity with something hard which, hopefully,
will last awhile.
The most common substance used for this filling is amalgam. This is a mixture of several metals, of
which about 50% is always an extremely toxic chemical, called mercury. Mercury tends to evaporate
slowly over a period of time. This influx of mercury, swallowed with your food day after day, is not the
best for your health.
Alternatives are ceramic-based materials, gold, or platinum-type metals. They are more expensive, but
less harmful. They do not gradually melt away, as does mercury in amalgam.
FLUORIDE TREATMENTS—Even more books have been written about fluoride! This deadly poison
should be avoided at all costs. If it is added to your public drinking water supply, then you should buy
bottled water (or buy a home distiller, to process your faucet water). If your dentist offers to give you
fluoride treatments, you would do well to politely decline the opportunity.
AIR ABRASION TECHNOLOGY—Air abrasion dental work is the latest hi-tech method of drilling
teeth. It is said to painlessly remove tooth decay without drilling; it permits dentists to make smaller
fillings and save a large percentage of the tooth. In addition, it does not require pain-killing anesthetics.
ENCOURAGEMENT—In the Bible, the will of God is revealed. He who makes these truths a part of
his life becomes, in every sense, a new creature. God can do for you what you never could do for
yourself. But it requires total submission and obedience to His Written Word.

(Dental Caries; Toothache)
SYMPTOMS—A cavity or hole develops in a tooth, but may not be noticed until it begins to be
painful.
CAUSES—The outer part of the tooth (the very hard enamel) erodes, and then the body of the tooth
beneath it (the dentin) begins eroding also. This is called tooth decay.
It is thought that plaque buildup (a sticky mass on the surface of the tooth) provides a place for bacteria
to grow and feed on sugars in the mouth. The acid they produce digs holes in the teeth. If not stopped,
the erosion enters the lower, center part of the tooth, called the pulp, where the nerve is. Then the pain
begins. We call it a toothache.
However, certain things help produce tooth decay. These include sugary foods, sticky foods, and acid
foods.
Cola drinks do an excellent job of melting teeth. Coca Cola, and similar cola beverages, contain
phosphoric acid and lots of sugar. Frankly, the fluid is so terribly acid that it would be intolerable
without lots of sugar to mask the acidity. Acid, sugar, and phosphorous are very dangerous when
combined. The powerful acid melts part of the teeth, and the phosphorous chemically locks with the
melted calcium, and quickly carries it off. All that sugar does its part to ruin the teeth also. It helps the
bacteria to jump in and start still more trouble. Drop a tooth into a glass of Coke; then time the number
of hours before the tooth totally disappears."
disease-head-heartburn,Heartburn,"TREATMENT
• Immediately drink a large glass of water. This will help wash the HCl back down and
dilute it as well.
• Drink some raw potato juice. Whiz up an unpeeled potato and drink it down.
• Do not lie down. Remain upright, so gravity can help push the HCl down and keep it
down. Later, when you do lie down, elevate the bed at the head by 4 inches.
• Avoid bending over; if you must lift something, bend at the knees. You do not want to
compress your stomach when you have heartburn.
• Eating mints relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, so HCl can crowd up into the
esophagus.
• Do not drink anything caffeinated, for it will irritate the esophagus even more. Caffeine
relaxes the sphincter, so stomach contents can move on up. Tobacco smoke also relaxes
the sphincter. Estrogens relax it also.
• Drinking milk may feel good going down, but it encourages the stomach to secrete more
acid.
• Drinks with fizz in them expand the stomach and make it more likely that HCl will come
up the food pipe.
• Greasy, fried, and fatty foods sit in the stomach for a long time and increase HCl
production. Avoid meat and dairy products.
• Antidepressants and sedatives aggravate heartburn. Aspirin and ibuprofen cause
heartburn.
• Antacids only mask the symptoms. They also contain aluminum.
• Avoid stress, for that increases HCl production also.
• Loosen your belt; better yet, wear suspenders.
• Do not eat within 2½ hours before bedtime. Doing so not only can cause heartburn, but
bring on heart attacks also.
• Eat more raw vegetables, chew your food well, and eat slowly.
• Angina and heart attack are both very dangerous conditions (which see). Among the
earliest symptoms is, what appears to be, an ""acid stomach."" Beware. You are wise to eat
so that you do not have heartburn. Then if major heart trouble sends a warning message
that seems like heartburn, you will be less likely to sit back and take some aluminum,
from the drugstore, for ""antacid."" Aluminum is a cause of Alzheimer's disease (which
see).
ENCOURAGEMENT—Even on earth we may have joy as a wellspring, never failing, because it is fed
by the streams that flow from the throne of God. All this is ours as we study the Bible, and, in Christ's
strength, obey it.

(Acidosis, Overacid Stomach)
SYMPTOMS—A burning sensation in the stomach or chest.
CAUSES—Heartburn is a sense of burning in the stomach. In most instances, some of the stomach
digestive juices have backed up out of the stomach into the esophagus (the food tube between the mouth
and the stomach). This backing-up action is called reflux. These juices include hydrochloric acid, which
is a rather powerful acid. It is used in industry, to clean metal. When it comes in contact with the
esophagus, it burns the wall. Normally, the esophageal sphincter muscle shuts and prevents stomach
acids from pushing upward.
Heartburn can be caused by excessive consumption of fatty or fried foods, alcohol, coffee, spicy foods,
chocolate, or just having too much food in the stomach. Citrus fruits or tomato-based foods cause it in a
few people.
Other contributing factors are hiatal hernia, allergies, stress, gallbladder problems, and enzyme
deficiencies."
disease-head-reye-s-syndrome,Reye'S Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• It would be well for the child to be given vitamin C (5-10 gms per day), intravenously;
vitamins B-complex and B , and selenium (250-500 mcg per day) intramuscularly.
12
• If, in the hospital, the child receives an IV solution of glucose and electrolytes (mineral
salts) within 12-24 hours after the heavy vomiting begins, his chances of recovery are very
good.
• Never give a child or youth aspirin after a fever. The pattern of events is this: The child
has a fever, and aspirin is given. There is improvement for a day or two,—then a sudden
turn for the worst occurs, and coma or death follows. A Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) study revealed that 96% of the children contracting Reye's syndrome had been
given aspirin while they had a viral infection. It was also found that there was a direct
correlation between the amount of aspirin given and the severity of the illness.
• In this emergency, if you have to give him a pain reliever, give him acetaminophen
(Tylenol, Datril, and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, and others) instead.
• Children's aspirins are banned in Britain because of this problem.
• The drug, Tigan, used in suppository form, to control vomiting and nausea, may also be
a cause of Reye's.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Often our trials are such that they seem almost unbearable. Yet, without help
from God, they are unbearable. Go to Him just now, and find in Him the peace of heart you so much
need.
Section 14
Birth and Children
Part 6
Later Problems

SYMPTOMS—A fever and vomiting suddenly occur. A rapid change in mental status to a deep
depression, nausea, amnesia; and then pneumonia, coma, convulsions, fixed and dilated pupils, and
death.
There can be confusion, drowsiness, memory lapses, lethargy, irritability or unusual belligerence.
There may be weakness or paralysis in the limbs, speech impairment, hearing loss, double vision, etc.
CAUSES—Reye's Syndrome is a disaster worth avoiding. This disease affects many internal organs,
especially the brain and liver.
It primarily strikes children between the ages of 4 and 15 (but most frequently young teens), in the fall
or winter.
Not long ago, the death rate stood at 42%-80%, but more recently it has dropped to below 10%.
Most cases occur after a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox. Influenza B, Epstein-Barr virus,
and viruses which primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract (enteroviruses) can also occur prior to its
onset.
It is known that giving aspirin to a child or youth who has a fever can lead to Reye's disease and the
likely possibility of death. In the early 1980s, it was discovered that a viral infection, plus the taking of
aspirin, dramatically increases the risk of developing Reye's syndrome.
The cause of the disease may be consumption of aflatoxin, which is an exotoxin of the grain mold,
aspergillus flavus.
A biopsy generally shows liver necrosis (the liver is dying). Yet, if the person survives, there is a full
recovery of the liver within 12 weeks.
If you see the above symptoms, just after your child has come out of a viral illness—do something
quickly! Here are the key symptoms again:
(1) Agitation, disorientation, and delirium.
(2) Fatigue, lethargy, and lapses in memory.
(3) Prolonged and heavy vomiting, followed by drowsiness.
Call a physician! Phone 911, and send the child to a hospital!"
disease-head-sorrow-of-the-heart,Sorrow Of The Heart,"• As far back as the second century A.D., the Greek physician Galen noted that melancholic women
were more likely than others to develop cancer.
• Today, the effect of emotions and stress (or rather the attitude toward stress) is recognized even more.
Over the past 75 years a number of studies have linked stress to susceptibility to cancer (R. Ader,
Psychoneuroimmunology, 1981). Strong stress in a child can also lead to it (B.L. Bloom, et. al.,
Psychological Bulletin 85 no. 4, 1978). Adults who who had recently lost a loved one, or were widowed,
divorced, or separated, have the highest cancer rates (B.L. Ernster, Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, 63, no. 3, 1979).
• Ronald Grossarth-Maticek, M.D., a European researcher, spent 20 years working along a line of study
which has been rejected by orthodox medicine. His concept is called Creative Novation Behavior
Therapy, and it concerns people with certain personalities; that is, having certain mental-emotional
attitudes, are the most likely to contract cancer.
• Grossarth-Maticek is a Yugoslavian oncologist (cancer specialist) who used mortality data in
Heidelberg, Germany.
• People who view life in a certain way are more prone to develop cancer.
• Type C persons are unable to solve problems in relationships with other persons, situations, and goals.
When relationships are crushed, circumstances go back, or goals become unachievable, these people
react by sinking into a depression, characterized as feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Type C
people are highly prone to cancer.
• Type H persons also have the same difficulties named above, but they react quite different to such
problems. Instead of feeling hopeless and helpless, they become angry and frustrated. Type H people
tend to develop heart disease.
• Type F persons learn how to roll with the punches. They are free of fears and worries, for they give
them into God's hands to care for. Although they encounter problems as others do, they trust in God,
recognize their own limitations, and, when difficulties arise, keep moving forward cheerfully. This type
tends to die of other causes, such as accidents. They tend not to die of cancer or heart or circulatory
problems.
• These people are not living under stress, with aroused hormonal flow, such as type 1 and 2
personalities have. They are at peace with life. They accept what has to be, change whatever they can
change, and, with God's help, keep cheerfully on their way, helping others as they go.
• Still other researchers have found other aspects of this Type C (cancer-prone) personality.
The main aspect they have noted is loss, either loss of a loved one, or loss of hope. Many cancer patients
feel a profound sense of helplessness and despair, particularly about the meaning of their existence.
Frequently, they need peace with God.
• A second characteristic is the suppression or repression, of emotions.
• The third factor is loneliness. Such people tend not to have close friends. (H. Dreher, Your Defense
Against Cancer, 1988, 246-247.)
• All three factors could be nicely resolved if such individuals would come to God and find in Him the
encouragement, the forgiveness, and strength they need to meet life's difficulties."
disease-musculoskeletal-fracture,Fracture,"TREATMENT
• Obtain a nourishing diet. (See ""Bones, Strengthening,"" just below.)
• Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme which acts to reduce swelling and
inflammation. Eat half a fresh (not canned or processed) pineapple daily, until the fracture
heals. Canned pineapple or pineapple juice may contain aluminum salts, pulled by the acid
from the can by the very acid liquid.
• During healing, the diet should include enough calories in order to provide the energy
necessary for new bone-cell formation.
• You may use clay poultices to alleviate bruising and swelling.
• Helpful herbs include comfrey and alfalfa. Also helpful are plantain and mistletoe.
• Also place comfrey over the site of the fracture, to speed healing and reduce pain and
swelling.
• Too much calcium supplementation, during bone healing, can induce kidney stone
formation during the immobile period while the cast is on. The problem is that the person
is not active enough at that time.
—For detailed information on rebuilding the bones, see ""Bones, Strengthening.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The grace of Christ and the law of God are inseparable. In Jesus, mercy and
truth are met together. By His death and mediation, Jesus can forgive our sins and enable us to resist
temptation and live clean, godly lives.
# BONES, STRENGTHENING
PREVENTIVE MEASURES—You cannot succeed in life without good bones. The bones most likely
to be damaged by lack of care includes the jawbone, teeth, spine, hip, legs, and joints—all very
important.
The objective is to achieve the highest possible bone mass before old age, and then to maintain it as long
as possible. The following recommendations will help you fulfill these objectives:
The body requires calcium for many things, although bones are the most obvious need. For example,
there has to be a certain amount of calcium in the blood all the time. But when, for one reason or
another, the intake of certain minerals is not adequate, calcium is reabsorbed out of the bones in order to
supply other needs elsewhere. (One of these needs is providing calcium to a growing fetus during
pregnancy.) The bones become porous and ""honeycombed,"" and so fragile that breaks can more easily
occur.
A major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb
calcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of
certain hormones.
Obtaining enough nutrients, through diet and supplements, is important to maintaining strong bones.
Calcium at 2,000 mg a day, magnesium at 1,000 mg per day, along with plant-derived colloidal minerals
is needed.
Digestive aids may be needed to help absorb this and other minerals. Especially important is sufficient
acid in the stomach. Either betaine HCl (hydrochloric acid supplement) or lemon juice can be taken.
Calcium and minerals are found abundantly in natural foods such as green leafy vegetables, carrot juice,
and broccoli. The green leafy vegetables are generally the best sources. Along with them ranks sesame
seeds. They are the best ratio of high calcium and low phosphorous of any food.
A dietary calcium/phosphorous ratio of 2:1 is ideal, yet can only be attained by taking calcium
supplements. Here are some samples of this ratio of calcium to phosphorous in several foods: grain -
1:8; red meat - 1:12; organ meat (liver, kidney) - 1:44; fish - 1:12; carbonated drinks - 1:8.
People who eat meat and/or drink various colas and sodas obtain an immense amount of phosphorous.
Millet is rich in calcium and magnesium. Almonds are high in calcium. The grains, amaranth and
quinoa, are rich in minerals.
Fruitarians (people who only eat fruit) do not get enough calcium or the magnesium needed to help the
calcium be utilized.
Eat plenty of vegetables, raw and steamed.
Other foods high in calcium include brown rice, kale, turnip greens, pinto beans, spirulina, collard
greens, and sesame seeds.
Those with dentures tend to find vegetables difficult to eat. This results in a magnesium and calcium
deficiency. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw vegetable juices daily.
Lack of hydrochloric acid can be a cause of poor calcium (and other mineral) absorption.
Vitamin D is necessary (400-1,000 IU daily) for calcium absorption and repair. You need a basic 400 IU
daily. Sunlight will help you get part of what you need. (It is estimated that, on the average, only 10% of
our daily requirement comes from sunlight; so other sources are also needed.) People over 65 may need
800 units daily.
In one study, the more sunlight that was obtained by the test group, the less likelihood of osteoporosis
developing.
But excess doses of vitamin D, taken repeatedly, caused bone deterioration.
Potassium is needed for cell formation, and vitamin C is necessary for the maintenance and development
of bones. Vitamin C is called ""cell cement""; it not only fights infection, but also holds your body
together!
Garlic, onions, and eggs contain sulfur, which is needed for healthy bones.
Manganese helps prevent osteoporosis (loss of bone mass). Rats on a low manganese diet developed
porous bones.
Vitamin A helps increase the rate of bone growth. It is needed for proper digestion and assimilation of
nutrients.
Vitamin B complex helps bone mass formation. B increases connective tissue strength in bones.
6
Vitamin K (found in alfalfa, greens, and other chlorophyll foods) is needed to help the body synthesize
osteocalcin, a special protein matrix which attracts calcium to the bones.
Folic acid works to prevent the formation of toxic homocysteine from the essential amino acid,
methionine. The presence of homocysteine is involved in producing osteoporosis. (Alcohol, tobacco,
and oral contraceptives increase folic acid deficiency.)
Trace amounts of fluorides are also needed for bone development, but get it out of food—not from
additives, fluoridated water, toothpaste, etc.
The use of sodium fluoride, once thought to help treat osteoporosis, is now known to do the opposite.
While it does increase bone mass in the spine, the bone is inferior in quality. Woman receiving the
compound were three times more likely to fracture an arm, leg, or hip than if they took a placebo. As
little as 16 mg of sodium fluoride a day produces abnormal bone marrow cells. Adequate natural
fluoride is in all food and water sources.
Calcium supplements include calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium citrate, and calcium
gluconate. All of these dissolve well, so they are absorbed adequately.
The mineral, calcium, has to be combined with another substance in order that it might be maintained in
a stable compound (calcium lactate is calcium plus lactic acid). Calcium carbonate includes a somewhat
higher percentage of elemental calcium than do the other forms, but all are beneficial. (Calcium
carbonate not only has the highest amount of calcium per tablet, it is the least expensive form.) As with
most other supplements, calcium in powder form is more economical than in tablets.
It is important that there be sufficient acid in the stomach, in order to absorb the calcium and other
minerals from the food. An increasing lack of this acid, with age, is part of the reason why older people
do not absorb minerals as well and have poor bone structure. If necessary, take supplemental
hydrochloric acid (betaine HCl) or lemon juice before each meal.
Horsetail extract is a good source of silica, a vital mineral in the formation of bones. Horsetail, along
with oat straw, are consistently recommended as the best supplemental sources for absorbable silica.
Boron and silica, both needed for good bone formation, are found in horsetail and oat straw. When your
friends come over to visit, invite them to have some savory oat straw tea with you!
Alfalfa, comfrey, and slippery elm also help build strong bones.
Seaweed (Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp) is an good source of many major minerals, and an
outstanding source of the trace minerals.
Kelp, dulse, blue-green algae, hijiki, and kombu are rich in minerals. Wheat grass juice, green drink, and
liquid chlorophyll are also.
A summary of minerals which are needed includes silicon, boron, zinc, manganese, and copper, along
with calcium. (The body also needs phosphorous and magnesium, but too much of either one inhibits the
body from absorbing calcium. These minerals tend to compete with calcium for absorption in the blood
and bone marrow. In the case of magnesium, though, normal supplementation should not be a problem.)
The following substances remove calcium and other minerals from the food before it is digested or leach
it from the bones: white-sugar products, chocolate, caffeine products, and alcohol. Each of these are
harmful to the bones.
Vinegar and meat acids also diminish bone mass. This is because other dietetic acids are later changed to
alkaline forms after they leave the stomach, but not vinegar or meat acid (purines, uric acid, etc.)
It is well-known among medical professionals that sugar, coffee, caffeine, a high-meat diet, and smoking
produce osteoporosis and similar bone problems.
One study of middle-aged men and women with symptomatic osteoporosis were almost exclusively
heavy smokers.
A high-sugar diet causes calcium to be excreted in the urine. Excess sodium does this also.
Chocolate contains oxalic acid and prevents the absorption of calcium.
Women who drink coffee and soft drinks are more likely to have osteoporosis.
Certain foods contain oxalic acid in moderate amounts (the cabbage family, which includes kale,
collards, almonds, and asparagus), and some contain it in still larger amounts (chard and, especially,
spinach), and some in extremely large amounts (rhubarb, poke). Avoid oxalic acid foods, if you want
strong bones in your old age.
Some foods contain the calcium inhibitor, solanine. These include tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell
peppers, and tobacco.
Whole grains contain phytin, a substance which tends to bind with calcium and prevent its absorption
and use by the system. Some suggest that you take calcium supplements at different times than grains, to
insure its absorption. Those who are in desperate need for additional calcium will want to take this
advice. They can take calcium powder near bedtime, when it is best absorbed. Calcium also aids in
sleeping, for it tends to relax the muscles.
High phosphorous foods tend to compete with calcium and also combine with it, locking it out. Such
foods include soft drinks, high-protein animal foods, and yeast products.
Cola drinks are especially harmful in this respect. Cola drinks, frankly, are a terrible concoction: (1)
They contain an acid which is stronger than vinegar. (2) The acidity is masked by an excessive amount
of sugar, which itself leaches calcium from bones. (3) Cola drinks are basically phosphoric acid, or a
strong acid in a phosphorous medium. Phosphorous locks directly onto calcium, and carries it out of the
body, making it unavailable to the body. A tooth placed in a glass of cola drink will melt away entirely
within a few hours.
White-flour products contain chlorine, which is harmful to the bones.
Do not use foods with preservatives, because of their phosphorous content.
Drugs, such as diuretics, inhibit calcium assimilation.
Do not eat meat or vinegar if you want strong, healthy, joints. A diet high in animal protein tends to
causes the body to excrete increased amounts of protein. Beef, for example, contains 25 times as much
phosphorous as calcium! A high-meat diet will invariably lead to calcium deficiencies.
A study conducted by The Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that vegetarian women had
significantly less bone loss than women who eat meat.
Avoid large meals and overeating. Chew your food well, so it will be properly absorbed.
The amount of protein a man eats may influence the level of calcium in his body. Tests at Wisconsin
University, confirmed by other studies, revealed that a high-protein diet causes calcium loss. Eskimos,
on their high-protein diets, had lower bone mineral levels than Americans. In the 60-90 age bracket,
bone loss in meat eaters was 35%; in vegetarians it was 18%.
Excessive fat intake reduces bone mass. On test animals, the daily loss of calcium on the high-fat diet
was more than four times as much as on the low-fat diet.
The harder the fat was, before eating, the more calcium loss it caused.
Exercise strengthens the bones. It causes the body to strengthen the insides of the bones, by increasing
the webbing connections within them. Exercise definitely increases bone density. The body must have
regular weight-bearing exercise, such as walking. When this occurs, more minerals are laid down in the
bones, to strengthen them—especially where you need it the most: the bones of the legs, hips, and spine.
Conversely, a lack of exercise accelerates the loss of bone mass. It is believed that lack of activity in old
age is a factor in the increased levels of bone loss in those years.
Daily exercise outdoors provides vitamin D and stimulates osteoblastic cells. Exercise increases muscle
tone, strengthens muscles, prevents disuse atrophy and further demineralization of the bones.
NASA research experts say the best activity for maintaining bone mass is gravitational: walking or
jogging. When you are not pushing against gravity very much (because you are sitting in a chair or lying
in bed), you are tending to lose bony material. Try to walk at least 20 minutes a day out-of-doors.
""Strain changes"" are important in building and maintaining bone mass. How often you do it is more
important than the intensity when it is done. Try to maintain the bounce of earlier years: keep that spring
in your step; put a little strain on your body and muscles every so often. Do this more moderately as you
age, but keep it up.
Bed rest tends to cause a negative calcium balance. Bones placed in plaster casts develop localized
osteoporosis, regardless of the diet, hormonal balance, etc. It is called ""disuse osteoporosis."" Exercise is
vital to healthy bones.
Too much calcium supplementation, during bone healing (when in bed or confined to a chair while
recovering from a fracture, etc.), can induce kidney stone formation during the immobile period while
the cast is on. The problem is that the person is not active enough at that time.
Acidophilus in the large bowel is needed for the digestion of food. It is also needed to produce vitamins
B , B , and folic acid, all of which are needed to make bone mass. Lactic acid foods, such as
6 12
sauerkraut, are very helpful.
Supplementing your diet with two herbs, suma and dong quai, will help regulate hormonal imbalances.
Suma contains sitosterol. This increases natural estrogen production without stimulating an oversupply.
Flaxseed oil also helps the body produce needed hormones.
Avoid chilling. Rats exposed to cold stress developed bone mass which was less dense.
Distilled water is an excellent way to obtain pure water. But keep in mind that you must also be
including proper minerals in your diet, including some kelp or dulse, to replace the minerals lost by
drinking distilled water. (Distilled water is chemically hungry, and locks onto some minerals in your
body when you drink it.)
Do not take estrogen drugs because, although it increases bone mass somewhat, it also places the user at
high risk for cancer. Estrogen therapy initially increases bone formation, but eventually leads to
decreased bone mass and lack of response to the parathyroid hormone. Taking estrogen also increases
the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and myocardial infarction (heart attack).
If you take the thyroid hormone or an anticoagulant drug, increase the amount of calcium you take by 25-
50%.
Older people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures.
—Also see ""Fractures"" and ""Osteoporosis"" for additional information on factors affecting bone
formation and loss.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God's faithful ones are in the majority. They have all heaven on their side, in
the battle to fulfill God's will for their lives and resist temptation to sin. Go to Jesus and surrender to
Him, and He can give you all the help you need.

(Broken Bone)
SYMPTOMS—There may be extreme pain and tenderness in the injured area, a protruding bone, blood
under the skin, or swelling. There may be tingling, numbness, weakness, or paralysis below the fracture.
A digit, or limb, may be at an abnormal angle or there may be pain at a specific place on a bone.
A major fracture can cause a loss of pulse below the fracture, weakness, and inability to bear weight.
CAUSES—A fracture is a crack or break in a bone. If the skin over the bone remains intact, it is a
closed or simple fracture; if the bone breaks the skin, it is a compound fracture.
Accidents are not a common cause of broken bones, but the bone can also be weakened from
osteoporosis, bone tumors, or metabolic disease. A weakened bone can break much more easily—even
from a slip of the foot, a slight fall, or knocking against something.
Malnutrition can also be involved. There can be a deficiency of calcium and/or magnesium, or there may
be an improper calcium/phosphorous ratio.
A vibrating tuning fork can be placed against the area; if it causes pain, there is a fracture. X rays will
confirm whether it is a fracture or strain or sprain.
It is important that the bone be properly set, so it will not thenceforth be deformed, and not function as
well.
Older people do not absorb calcium and other minerals as well. This begins at 40, increases at 50, and
very much so beyond 60. It is believed that 200,000 hip fractures occur in people over 65 every year.
Very often, this results from osteoporosis. The bone has somewhat hollowed out and the break more
easily occurred.
Older people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures than other people their age.
When a break occurs, protein fibers form a bridgework between the two parts. Then calcium,
phosphorous, and silica are deposited between the protein fibers.
(Oddly enough, although phosphorous is needed for good bone formation, you will find, below, that it is
important that you avoid phosphorous foods if you want strong bones. This is due to the fact that
phosphorous is the one mineral which is abundantly found in food. Yet too much of it in a meal locks
into the calcium and removes it from the body.)
First aid includes covering any wound and immobilizing, or splinting, the broken part in the position it
was found (so the problem will not worsen during transport). Take the person to a physician or the
hospital, depending on the seriousness of the problem. Medical treatment involves placing the bones in
their proper position and keeping them there while healing occurs."
disease-musculoskeletal-bone-spur,Bone Spur,"TREATMENT
• Give vitamin C to bowel tolerance, along with vitamin E and magnesium.
• Correct the calcium/phosphorous ratio by taking 2,000 mg of calcium a day.
• Research indicates that plant-derived colloidal minerals tend to reverse spurs and
calcium deposits, without surgery, by remodeling the bones.
• Do not eat meat, coffee, sugar, and alcohol. These upset the mineral balance in the body
and retard healing.
• Temporarily avoid citrus fruit.
• A 1-2 week raw food fast can be helpful.
• Rubbing the bottom of the feet with ice will help draw healing blood to the area. In the
early morning, walk barefoot outside on the wet grass. Then come in and dry off; make
sure your feet are warm afterward.
• If the shoes are not comfortable, this can make the pain feel worse. Wear rubber heels on
your shoes, not leather. Adding heel cushions to your shoes may reduce pain.
• Avoid walking on hard surfaces.
• If you usually walk or jog for exercise, try cycling or swimming instead.
• It may be necessary to have the spur surgically removed, if it is too painful or irritating.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do not be enticed by seeming advantages or the advice of friends, to do
wrong. Cling to God and obey His Written Word, and you will have the help that He sees is best for you.

(Heel Spur)
SYMPTOMS—Possible pain at a place where the bone seems to protrude out from the body more than
it should.
CAUSES—A bone spur is a pointed growth on a bone. Occurring most frequently on the heel, the bone
sticks out and occasionally strikes against something, causing pain. Or there may be ongoing pain at the
site.
Bone spurs can cause the formation of tiny, painful, tumors at the end of some of the nerves in that area.
Those with problems with the heel are generally overweight or middle-aged. But they are also common
in those who have tendonitis, neuritis, arthritis, or alkalosis.
If bone pain is felt at an unusual bumpy, protruding, place, x rays will confirm whether the problem is
arthritis, fracture, bone spur, or possibly primary or metastic bone cancer."
disease-musculoskeletal-chronic-rheumatism,Chronic Rheumatism,"TREATMENT
• Diet changes, water drinking, and weight control are all very important.
• The amount of urates in the blood is keyed to dietary intake and the amount of body
weight. Many in middle life who initially experience the pain of gout are overweight.
• Those with gout need to reduce to 10-15% below calculated normal weight. However,
weight reduction must be done gradually, so as not to stir up more urates and temporarily
increase the number of gout attacks.
• Do not fast when you have gout. Doing so greatly increases the amount of uric acids in
the blood.
• Drink at least 2 quarts of water a day between gout attacks, not only to get rid of the uric
acid, but also to reduce the likelihood of kidney damage and kidney stones. Those with
gout tend to have kidney stones.
• A high-carbohydrate diet tends to increase uric acid excretion. In contrast, a high-fat diet
decreases excretion and may bring on a gout attack (even though they may be unsaturated
fats). Keep your diet low in protein and fat.
• A vegetarian diet is the best program for a person with gout.
• Avoid excessive food yeast.
• Eating cherries is very helpful. The uric acid level in the blood decreases and the attacks
tend to stop. They can be any type of cherries, and either fresh or canned (½ pound per
day). One or two tbsp. of cherry concentrate can be taken instead. If canned cherries are
used, only use water-packed ones; most have too much sugar and additives.
• Overeating tends toward gout.
Here are foods high in purines: liver, brains, kidneys, heart, anchovies, sardines, meat
extract, fish roes, herring, consommé, mussels, and sweet breads.
• Here are foods of lesser purine content: fowl, fish (except those listed above), other
seafoods, and other meats.
• Here are foods of moderate amounts: whole-grain cereals, lentils, peas, beans, asparagus,
mushrooms, oatmeal, cauliflower, and spinach.
• Here are the foods which have only small amounts of purines; foods containing
negligible amounts of purines: vegetables, fruits, refined cereals, cereal products, eggs,
milk, cheese.
• There are cases in which drinking large amounts of milk or eating lots of tomatoes
produced gout.
• Do not take any alcoholic beverage. Alcohol increases uric acid production and reduces
excretion of urates.
• Direct injury to a joint, tending toward gout, can bring on an acute attack.
• It is known that the skin can excrete uric acid, so baths will help.
• During acute attacks, keep the affected joint elevated and at rest.
• Hot fomentations for 15 minutes every 3 hours, to help relieve pain. But, to reduce pain,
some do better using cold applications.
• Mud packs, applied to the affected area, will absorb a fair amount of the uric acid.
• Charcoal is very helpful. Take it by mouth (12-16 tablets daily), and also lay charcoal
packs on the area.
• A compress of comfrey root or leaves, blended with water, helps relieve gout pain.
Apply for two hours or more, or overnight.
• Burdock will help clean uric acid deposits from the joints and other areas. Kelp, red
clover, and yucca help eliminate uric acid and other toxins.
• Colchicine is the primary drug medication for gout. But it causes nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, cramping, hair loss, anemia, liver damage, and decreased leukocytes and
platelets. Natural remedies can do the job better.
• A number of drugs increase uric acid levels, so it is best to avoid drugs. Diuretic drugs
are especially bad.

RHEUMATISM (CHRONIC) GENERAL CARE—The same as for ""Rheumatism, Acute,"" except
that the local applications are made to the muscles instead of to the joints. Sweating baths, especially the
Radiant Heat Bath and the Steam Bath; long Neutral Baths; Fomentation over painful parts, followed by
the well-protected Heating Compress; water drinking; aseptic diet.
GOUT—1
SYMPTOMS—Sudden attack, often in the middle of the night, of extreme pain and swelling of a joint
in the fingers or toes (usually the big toe). But it can affect the ankles, knees, hands, elbows, and wrists.
Motion or pressure greatly increases the pain. After the swelling subsides, the skin tends to itch and peel.
During attacks, there often is loss of appetite, stomach and intestinal problems, fever, and decreased
urine output.
CAUSES—Gout is an acute type of inflammatory arthritis, and occurs most often in people who are
overweight or eat rich foods, such as meat, gravies, spices, and alcohol.
The body cannot handle all the purines and other acids in the meat, and so these products settle in the
body. Uric acid is the end-product of the breakdown of purine compounds.
Gout typically attacks the smaller joints of the feet and hands, especially the big toe. Uric acid salts
crystallize in the joint, and produce swelling, redness, and a sensation of heat and extreme pain.
Unlike most forms of arthritis, gout affects men in 90% of the cases. It generally does not begin until
after 35 years of age; peak age of onset is 45. Women who have it are generally post-menopausal."
disease-musculoskeletal-temporomandibular-joint-syndrome,Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Hot and cold (or hot or cold) packs will help relieve pain in the neck and shoulders.
• A diet rich in the B complex is important. Also calcium, magnesium, silicon, zinc,
lecithin, and flaxseed oil.
• Avoid sugar foods, which deplete calcium and other minerals.
• Avoid smoking and do not eat meat.
• Learn to relax and avoid stressful thinking or situations.
• If you sit a lot, relax and maintain good posture. Do not hunch over and strain.
• Do not sleep on your side or lie on your side with your head turned to the side.
• Do not prop your head at an angle (especially in bed) when reading, talking, or watching
television.
• Do not chew bits of food when the meal is over. Do not chew gum.
• Fast once a month, to give the body and jaws a rest so rebuilding can take place.
• Orthodontists, dentists, physical therapists, and other specialists offer treatments for
TMJ. But it is estimated that 90% of all cases respond well to simple, inexpensive,
treatments.
• Rheumatoid arthritis (which see) can also cause jaw pain.

Section 10
Muscular-Skeletal
Part 3
Tendons

(TMJ)
SYMPTOMS—Pain in the muscles and joints of the jaws, which can radiate to the face and neck. There
is a frequent clenching of the jaws.
Possible headache, toothaches, dizziness, pain and ringing in the ears, and pressure behind the eyes
When eating or yawning, there is a clicking, grinding, and popping noise, and perhaps pain. There may
be difficulty in opening and closing the jaws.
CAUSES—The bite is misaligned, either as a cause of the jaw problem or as an effect. The cartilage
disk that cushions the joint becomes damaged. This causes the bones of the temporomandibular joint to
rub against one another instead of gliding smoothly past each other. If the tooth repair or replacements
have not been done properly, this can be a factor in causing the problem.
Stress, a poor bite, and bruxism are the most frequent causes. Some people develop the habit of
clenching their teeth together during the day and/or at night. Called bruxism (which see), this is very
hard on the joint in the jaw.
An injury, poor dental work, osteoarthritis, bad posture, repeated or hard blows to the jaw or chin,
whiplash, gum chewing, thumb sucking, chewing on only one side of the mouth, or holding the phone
between the shoulder and jaw."
disease-musculoskeletal-muscle-cramps,Muscle Cramps,"(Muscle Pain, Leg Cramps; Charley Horse)
SYMPTOMS—A pain in a body muscle, most often in the legs (especially the calf muscles) or feet.
CAUSES—Muscle cramps may occur at any age. Between the ages of 15 to 80, a full 50% of people
will, at some time, have pain or cramps in the legs. Leg pains in children are frequent enough that they
are called ""growing pains.""
Reduced blood supply to the legs is part of the problem. Another is an imbalance in the levels of calcium
and magnesium in the body or a deficiency of vitamin E.
But other causes have also been noted: arthritis, anemia, tobacco usage, inactivity, poor circulation, too
much or too little exercise, muscle injury, allergy, fibromyalgia, arteriosclerosis, dehydration,
hypothyroidism, heat stroke, and varicose veins. Diuretic drugs for heart problems, or hypertension can
also induce cramps. Those who have had part of the stomach removed tend to have muscle cramps
thereafter.
If cramping occurs when walking and stops when you cease, it may be impaired circulation and nothing
more.
If leg cramps occur during pregnancy, they may be caused by hormone changes, fatigue, uterine
pressure, chilling, or muscle tenseness.
A calcium deficiency can make the leg muscles trigger-happy; the contractions in the muscles are
stronger.
Leg cramps in older people may be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the circulatory system. Turn to
the articles on heart and blood vessels, and see your physician. Vitamin E (600-800 IU daily) is very
helpful.
IMMEDIATE TREATMENT—
• Massage the muscles and use heat to relieve pain.
• A heating pad may be applied to the area. For some, alternate hot and cold compresses
work better (heat for 6 minutes and cold for 30 seconds, with 4 changes).
• Drink peppermint tea and apply it as an external compress.
• Pinch the upper lip between the thumb and index finger, and hold for 20-30 seconds till
the cramping disappears.
• If you are pregnant and cramping occurs, push the toes upward while applying pressure
to the knee, to flatten the affected part.
• Here is the strangest advice of all: The next day, repeat the activity that made you sore.
Do it with much less intensity. This will help work out the soreness. Thereafter, follow
this hard/easy routine; for it takes 48 hours for the muscle to properly recover. This is how
serious athletes train.
• An alternate method is to vary activities, such as regular walking, with occasional biking
or swimming instead.
• After hard exercise or physical work, slow down instead of stopping suddenly. The
bloodstream is loaded with lactic acid; so slowly exercise at a relaxed pace while it drains
off. (However, that will not protect you from soreness the next day, resulting from torn
muscle fiber.)
• Perhaps you need to change into more comfortable shoes, in order to improve your leg
and foot problems.
ONGOING CARE—The blood circulation needs to be improved and equalized.
Drink enough water each day.
A common mistake is to drink water and take salt tablets during heated exercise. Instead, you need a full
range of electrolytes, and not so much sodium chloride. Drink fruit drinks. At mealtime, eat lots of fresh
fruits and vegetables. Include seaweed in your diet. Potassium broth (from thick white potato peelings)
is excellent.
A fat-free, sugar-free, salt-free diet improves the circulation.
Eat an abundance of green leafy vegetables, in order to improve the quality of the blood and the mineral
balance.
Alfalfa, brewer's yeast, and kelp are important.
A deficiency of calcium, potassium, selenium, and vitamin E exists.
Mineral imbalances can produce cramping. Be sure you are getting enough calcium through
supplementation. Otherwise the phosphorous in certain foods locks with it, so the calcium cannot be
absorbed. See ""Bones, Strengthening"" for more information on solving the calcium-phosphorous
problem.
Those with dentures, who find eating vegetables difficult, are especially prone to magnesium and
calcium deficiency and leg cramps. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw
vegetable juices daily.
Every 3 hours, drink a large glass of quality water, to help clean the bloodstream, liver, kidneys, and
bowels of stored toxins.
Drink less whole milk
Eat your meals slowly and chew well.
Do not smoke. Nicotine greatly impedes blood circulation. Avoid second-hand smoke.
If you are taking diuretic drugs, take supplemental potassium. Better yet, switch to corn-silk tea and
other herbal diuretics; also drink more water (see the several articles on kidneys and urine).
Do not stand in one position for hours without moving. Some motion or shifting of body weight is vital.
Get off your feet for 5 minutes every hour. If possible, during that time, take your shoes off; massage
your feet and wiggle your toes.
Do not sit with crossed legs.
Stretch your legs every so often, with the feet flexed up, not down.
When sitting, try to elevate your feet every so often.
Do not wear garters or any binding clothes.
At night, wear roomy pajamas.
Keep the bed covers loose or use a foot cradle, to keep bedding weight off the feet. If you sleep on your
stomach, extend your feet over the edge of the bed. Another method is to sleep on your side, with your
legs bent and a pillow between your knees.
Rub olive or flaxseed oil into your muscles before and after strenuous exercise.
Twice a day, soak in a tub of warm water (100o-110o F.). Massage the toes, feet, and calves.
Here is an exercise which really helps stop ongoing lower leg cramps for many people: Stand with shoes
off, facing a wall 2-3 feet away. Lean forward, bracing against the wall with hands and arms, all the
while keeping your heels on the floor. When a moderate pull is felt in the calves, hold that position for
10 seconds.
Then stand straight for 5 seconds of rest, and lean forward and repeat. Do 3 stretching cycles.
If you are overweight, reduce to normal range or slightly below.
If leg cramps are caused by varicose veins or pregnancy, elevate the foot of the bed 9 inches.
If leg cramping occurs during pregnancy, take frequent rest periods with the feet elevated. Wear
comfortable, not tight, clothing. Be sure you are getting enough calcium; this is important.
—Also see ""Claudication,"" which has the same leg symptoms—but some very special, dangerous
causes. It also has additional information on improving the circulation of the legs.
ENCOURAGEMENT—In His service, God will place upon you no restriction that will not increase
your happiness. In complying with His requirements, you will find a peace, contentment, and joy you
can never have in the path of sin."
disease-musculoskeletal-muscle-injuries,Muscle Injuries,"TREATMENT
• According to one view, sprains should be treated with ice or very cold water. Follow this
by bandaging the injury with an Ace bandage.
• But, according to a different view, sprains should be initially treated with alternate hot
and cold—especially if it is in the wrist, elbow, or ankle. This method works better than
using cold alone!
• Put the injured part in very hot water, and keep it there 20-30 minutes. Every few
minutes take it out of the hot water and plunge it into cold water for about a minutes, then
back into the hot. Keep the hot water hot. This can continue for up to 2 hours with good
results.
• Repeat this for several days; and, twice a day, massage around the area.
• If you use the cold method alone on a sprain, you may not be able to walk on a sprained
ankle for days; use the alternate hot and cold method, and you may be much better in half
the time.
• (A third method calls for cold on strains to begin with, to reduce initial swelling,
followed by alternate hot and cold afterward.)
• If the sprain or strain is in the back or shoulder, treat it with hot fomentations, short cold,
and massage.
• A bad bruise on any part of the body can be treated as for a sprain or strain.
• In addition to the above, strains frequently require a cast similar to that used for a
fracture, so the injured joint area can be immobilized for more complete rest.
• DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is a liquid that can be applied externally to the injured area,
to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and promote healing. But only buy it in the health food
store.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Those who put away iniquity from their hearts and stretch out their hands in
earnest supplication unto God will have that help which God alone can give them. In His strength, you
can fulfill His will for your life.
# ATHLETIC WORKOUTS (Strengthening the Muscles)
PREPARATION—Here are a few helpful suggestions for those engaged in ongoing athletic workouts
or other heavy labor or activity:
Maintain a nutritious diet, including full vitamin/mineral supplementation. Eat salads, whole grains,
seaweed, seeds, nuts, and drink vegetable juices.
Maintain strong bones (see ""Bones, Strengthening""). Include silica (horsetail and oat straw herbs), to
help calcium strengthen the bones.
Vitamins A, D, E, C, zinc, and manganese are needed.
At the meal before a workout, do not eat much roughage, requiring energy to digest; it will make you
sluggish. At that meal, avoid peaches, grapes, bananas, and celery.
Locate your allergies and eliminate them. If you have food allergies, exercise may increase the
absorption of the allergenic food, resulting in severe reactions. See ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test.""
Glucose is the main fuel for the muscles. It is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen.
You can only work as long as you have stored glycogen ready to be changed into glucose. The best way
to store up this glycogen is to eat complex carbohydrates.
Although body fat can also be converted to energy, avoid eating much fat. Focus on getting
carbohydrates, not fat, in your diet.
Proteins are needed for muscles and tissues; they are not an energy source. The need for protein does not
increase during a workout. Excess protein intake (at any time) increases urine elimination, which
produces dehydration unless you are drinking enough water. Eating too much protein can damage the
kidneys.
Stretch and warm up your muscles before exercising. Before doing this, muscles are about 98o F. and
stiff. After a 5 minutes warm-up, they are several degrees higher and ready for action.
Drink fluids before, during, and after workouts. To prevent dehydration and cramping, do this whether
or not you are thirsty.
Be sure and obtain adequate electrolytes. A 50-50 mix of fruit juice and water will help supply this.
After a workout, keep moving until you are rested. Do not take a shower until your body temperature
has cooled down. This cooling down wait will help you avoid cramping and even a heart attack.
Do not use steroids in order to increase muscle mass and athletic performance! You may see temporary
gain, but you are injuring your body.
In men, Dr. Graham Reedy, M.D, says that long-term use can lead to cancer, sterility, breast
enlargement, shrinkage of the testicles, and osteoporosis (hollowing of the bones, leading to breakage).
After mentioning some of the diseases steroid usage can lead to, Graham Reedy, M.D., adds: ""Once the
steroid treatments are stopped, all the buildup is lost, and fat tends to infiltrate the
tissue."" (Complementary Medicine/Sports Review, March/April 1986, p. 33.)
In women, excess facial and body hair, breast cancer, shrinkage of the breasts may occur.
Steroids tend to be psychologically addictive. The person feels dependent on taking them, until the
physical damage becomes deeply ingrained. Anabolic steroids can produce heart attacks.
Do not lift weights if you have a heart problem. At the moment of the lift, breathing stops, circulation to
the heart decreases, and great pressure is placed on the heart and lungs by surrounding muscles.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Real happiness is found only in being good and doing good. Live to bless
others, and you will find your deepest satisfaction. Live only for yourself, and you will perish alone.

# POSTURE, IMPROVING
SYMPTOMS—A round-shouldered appearance.
It is easy, over the years, to let your posture collapse. Here are several suggestions to get it back into
shape:
• Relax and practice standing up straight. Put your back and head against a wall as you
look forward. Hold it for a minute and get a feel for what the ideal is like.
• Recognize that, as you go through the day, you will not always maintain this ideal. But it
gives you something to work toward.
• The best place to practice good posture is when you are walking outside. Try to walk
erect. Notice that doing so makes it easier to take full breaths of air, and you feel better.
• Then, when it is time to work, relax, and work, do not worry about keeping a ramrod
back when you are stooping over, writing, washing the dishes, etc. Real living is not
ramrod; it is a variety of positions.
• But, when you take your outdoor exercise, return closer to that ideal of perfect posture.
Here are more ideas:
• Lie on the floor with your chin down and head straight forward.
• When you stand, keep both feet flat on the floor. Resting on one leg leads to curvature of
the back.
• Adjust your chair height, so that your thighs are be parallel with the floor and your knees
are level with, or slightly higher than, your hips. If not, they pull your body forward; your
back slumps; and you work harder, trying keep your back upright.
• If you place a small pillow between the small of your back (the lumbar area) and the
back of the chair, you will tend to sit straighter.
• As you are sitting, you ought to be able to feel the bones in your buttocks against the
seat. If you cannot do so, wiggle around until you can. When you cannot feel them, you
are slumping.
• When seated at a table and not working, sit 6-8 inches away from it. This will keep you
from slumping over onto it. Only your wrists will be on the edge of the table before you.
Maintain this same distance if you are working on a computer or typewriter.
Television news announcers use the following two methods, to make a better appearance when they talk
while being seated:
• (1) Tend to sit on the edge of your chair; you will be less likely to slump back into it.
• (2) While sitting on the edge of your chair, curl one foot under the chair and stretch the
other out for balance. This will help keep your back straight.
• Do not cross your legs. Doing so throws your body out of alignment. Keep your feet flat
on the floor.
• In a car, pull the seat toward the pedals, until your knees are bent and slightly higher
than your hips, and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Either place a small cushion
behind the small of your back or use the seat adjustment available in some cars.
• Get enough sleep at night. You cannot stand or sit straight if you are exhausted.
• Sleep on a firm mattress. When you lie on your side, both hips and shoulders should sink
in just a little.
• When sleeping, either sleep on the side, with a pillow under your head, thick enough to
keep your head untilted, or sleep on your back, with only a thin pillow under your head
and possibly a small pillow under your knees.
• Walk, run, cycle, or do exercises and stretching, to keep your muscles stretched and in
good condition.
• Here is a way to rest your back and improve your posture at the same time, either during
break or at the end of the day: Lie on the floor for a few minutes with your legs on a low
chair or stool.
ENCOURAGEMENT—A ransom has been paid for the souls of men, but we must individually
surrender our lives to God, so that we may claim that ransom. God has a heaven full of blessings for
you.

(Sprains and Strains)
SYMPTOMS—Bruised wrists, ankles, fingers, knees, back, hips, and sore or swollen muscles.
CAUSES—Muscle injuries can occur when straining muscles too much, using them too long or hard,
suddenly twisting, or hard falls.
Athletes frequently have such problems.
Sprains are a painful stretching of ligaments of the joints, caused by lifting, sudden stops or turns,
injuries, or falls.
Strains are more severe; They involve torn ligaments and torn joint capsule, with bleeding and swelling.
The following suggestions are good both for prevention and treatment of injuries:"
disease-musculoskeletal-backache,Backache,"TREATMENT
First, we will consider less serious back pain:
• The most common cause of backache is muscle strain. Rest will generally eliminate the
problem. Bed rest for 24 hours may be needed.
• Soaking in a tub of warm water may be quite relaxing to a strained back.
• For the first 72 hours after a back strain occurs, an 8-minute ice massage often helps.
Use ice cubes (or freeze water in a paper cup or frozen fruit- juice can). Massage the area
and about 6-8 inches around it.
• After 72 hours, use alternate hot and cold applications. Apply a wrung-out hot towel for
30 seconds, followed by brief cold. Do this 4-5 times.
• Ice packs are especially helpful in relieving muscles spasms.
• Moist heat reduces local inflammation and increases blood flow to the area.
• Some people think that staying in bed for a week will help back pain. This is not true. If
you remain in bed a week, it will take two weeks to rehabilitate.
• Stretching a sore back will tend to accelerate the healing process. Gently bring your
knees up from the bed and to your chest. Once there, put a little pressure on your knees.
Stretch, then relax. Do this again.
Preventive measures that will help you, either before or after experiencing back problems:
• Be very careful when lifting something. Take several deep breaths, to increase muscle
strength and then slowly lift with the legs, not the back, and hold the object close to your
body. Do not lift from a bending forward position (closing windows, lifting things from
deep in the car trunk).
• Keep the body warm and do not become overly fatigued. When the muscles are chilled
or you are exhausted, it is easier to injure joints because the muscles are not able to do the
work needed.
• Do not take a hot bath just before doing heavy exercise, for your muscles will be in a
weaker condition.
• Proper nutrition, including adequate amounts of calcium, minerals, vitamin D, etc. See
""Bones, Strengthening"" for much more on this.
Exercises, to build the muscles are very important, if you would avoid back trouble. More on this later in
this article.
• Walking and rowing are good for the back (walking is good for just about everything!).
• When sleeping, either a firm mattress should be used or a ¾-inch thick ply board should
be placed beneath the top mattress. Place 1-2 pillows under the knees to straighten the
lumbar curve. When lying on the side, flex the knees and place a pillow between them.
• Avoid sleeping on the stomach; it increases the swayback and twists the neck. This is
due to the fact that the trunk, being heavier, sinks farther into the bed, causing the back to
arch.
• It is reported that water beds, which do not make a lot of waves, may help people with
back trouble to sleep.
• When you get out of bed, roll out slowly and carefully. Do not sit straight up in bed.
• If you have back pain, slide to the edge of the bed. Then, keeping your back rigid, let
your legs off the bed first. That will act as a springboard, lifting your upper body up and
off the bed.
• Sit in a straight chair with a firm back. The knees should be higher than the hips; if
necessary, use a small footstool. Avoid soft sofas and stuffed chairs. Chair arms help
support the shoulders and upper back. Get up and move about every so often.
• When in a car, push the car seat forward, to raise the knees higher than the hips. This
lessens back and shoulder strain. Use safety belts.
• Look for a car with adjustable lumbar support, and adjust the support down as low as it
goes. Then, if necessary, raise it a notch or two.
• Do not stand in one position for long periods.
• High-heeled shoes will bring trouble sooner or later. Women should wear low-heeled
shoes if they want to protect their pelvic organs and spine.
• Good posture when sitting, standing, or walking should be the goal.
Exercises to strengthen the back:
• Do press-ups which are half a push-up. Lie on the floor, on your stomach. Keep your
pelvis flat on the floor and push up with your hands, arching your back as you lift your
shoulders off the floor. This will help strengthen your lower back.
• Do floor swimming. Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise your left arm and right leg.
Hold for one second, then alternate with the right arm and left leg. Go back and forth. This
extends and strengthens the lower back.
• Do a crunch sit-up. Lay on your back on the floor, with knees flexed and feet flat on the
floor. Cross your arms with your hands on your shoulders. Raise your head and shoulders
off the floor as high as you can while keeping your lower back on the floor. Hold for one
second, then repeat.
• Know your limit when exercising. If you feel fine 1-2 days after exercising, then it is
safe to continue them.
• Spinal surgery: Should you have a back operation? Sometimes the problem is so serious
that a back operation is necessary. But, if at all possible, try to avoid having one. Not only
are they expensive, but frequently do not solve your movement and pain problems. It is an
intriguing fact that, according to U.S. government reports, only 1% of those with back
pain obtains relief from back surgery. And there is always the possibility that the
operation will only result in greater pain, more serious damage, and even less mobility.
But, after weighing all the possibilities, you may still decide to undergo it.
—Also see ""Sciatica.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Those who come frequently to the throne of grace, offering up sincere,
earnest, prayers for God's help will not fail of fulfilling His plan for their lives.
SCOLIOSIS—1
(Curvature of the Spine)
SYMPTOMS—The spine is curved slightly to one side.
CAUSES—Scoliosis occurs 80% of the time in girls, and primarily in preteen and teen years, during
rapid growth spurts.
Diagnosis is made by having the person bend over away from you. Look for lateral deviation (a leaning
to the left or right).
The primary cause is that one set of the spinal muscles (right side or left side) is stronger than the other.
This causes an ""S"" curve in the spine.
These changes are the result of degeneration of muscles on one side; and, in some instances, they may
be the early stage of muscular dystrophy.
• In the early stages, scoliosis can be eliminated. But the person must be faithful in taking
mineral and vitamin supplements. Failure to do so can result in serious damage, back
braces, and surgery.
• Avoid food allergies, eat a nourishing diet; drop all junk foods, caffeine, alcohol, soft
drinks, etc.
• Each day take vitamin E (800-1,200 IU), selenium (500-1,000 mcg), calcium (2,000
mg), and magnesium (1,000 mg).
—See ""Scoliosis—2.""(next article) Also see ""Bones, Strengthening"" for much more information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—No sin is small in God's sight; but, in His strength, we can resist all temptation
to leave His side and run after the trinkets Satan offers us. Cling to Jesus and, in spite of the
disappointments of earth, you will have peace of heart.
SCOLIOSIS—2
(Curvature of the Spine; Posterior-Lateral Scoliosis) (J.H.
Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
TO IMPROVE GENERAL NUTRITION AND BLOOD MOVEMENT—Graduated Tonic Friction
baths; massage, carefully administered; nutritious aseptic dietary; sweating baths, especially the Radiant
Heat Bath followed by Cold Mitten Friction, carefully given; copious water drinking.
TO COMBAT LOCAL MORBID PROCESSES—Fomentation to the back twice daily, followed by
Heating Compress to spine. The Heating Compress may be applied at night and retained until morning.
Hot Leg Bath with Fomentation to the spine; prolonged Neutral Bath, 1-4 hours daily.
TO RELIEVE COLONIC SPASM AND NERVOUS IRRITABILITY—Warm Bath at 960-1000 F.;
prolonged Neutral Pail Pour to the spine at 930-980 F., with Heating Compress at night; Rest in bed
when symptoms are progressing.
FOR MUSCULAR WEAKNESS OR PARALYSIS—Massage, exercise of muscles, special
gymnastics.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid the Cold Douche and other general Cold Baths, prolonged Hot
Baths, exercise to the extent of fatigue.

Abdominal
PERITONITIS—1
SYMPTOMS—Severe abdominal pain and tenderness, rigidity of the abdominal muscles, fever, rapid
pulse, sunken eyes, vomiting, and a pinched expression of the face.
CAUSES—Peritonitis is serious and frequently fatal. Take the person to the hospital.
It is caused by blows, stab wounds, gunshot wounds, complication of a surgical operation, appendicitis,
childbirth, or ovarian disease.
Less common is chronic peritonitis, also called tuberculosis peritonitis. This is tubercular in origin, and
shows little pain or fever and few symptoms other than great emaciation, loss of strength, and fluid in
the abdominal cavity.
• Use warm, whole, baths or warm, wet, packs over the abdomen. A castor oil pack is also
good.
• If there is pain, take a slippery elm retention enema every morning.
• Go on a 3-day carrot juice fast or a diet of oatmeal gruels, lentil and barley soup, and
other potassium fruits and vegetables.
• During the inflammatory stage, avoid eating. Instead, drink as much slippery elm tea as
possible, sipping it continually.
• Helpful herb teas include bryonia, pleurisy root, and aconite.
• Once past the critical stage, drink comfrey root tea every 3-4 hours, along with echinacea
tablets.
• If the condition is tuberculosis peritonitis, the patient should be treated as for
tuberculosis (which see).
—Also see ""Peritonitis—2,"" ""Appendicitis,"" and ""Tuberculosis.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus cares for each one, as though there were not another in the whole world.
You can trust your case with Him. He will not fail you. Your only danger is in leaving His side, to
follow after the luring temptations Satan offers you.
PERITONITIS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
PERITONITIS (ACUTE) —
DIETETIC FACTORS—Rest in bed, fluid diet, fruit juice without sugar, gruels of dextrinized or
malted cereals, withhold food for 24-48 hours.
ALBUMIN IN URINE—Hot Blanket Pack and other sweating measures to maintain cutaneous activity,
repeated every 2-4 hours.
FEVER—Hot Blanket Pack, followed by Cold Mitten Friction; prolonged Neutral Bath, Fomentation to
abdomen with Cooling Wet Sheet Pack at the same time.
GENERAL ASPECTS—Enema at 800 F., repeating, to remove gas. Fomentation every 2 hours for 15-
20 minutes. During interval between, apply Heating Compress at 600 F., changing every 5 minutes while
the body temperature is elevated, less frequently as temperature falls. Copious water drinking; prolonged
Neutral bath; cold Compress or Ice Bag over heart for 15 minutes, 2-3 times a day, for cardiac weakness.
PREVENT OBSTRUCTION—Large enema 3 times a day from beginning, temperature 750 F.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Same as Chronic form, just below.
PERITONITIS (CHRONIC) —
GENERAL ASPECTS—Aseptic dietary, liquid diet. Hot Enema followed by Fomentation to abdomen
for 20 minutes, 3 times daily; well-protected Heating Compress during the interval between. Copious
water drinking; graduated cold applications (Tonic Frictions), twice daily. If temperature is elevated,
Neutral Bath half an hour to an hour daily.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid Cold Full Baths, Prolonged Cold Douche, Cold Pail Pour, Cold
Wet Sheet Rub, and Cold Sitz.
PERITONITIS (PELVIC), CELLULITIS —
BASIC CONSIDERATIONS—Surgical and puerperal asepsis, care to avoid exposures at menstrual
periods, protection of feet and legs in damp and cold weather, proper clothing.
INCREASE RESISTANCE—Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub 2-4 times a day, protecting
pelvic viscera by simultaneous Hot Foot Pack or Hot Foot and Leg Pack or by hot water bottle to sacrum
and Cold Compress over stomach area.
COMBAT LOCAL INFLAMMATION—Hot Hip and Leg Pack 20 minutes every 2 hours; during
intervals between, Cold Compress at 600 F. to area over stomach, pudenda and inner surfaces of thighs,
with heat to feet and legs or ice bag over seat of pain; hot water bottles or Fomentations to feet, hips and
thighs; hot and cold pelvic compress with ice bag over seat of pain, continue 20-40 minutes and repeat
when needed; hot vaginal irrigation at 1100-1200 F., one gallon, every 4 hours.
ENCOURAGE RESOLUTION—After the acute stage has passed, apply Alternate Compress for 30
minutes, 3 times a day; during interval, Heating Compresses, changing every 2 hours or as soon as well-
warmed; Graduated Baths for tonic purposes; alternate vaginal irrigation (1100, 800 to 700 F.); later,
pelvic massage.
PAIN—Fomentation or Revulsive Compress every 2-4 hours or oftener, if necessary.
CONSTIPATION—Large Hot Enemas, twice a day, during acute pain and inflammation; later,
graduated Cold Enema.
CHILL—Anticipate chill by wrapping her in warm blankets with hot bags to trunk and limbs; hot water
drinking.
SEPTlC FEVER—Add to local measures, if fever is high, Hot Blanket Pack 10-15 minutes, followed
by sweating Wet Sheet Pack, Prolonged Neutral Bath. If suppuration (pussing) occurs, surgical
interference is generally indicated.
CAUTIONS—Avoid Cold Baths; instead use partial cold applications, such as the Cold Mitten Friction
and the Cold Towel Rub.
—Also see ""Peritonitis—1.""

(Low Back Pain; Sciatica; Slipped Disk; Lumbar Disk
Herniation; Spinal Disk Prolapse)
SYMPTOMS—Pain in the back, frequently in the lower back.
If pain comes after lifting something heavy, after coughing, or after unusually heavy exercise, and the
pain prevents you from moving or shoots down one leg, you may have a herniated disk.
CAUSES—Backache, or pain felt in the spinal column, is one of the most common reasons for
hospitalization in the Western world. Your spinal column has a complicated interconnection of muscles,
tendons, bones, and ligaments.
It is helpful to identify the various parts of the spine, also called the vertebrae (singular is vertebra): The
top part of the spine, where the neck is located, is called the cervical spine (or cervicals); the shoulder
and mid-part (which protrudes outward in an adult) is called the thoracic; the lower portion (called the
hollow of the back) is the lumbar; and the bottom part (ending in the tailbone or coccyx) is the sacrum.
The first cervical is the atlas. This enables your head to tilt up or down. The second is the axis; it permits
your head to turn from side to side.
Aches and pains in the lower back can be a chronic problem. This pain can be in the spine or it can be in
the sacroiliac. The sacroiliac joint connects (articulates is the correct word) the spine to the pelvic bone.
(There can also be pain in the muscles of the lower back; it is called lumbago.)
A subluxation occurs when two vertebrae get out of proper alignment with one another. A chiropractor
puts these back in place for relatively little cost.
Sciatica is chronic pain in the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve, which
passes down through the upper leg, can experience neuralgia and neuritis as a result of a pinched nerve
in the lumbar region. If the problem is not solved, eventually the leg where the pain is may no longer
receive nerve signals from the brain or the central nervous system.
The intervertebral disks (also spelled discs) are made of cartilage and act as cushions between the
vertebrae. Each disk has a tough, fibrous, outer layer surrounding a soft interior, which provides the
cushioning.
Lumbar disk herniation and lumbar disk prolapse occur when the disk herniates (ruptures or breaks) and
some of this soft inner disk material pushes outward against the spinal cord to one degree or another.
This may be very serious; and, like sciatica, it can lead to muscle wasting, reduced nerve reflexes, and
muscle weakness. Disk herniation and prolapse are often erroneously referred to as a ""slipped disk.""
Causes of lower-back pain include wrenched or damaged muscles, bones, tendons, or ligaments, Kidney
or bladder infection, prostate problems, or female pelvic disorders may cause backache. Overeating,
overdrinking, eating the wrong kinds of food, and constipation can also be involved. The spinal bones,
and muscles attached to them, are weakened by wrong habits. Chronic conditions causing back pain
include arthritis, bone disease, or abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis).
Other causes of back pain are poor posture, walking habits, improper shoes, lifting, straining, calcium
deficiency, slouching when sitting, or soft mattresses.
There is a definite relationship between smoker's cough and severe back pain. Injecting the nicotine
equivalent of one cigarette decidedly reduced the measured blood flow in the vertebral body. It is also
thought that using tobacco interferes with the elasticity of connective tissue.
A small percentage of lower-back pain may be linked to flat feet.
Sometimes a serious case of constipation will cause an ache in the back, from impacted stools or
pressure from gas.
(More rarely, back pain can result from congenital abnormalities, metabolic disorders, cancer, or
referred syndromes.)
The back pain can also be the result of an excess of lactic acid in the muscles, following muscular
exercise. Drinking enough water helps lessen this problem.
Where can you go to get help with your bad back? There are lots of experts out there:
Chiropractors adjust the back by pushing and thrusting. They also recommend nutritional and lifestyle
changes. In 1994, the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research issued a report, that
chiropractors generally provided the most effective treatments for acute back pain. They cost far less, do
the job quicker, and do not give medicinal drugs (most of which are usually poisonous). The British
Medical Journal reported that chiropractic treatments proved more successful than hospital treatments in
nearly every way.
X rays are generally considered a routine part of back pain diagnosis; yet only a few back conditions
show up on x rays! If the pain is caused by muscle strain or a herniated disk, an x ray will not reveal
anything because muscles, disks, and ligaments are all soft tissues. Beware of x rays if you are pregnant.
Orthopedic surgeons are another source of help. These are medical doctors who also do back surgery,
they are very likely to recommend it—and that is something you want to avoid, if at all possible.
Osteopaths can prescribe drugs and do surgery also, but they are less likely to do so.
Physiatrists, also called doctors of physical medicine, are also medical doctors. They have a good record
of helping to solve serious back problems (such as disk problems) without resorting to surgery (which
they are not licensed to do). They recommend lifestyle changes, back braces, etc.
Physical therapists try to restore muscle strength and joint and spine mobility.
Which back pains are the most serious?
Back pain that comes on suddenly, for no apparent reason.
Back pain that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, stomach cramps, chest pain, or
difficult breathing.
An acute attack of back pain that lasts more than 2-3 days, without any relief.
Chronic pain which lasts more than 2 weeks.
Pain in the back which radiates down the leg to the knee or foot."
disease-musculoskeletal-rheumatic-fever,Rheumatic Fever,"TREATMENT
• Give a nourishing diet, restricting all salt. Put on a water and fresh fruit and vegetable
juice diet. Eat no solid food until the fever subsides and joint pain is reduced. Then
maintain a light diet, including fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, etc.
• Avoid caffeine, fried foods, soft drinks, processed or refined foods, sugar, or salt.
• Bioflavonoids are especially valuable in preventing and treating rheumatic fever.
• Bed rest is very important.
• While in bed, massage and mild exercise is helpful. A planned exercise program should
be undertaken later.
• Useful herbs include bayberry bark, goldenseal, yellow dock, pau d'arco, and burdock
root. Echinacea and dandelion are also good.
ENCOURAGEMENT—To many, as to Mary, Christ says, ""Why weepest Thou? Whom seekest thou?""
He is close beside us, but so often our tear-blinded eyes do not discern Him. Pray earnestly for help, and
you will feel Him near.

SYMPTOMS—Pain, inflammation, and stiffness in a large joint, such as the knee. These initial
symptoms are accompanied by pain.
The pain and swelling can travel from one joint to another. A skin rash may also appear.
CAUSES—Rheumatic fever is a streptococcal disease (Streptococcus Group A), and occurs between the
ages of 4 and 18. It tends to follow a bout with tonsillitis, scarlet fever, strep throat, or an ear infection;
most often strep throat (see ""Tonsillitis"")
After the disease appears ended, it may recur again later.
Rheumatic fever affects one or several body organs or locations: joints (arthritis), brain (chorea), tissues
(nodules), skin (erythema marginatum), or heart (carius). It may also result in residual heart disease,
producing permanent damage to one or more heart valves. (See ""Arthritis"" and ""Chorea."")
The residual heart valve damage is the most dangerous aspect of untreated rheumatic fever. Treatment
early in the course of the disease will generally prevent the heart damage. But this treatment may require
the help of a physician and a stay in the hospital. Here is supplementary information:"
disease-reproductive-breast-discomfort,Breast Discomfort,"TREATMENT
• For breast tenderness, apply vitamin E on the area, and be sure to include enough
essential fatty acids in the diet (5 gm, 3 times a day). Flaxseed oil, sunflower seed oil, or
wheat germ oil are best.
• Selenium is an antioxidant and helps prevent breast tenderness.
• Using caffeine products is linked to breast tenderness.
• Discomfort and soreness in the breast is also a symptom of fibrocystic breast disease (see
""Breast Cyst).""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Since Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is acquainted with our
trials and sympathizes with our griefs. Obey God's Ten Commandment law, by faith in Jesus Christ, and
you will have a much happier life.

(Breast Tenderness)
SYMPTOMS—There is tenderness and discomfort in the breast.
CAUSES—Breast tenderness is a common characteristic of the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and early
pregnancy. If caused by PMS, the tenderness may occur regularly every month; if associated with early
pregnancy, missed periods and a positive home pregnancy test will reveal that.
The cause is generally the natural cycles of your reproductive hormones, which are estrogen and
progesterone. They signal the milk-producing glands in the breast to grow and areas around them to
expand with blood and other fluids to nourish the cells. This can result in stretched nerve fibers and a
sense of pain.
Then there are fibrocystic changes, which include lumps and cysts (see ""Breast Cyst"" for more
information)."
disease-reproductive-breast-inflammation,Breast Inflammation,"TREATMENT
• Soak a cloth in a mixture of 1 pint of linseed oil and 4 ounces of spirits of camphor, and
cover the entire affected area. Apply as often as needed.
• Hot and cold applications of dry cloths help relieve the soreness and inflammation. Give
these continually until relieved. Then apply the mixture again.
• When the breast is swollen, give a poultice slippery elm, with a little lobelia added to it.
• Drink a tea of goldenseal, black cohosh, and ginger.
• Go on a short fruit and vegetable juice fast, and clean out the bowels.

ENCOURAGEMENT—As the Son of man, Christ gives an example of obedience to God's holy law;
as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey that law.

SYMPTOMS—Painful and hard swelling in the breast. There is restlessness, throbbing, burning pain,
and possible fever.
CAUSES—Injury or improper diet are among the causes of inflamed, swollen, caked breasts, or sore
nipples."
disease-reproductive-breast-cyst,Breast Cyst,"TREATMENT
• Eat a low-fat, high-fiber diet, including more raw foods. Emphasize fruits, vegetables,
and whole grains. Do not eat nuts which have been heated.
• The trace element, germanium, is important. It is found in garlic and onions.
• Research shows that milk and dairy products have high estrogen levels. It is best to avoid
them, for the cyst problem can always lead to a cancerous condition.
• Avoid a diet high in meat, eggs, butter, and cheese.
• White-flour products should be avoided.
• Do not eat chocolate, animal products, cooked oils, fried foods, sugar, salt or drink
beverages with alcohol or caffeine.
• Do not use nicotine products. They stimulate the growth of cysts.
• Not using caffeine and applying primrose oil will help reduce the cysts.
• Methylxanthines (which include caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine), found in
caffeine and chocolate foods have, been found to induce breast disease.
• Keep the weight low. It is more difficult to locate tumors in larger breasts.
• If you have an underactive thyroid, do what is needed to strengthen it, since
hypothyroidism (which see) has been linked to fibrocystic disease.
• Breast congestion can be caused by padded bras. Do not overheat the breasts; this can
lead to breast cancer.
• Excess clothing on the trunk, and not enough on the extremities, is a significant cause of
female problems of various types.
• Drink enough water, so it is easier for the blood and lymphatic system to care for the
milk glands.
Here is additional advice, to help you avoid problems with benign breast changes:
• Regularly take B vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium. These vitamins help
regulate the production of prostaglandin E, which in turn slows down prolactin activity.
Prolactin activates breast tissue.
• Do not use diuretic drugs. Instead, drink more water to help improve kidney function.
• Do not use highly salted foods.
• Some find that applying cold water to the breasts helps when they are painful. But others
find that alternating very warm and cold works better. This can be done via heating pads,
cold cloths, showers, etc.
• Gentle breast massage will help move liquids out of the breast area into the lymph
passages.
• Dong quai helps regulate hormonal levels. Goldenseal helps heal infections. Red clover
cleans the blood. Chlorophyll helps clean the liver and prevent formation of cysts.
Germanium and CoQ10 provide oxygen to the cells and prevent free radical damage.
Flaxseed oil helps prevent breast cancer.

ENCOURAGEMENT—When you open your eyes in the morning, thank God that He has kept you
through the night. Thank Him for all His blessings. Live your days in the presence of God; and, by faith
in Christ, obey His Ten Commandment law.

Reproductive
Part 2
Menstrual Problems

(Fibrocystic Breast Disease; Cystic Mastitis)
SYMPTOMS—Discomfort, soreness, tenderness, lumpiness, and possible felt lumps and cysts in the
breast. These will be round lumps which move freely and are either firm or soft.
The symptoms are the most prominent before the monthly, and almost entirely absent during pregnancy.
CAUSES—This is the most common breast problem that women have; over 50% of adult females have
it. This is most frequent in women of child-bearing age, and primarily occurs between the ages of 30 and
50.
When there is too much fluid in the breast, instead of moving it out of the breast, the lymph system
stores it in small spaces, here and there. Eventually, fibrous tissue surrounds them and thickens, forming
cysts. These cysts frequently swell just before the monthly, causing pain.
These cysts may change in size; but, although tender, they move freely. In contrast, a cancerous growth
generally does not move freely, is usually not tender, and does not leave.
It is important to regularly examine each breast for lumps, and determine what kind they are. It is best to
do this weekly.
It is known that the risk of breast cancer is three times as great in women with cysts.
Breast cysts rarely appear after the age of 50, when estrogen levels are less.
Hormonal imbalance, abnormal production of breast milk (caused by high levels of estrogen), and an
underactive thyroid can induce cysts.
Other causative agents are listed below."
disease-reproductive-premenstrual-syndrome,Premenstrual Syndrome,"TREATMENT
• Constipation is a primary reason why the liver cannot get rid of excess estradiol. Eat
natural foods with sufficient bulk. Avoid processed and junk foods.
• Meals high in complex carbohydrates help one deal with stress. It is thought that they
increase the production of serotonin, a brain chemical which counteracts depression.
• An inadequate supply of B complex vitamins is another factor causing PMS. B vitamins
and magnesium help the liver excrete unwanted estrogen. Fried foods block the absorption
of magnesium.
• Eating chocolate, caffeine, sugar, and excess sodium are additional causative factors.
Women who regularly consume caffeine are four times more likely to have severe PMS.
• Red meat and dairy products help produce a hormonal imbalance—exactly the kind in
PMS, excessive estrogen and inadequate progesterone.
• Another factor is unstable blood sugar levels. This can be caused by hypoglycemia or
simply poor eating habits. Either way, eat complex carbohydrates and avoid the sugar
foods.
• Food allergies are another related factor. Search out the offending foods and stop eating
them (see ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test"").
• It is important that you not eat foods which contain hormones! Many have been added to
dairy products (via cows and chickens) and meat.
• Obtain a full supply of vitamin/mineral supplements.
• Adequate calcium intake during the monthly cycle is very important. Blood calcium
drops 10 days before menstruation. A lack of it causes headaches, tension, nervousness,
depression, insomnia.
• Magnesium and vitamin D help in calcium absorption. Adequate stomach acid is also
needed.
• Do not use caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.
• Fast for 1-3 days on fruit and vegetable juices before the period onset, to reduce
problems.
• Regular outdoor exercise is important. Walk at least half a mile a day. This increases
oxygen intake, which in turn aids in nutrient absorption and elimination of toxins.
• Here are herbs which may help reduce the pain of cramps: rosemary, black haw, cramp
bark, red raspberry, kava kava, and angelica.
• Selenium is an antioxidant and helps prevent menstrual cramps.
• Use warm sitz baths, heating pad, or hot water bottle for cramps. This draws the healing
blood and relaxes muscles.
• Herbs helpful in treating PMS include dong quai, false unicorn root, fennel seed, squaw
vine, blessed thistle, and sarsaparilla root. They help balance the hormones.
• Some women with PMS are deficient in melatonin.
• Wild yam cream contains a natural form of the hormone, progesterone, and helps many
women. Rub the cream into the skin on the chest, inner arms, thighs, and abdomen just
after ovulation. The active ingredient is absorbed through the skin.
• Vitamin E has been found useful in the treatment of PMS, with most improvement
where benign breast disease was a major problem. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and helps
prevent inflammatory reactions to dietary fats. It is possible that Vitamin A and zinc also
aids in this function.
• Vitamin B (50-150 mg daily, especially during the 10 days preceding menstruation,
6
helps relieve premenstrual edema, swellings, and soreness.
• Discuss the problem with your spouse. This will help him understand the situation.

ENCOURAGEMENT—The angels of God guard us every moment. Have we not reason to be thankful
for the protection we are given? All through the day, thank God for His blessings.

(PMS)
SYMPTOMS—There are over 150 symptoms linked to PMS, of which the most common include
abdominal bloating, anxiety, acne, backache, breast swelling and tenderness, swollen feet, depression,
cramps, food cravings, fainting spells, headaches, fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, nervousness, impatience,
drastic mood swings, angry outbursts.
Other symptoms include sluggishness, lethargy, delusions, indecisiveness, dizziness, constipation,
hemorrhoids, skin eruptions, and migraines.
CAUSES—PMS affects many women during the one to two weeks prior to the onset of menstruation. It
affects one-third to one-half of all American women between the ages of 20 and 50. As many as 75%
have the problem at one time or another. About 5% are incapacitated by it, and about a third report
symptoms severe enough to interfere with their daily life.
Bearing children or being married seems to increase the likelihood. The problem is a major cause of
divorce.
Hormonal imbalance is part of the PMS problem (see ""Menstrual Disorders"").
The liver regulates hormonal balance, by selectively filtering out of the blood and excreting unwanted
excess hormones. One of these is estradiol, a type of estrogen which causes problems. If not eliminated,
it can build up in the body.
Part of the hormonal imbalance problem is that there is too much estrogen in the body and not enough
progesterone. Fluid retention is the result. This affects the circulation and impedes oxygen and nutrient
flow to the brain and female organs.
Additional causative factors are mentioned below."
disease-reproductive-menstrual-disorders,Menstrual Disorders,"TREATMENT
• The diet should contain an adequate, but not excessive, amount of high quality proteins,
preferably from non-meat sources.
• Eat complex carbohydrates (whole grains), to avoid blood sugar drops. This is important.
But do not overeat on anything. Low blood sugar is common during menstruation.
• Include B complex, especially B and B ; along with vitamins C and E. Take brewer's
12 6
yeast, kelp, and essential fatty acids.
• B vitamins, especially B and folic acid, help reduce some of the tensions associated
6
with menstruation.
• Deficiencies of essential fatty acids, together with cyclic hormonal patterns, produce the
classic symptoms of fragile emotions, irritability, etc.
• Take vitamin A as beta-carotene during the last 14 days of the cycle.
• Iron is vital because of the loss of blood each month. Vitamin C helps the body absorb
iron. Beware of supplemental iron during pregnancy! Iron-rich sources include blackstrap
molasses (best single source), apricots, and raisins. Iodine is also needed, when there is a
blood loss. Eat kelp or dulse.
• Calcium supplementation is very important, if you want to avoid painful cramps!
• Cramping may be relieved by additional intake of calcium and niacin.
• Manganese is needed for normal reproduction and the mammary glands, and helps
prevent osteoporosis.
• Vitamin B helps restore normal menstrual cycles.
12
• Limiting salt and fluid intake a short time before menstrual onset may help reduce edema
in the legs and elsewhere in the body.
• Food allergies can be involved in painful menstruation. In one study, eight patients were
freed of the problem when all foods they were allergic to were eliminated (see ""Allergies""
and ""Pulse Test"").
• Allergenic foods most frequently listed were whey, milk, eggs, beef, chocolate, nuts,
fish, beans, cauliflower, pepper, and cabbage.
• Avoid overeating! This encourages abdominal congestion.
• A low-salt diet helps relieve bloating and water retention.
• Taking the birth control pill greatly upsets the entire hormonal system, and it does not
recover, even after the pill is stopped for many months or years.
• Problems with the pituitary, adrenals, or thyroid may produce amenorrhea, or abnormal
bleeding cycles. Stress or the birth control pill can seriously affect the adrenals (which
produce 20% of the total estrogen used by the body).
• Extreme diets (strict fruitarianism, very low protein diets, or repeated strict weight loss
regimens) can produce amenorrhea.
• Poor body mechanics (poor posture) causes the female organs to move out of place, and
this can affect menstruation. Proper posture tends to reduce cramping.
• Those who have diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing tend to have no menstrual pain.
Avoid belts and tight clothing about the waist.
• Adequate exercise is also needed.
• Avoiding constipation is very important.
• Avoid overfatigue just prior to the period. Maintain a regular daily schedule throughout
the month.
• An excess of stress can also affect menstrual flow and attendant problems.
• Sexual stimulation at that time of the month increases abdominal congestion.
• If you are overweight, lose weight in order to reduce painful periods.
• Using tobacco aggravates menstrual disorders. Smoking induces painful menstruation.
• Take a daily hot sitz bath. If available, add chamomile or juniper needles to the water.
• Or take two hot baths each day at the beginning of menstruation. This draws blood from
the over-congested uterus to the skin.
• A four-minute back massage to an area an inch to the right of the lumbar (small of the
back) spine may bring relief from painful menstruation.
• A hot sitz bath (105o-115o F.) with a hot footbath (110o-117o F.) for 3-10 minutes is
often helpful.
• Drink catnip tea each morning and evening during the period.
• Helpful herbs include: yarrow and blue cohosh in menstrual difficulties; wormwood and
pennyroyal, when there is painful menstruation; chamomile relieves menstrual spasms;
peppermint tea eases the pain; desert tea (ephedra viridis), for delayed or difficult
menstruation; life root, when there is suppressed menstruation; black cohosh when there is
obstructed menstruation; garlic and motherwort, to promote menstrual flow; amaranth and
lady's mantle, when there is excessive menstruation; blazing star, for low-ovarian function
and lack of estrogen.

ENCOURAGEMENT—All heaven is interested in the work going on in this world, to prepare people
to live forever in heaven. It is important that we cooperate with God by accepting Christ as our Saviour
and, by faith in Him, obeying the Ten Commandments.

(Amenorrhea—1; Dysmenorrhea—1;
Metrorrhagia; Oligomenorrhea)
SYMPTOMS—Depression, tension, melancholia, breast tenderness, cramps, fainting, water retention,
rapid heartbeat, and backache may occur.
CAUSES—Menstruation is also called menarche. Women whose general health and resistance are good
are less likely to have menstrual problems.
An irregular cycle often indicates the general state of a woman's health, and is usually the result of
nutritional deficiencies or autointoxication caused by constipation, an organic malfunction, drugs,
vitamin or mineral deficiency, and/or chemicals.
Amenorrhea: Absence or suppression of menstruation.
Dysmenorrhea: Painful or difficult menstruation.
Metrorrhagia: Bleeding between periods.
Oligomenorrhea: Infrequent or scanty menstruation.
Periods tend to stop in athletes and in women who drop below 20% body fat.
There are two types of dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation):
Primary dysmenorrhea usually does not occur until several years after menstruation begins. The pain
begins a few hours before or at the onset of bleeding, may last from a few hours to 1-2 days, and is
generally worst the first day. At first, there is a scanty flow, which increases as the pain subsides.
Secondary dysmenorrhea may start 2-3 days before onset, with pain in the abdomen, small of back, and
on down the legs. It is a more constant pain, but includes sharp cramps, and continues throughout the
period. This type is often linked to a pelvic disorder (inflammation, uterine malposition, endometriosis,
tumors, etc.), which needs to be eliminated in order to lessen or remove the pain.
Hormonal imbalance is usually involved (see ""Premenstrual Syndrome"")."
disease-reproductive-lack-of-menstruation,Lack Of Menstruation,"(Amenorrhea) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,
Formulas)
BASIC APPLICATIONS—Tonic Sitz Bath; cold Pelvic Pack; Graduated Baths, twice daily, for tonic
purposes; short very cold Douche to lower spine, over stomach, and to inner surfaces of thighs; pelvic
massage daily, and especially when period is due.
SUPPRESSED MENSTRUATION—Short Cold Douche to spine, thighs, and over stomach, daily or
twice a day; Hot Footbath or Hot Blanket Pack during the interval between the periods; Hot Hip Pack;
warm vaginal irrigation at 950-1000 F.
GENERAL METHOD—It is very necessary to seek for the problem and not merely to ""treat a
malady."" Apply such measures as may be required for relief of anemia, chlorosis, indigestion, or any
other disturbance of the nutritive functions.
—Also see ""Menstrual Disorders."""
disease-reproductive-painful-menstruation,Painful Menstruation,"(Dysmenorrhea) (J.H. Kellogg, M.D.,
Formulas)
BASIC—Rest in bed during period.
WHEN DUE TO OVARIAN DISEASE (beginning before flow)—Hot Hip and Leg Pack; Hot
Blanket Pack; Fomentation over stomach; hot Pelvic Pack; Revulsive Sitz; hot Colonic, followed by hot
Footbath if flow is checked; hot Douche at 990-1020 F.; very Hot Full Bath (1050-1100 F.) for 5-8
minutes.
WHEN DUE TO UTERINE DISEASE (beginning with, and accompanying, flow)—Hot Hip Pack
with Hot Footbath, followed by Cold Compress to area above stomach and inner surfaces of thighs for
30-40 seconds. For treatment between periods, see ""Metritis, Chronic and Pelvic Congestion.""
WHEN DUE TO INFLAMMATORY DISEASE OF APPENDAGES—Hot Enema, hot
Fomentations, Hot Pelvic Pack, Hot Blanket Pack.
GENERAL METHOD—In addition to the local measures for relief of pain which have been indicated
above, it is in most cases necessary to combat some general disorder to which the local disease may be,
more or less, directly related. See ""Anemia,"" ""Neurasthenia,"" ""Hysteria."" General tonic measures must
be used between the menstrual periods. In chronic ovarian congestion, apply the stomach compress
during the night; daily give a Revulsive Sitz Bath or Hot Pelvic Pack and the very hot vaginal irrigation,
1150-1200 F., for 15 minutes. In cases of deficient development, as in infantile uterus or nerve spasm of
the uterine vessels, employ the Revulsive Sitz Bath, alternate genito-urinary douche, tonic sitz bath,
pelvic and general massage. Surgical measures are often required for permanent relief, but a surprisingly
large number of cases are resolvable without surgery; hence water therapies should be perseveringly
tried before resorting to surgical procedures.
—Also see ""Menstrual Disorders."""
disease-reproductive-uterine-bleeding,Uterine Bleeding,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
BASIC APPLICATIONS—Hot vaginal irrigation; short Hot Hip Pack; Hot Footbath, followed by
Cold Compress over stomach and inner surfaces of thighs. In obstinate cases, cold vaginal irrigation.
Moderately prolonged, very cold, Shallow Sitz Bath at 500-650 F. for 5-15 minutes, accompanied by Hot
Footbath when other measures fail; hot Douche to lower spine area over stomach and inner surfaces of
thighs, twice daily during intervals.
CAUTIONS—Avoid prolonged Hot Sitz Bath, Hot Douche, Hot Leg Bath, Hot Footbath, or Hot Sitz
Bath, and in some cases even Fomentations and hot vaginal irrigation. It is equally necessary to avoid
short cold applications to the lower spine, abdomen, thighs, and feet, as the reflex effects of such
applications increase pelvic and uterine congestion.
GENERAL METHOD—It is always highly important to inquire closely for all possible causes of the
profuse flow. The cause may be simple anemia from defective nutrition, constipation, sexual excess,
enteroptosis, uterine displacement, ovarian or tubal disease, uterine inflammation, or congestion. The
most common cause is vegetation of the endometrium, which must be removed by surgical measures.
The operation must be followed by treatment for chronic metritis. In many instances, several of these
conditions may be combined. Good results generally follow water treatments.
NOTE—The following two paragraphs were typed as part of the ""how to stop bleeding"" section, but
they have been placed here instead because they are lengthy, cover the subject of uterine bleeding well,
and are not effectively duplicated in this present section of Kellogg formulas.
For hemorrhage from the uterus, apply short, very hot fomentations (or the hot douche) to the thighs
and spine while an ice bag is placed over the lower abdomen and a hot vaginal douche is given. Another
very useful procedure for uterine hemorrhage is this: a very short hot douche to the lower back, the inner
surfaces of the thighs, and the soles of the feet. Prolonged cold applications to the same surfaces produce
like effects. These applications may be made either with or without a simultaneous use of the hot uterine
or vaginal douche, according to the severity of the case.
Caution: Cold applications must not be used in cases of menorrhagia (excessive bleeding during
menstruation, either in amount of loss or number of days), except with the utmost care and discretion, on
account of the danger of producing hematoma or hematosalpinx, through the sudden checking of the
outflow of blood. Therefore, use only less strong measures during the first 24 or 36 hours of the period.
Reserve the cold applications to a later time. During the first day: The hot vaginal douche is better and
safer. ""The danger of producing hematoma is, in the author's opinion, very small after the first day.""
Kellogg then tells of a girl who had suffered for nearly a year without relief, although she had gone to
many physicians. When brought to him, she was ""placed at once in a sitz bath of about 500 F. for 15
minutes, the feet being placed in cold water at the same time, with the result that the hemorrhage ceased
at once; and, by continued and repeated application of the cool sitz bath for a few weeks, the difficulty
was relieved. The above measures will not solve the problem when the hemorrhage is due to
vegetations, a uterine fibroid, or a malignant disease. In cases where the hemorrhage is accompanied by
severe nerve pain or acute pelvic inflammation, use very hot rather than very cold applications to the
inside of the thighs and lower back region. This should be brief and the temperature sufficiently high to
be somewhat painful, and is best done by sponging the parts with water at 1400 F. or by applying, for 1-
2 minutes, cloths wrung from 140o F. water."
disease-reproductive-uterine-fibroids,Uterine Fibroids,"TREATMENT
• Taking oral contraceptives increases the likelihood of developing fibroids.
• If found, do not take oral contraceptives with a high-estrogen content; the estrogen may
make them enlarge faster.
• Over 30% of the hysterectomies done in the U.S. are for the purpose of removing
fibroids. But, if possible, do not remove them. Fibroids generally shrink when menopause
begins. This is due to the decreased amount of estrogen in the body from that time
onward.
• An alternate surgery is a myomectomy, which removes the fibroids and leaves the uterus
intact. It is true that there is a slightly higher possibility of complications with a
myomectomy, and the results are not always permanent (50% of the time new fibroids
will appear). But a hysterectomy works havoc with the hormonal system.

ENCOURAGEMENT—God wants us to be happy. He desires to put a new song on our lips, even
praise to our God. He can give you overcoming strength. Walking with Him; you can have peace and
assurance.
SALPINGITIS AND OVARITIS—1
(Fallopian Tube Inflammation;
Ovarian Inflammation)
SYMPTOMS—Tenderness of one or both fallopian tubes; in severe cases there is abdominal pain,
usually felt on both tubes. Vaginal discharge, swelling, fever, possible abscesses. Peritonitis may occur
later. (Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the membranous coat lining the abdominal
cavity (see ""Peritonitis"").
CAUSES—Salpingitis is inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Ovaritis is inflammation of the ovaries.
Ovaritis may involve the substance of the organ (oophoritis) or its surface (perioophoritis), and may be
acute or chronic. These technical words are defined because it is easy to confuse ovaritis and oophoritis
in the medical literature.
The fallopian tubes and ovaries are normally protected by the acidic vagina, the mucous plug of the
cervix, and cilia in the uterus and fallopian tubes. But there are five situations, during which infection
can more easily penetrate those delicate organs:
During menstruation, the vagina is alkaline, the plug is gone, and only a healthy flow protects the
fallopian tubes and ovaries from infection. Sexual activity, during a period, can introduce bacteria.
During and just after childbirth.
Following an abortion. It has been well-documented that abortion clinics tend to operate on a mass-
production basis instead of the careful and sterile conditions one would find in a hospital operating
room.
Use of an IUD is also a significant cause of infection.
General enervation or local congestion, due to a variety of causes—ranging from poor diet, overwork,
constipation, pelvic infections, etc.
Once salpingitis or oophoritis occurs, there is a 70% likelihood of sterility.
• Antibiotics are usually given, but they only work on a short-term basis; and, frequently,
a chronic case of salpingitis follows. While it is being treated, scar tissue and other
blockage can occur on the tubes.
• Whether or not antibiotics are used, it is highly recommended that natural methods also
be used. The objective is to clear up the infection as soon as possible, to prevent possible
sterility.
• Vegetable or juice fasting for a time, followed by all raw fruits and salads; and this
followed by a nourishing vegetarian protein diet. Vitamins A, C, E, and zinc are especially
needed. But also include a full vitamin/mineral supplement.
• These fasts will need to be continued until all acute symptoms are gone. If a chronic
infection has already started, then alternate the fasts with nourishing food.
• Use hot and cold contrast sitz baths, to remove pelvic congestion and infection. Do this 3-
4 times a day. The alternate hot and cold bath pumps healing blood throughout the
affected area.
• Also apply alternate 2-3 minutes hot and 2-3 minutes ice cold compresses directly over
the painful pelvic area.
• Helpful herbs include echinacea, goldenseal, black cohosh, black haw, and bearberry.
ENCOURAGEMENT—You are the Lord's, for He created you. You are His by redemption, for He
gave His life for you. Preserve every portion of the living machinery, so that you may use it for God.
SALPINGITIS AND OVARITIS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
(1) ACUTE FORM —
GENERAL CARE—Rest in bed; hot vaginal irrigation, twice daily; hot pelvic pack; Hot Leg Pack or
Hot Footbath twice daily, followed by cold friction. If suppuration of tubes occurs, operation is usually
necessary. During the first few days, ice bag over inflamed part, interrupted at intervals of 1-3 hours by
Fomentation for 15 minutes or hot and cold pelvic compress for 30 minutes; heat to limbs.
CAUTIONS—Avoid general cold applications and cold applications to the feet.
(2) CHRONIC FORM —
BASIC APPLICATIONS—Hot vaginal irrigation twice daily; hot rectal irrigation once daily, if
exudation in pelvis is extensive; pelvis massage. General tonic applications; general massage; sunbaths;
out-of-door exposure with proper protection, carefully avoiding chill; nourishing and blood-building
diet. If suppuration is present, give drainage. Removal of the diseased appendages is sometimes
required, but in most cases this may be avoided by the proper application of water treatments at the
outset.
ENDOMETRIOSIS (Ovarian Cysts)
SYMPTOMS—Abdominal pain, back pain, pelvic pain, constipation, bladder problems, bleeding
between periods, very painful menstrual cramps, and the passing of large clots and shreds of tissue
during the menses. Thirty percent have no symptoms. Iron anemia is common.
CAUSES—Tissue cells, which appear to be like those in the endometrium (the lining of the uterus),
grow elsewhere in the abdominal cavity: the ligaments, ovary, bladder, rectum, bowel, appendix, etc.
They rarely occur outside the pelvic area.
These tissue implants, wherever they settle in the body, will be affected by estrogen and will bleed
during the monthly.
Endometriosis is generally diagnosed between 30 and 40 years of age. About 25-30% of white women
have it, but rarely among blacks. It tends to run in families, passing from mother to daughter.
The problem lessens during pregnancy and lactation, and sometimes does not return. But, more often, it
does and continues until menopause; after which time, it becomes inactive, though scar tissue remains.
A frequent result of endometriosis is the inability to become pregnant. Most women who have the
disorder have never been pregnant.
When internal fetal monitors are placed in an expectant mother, the chances of later developing
endometriosis are increased threefold.
Avoiding sexual activity during menstruation reduces the risk of developing this disorder.
• Hot and cold sitz baths, for 20-30 minutes at a time, help reduce congestion, as may a
hot footbath for 30 minutes. Conclude either treatment with a cold mitten friction.
• Hot fomentations to the lower abdomen are helpful; and, it is reported, when this is done
faithfully, there frequently is complete remission.
• An ice bag, hot water bottle, or heating pad may be placed on the lower abdomen or
back.
• The diet must also be improved. Follow directions specified elsewhere in these articles.
• Do not use caffeine products, for this aggravates the pain.
• A diet high in sugar and white-flour products contributes to endometriosis.
• Eliminate foods containing hormones and antibiotics, since they upset the natural
balance in the body and can lead to endometriosis. Such foods include meat and dairy
products (including eggs).
• Eat a nutritious diet, which includes much raw food, and is high in fiber, B vitamins, and
E. Also needed is calcium, magnesium (to reduce nervous tension), iron, and potassium.
• Fast for 3 days (on distilled water and fresh fruit and vegetable juices) each month
before the anticipated beginning of the menstrual period.
• Helpful herbs include black cohosh, to balance hormones; echinacea and goldenseal, to
eliminate infections; cayenne, to stop bleeding; and burdock, to cleanse the blood.
• Tampons reduce the internal flow and can increase the likelihood of developing or
increasing the implants. They also increase pain and cramping.
• Women with endometriosis frequently have a difficult time getting pregnant (see
""Fertility Problem"").
• A hysterectomy will not solve the problem if implants have occurred elsewhere in the
pelvic region.
ENCOURAGEMENT—With the rich promises of the Bible before you, you can have assurance of
God's love for you. As you read the promises, remember they are the expression of unutterable love and
pity. He loves you.

(Fibroids, Uterine Fibroma)
SYMPTOMS—In half of all cases, there are no symptoms. But these growths can cause abnormally
heavy and frequent menstrual periods, or even result in infertility. Other possible indications: anemia,
fatigue, bleeding between periods, weakness from blood loss, increased vaginal discharge, bleeding after
intercourse.
CAUSES—A uterine fibroid is a benign tumor, varying in size from a millet seed to a size large enough
to fill the entire abdominal cavity. May be single or multiple. The tumors are completely covered by a
fibrous connective tissue capsule.
Fibroids rarely cause symptoms before the age of 30, but is common after that age, especially among
blacks; 20-30% of women have them. The type of symptoms shown depends on where the fibroids are
located. They can exert pressure and cause pain to the bladder, bowels, or even block the urethra
(producing kidney obstruction).
When they produce no symptoms, they should be left alone, but should be removed if unusually rapid
growth occurs.
If the flow is far too heavy or rapid, you may have interfering fibroids."
disease-reproductive-prostate-disorders,Prostate Disorders,"TREATMENT
• Avoid sexual stimulation without a natural conclusion (an orgasm). Continued
stimulation leads to a prolonged engorgement. This is not good for the prostate.
• Avoiding sexual activity entirely is the best way to care for your prostate in the older
years.
• Maintain optimal physical and emotional health. Avoid that which is sexually
stimulating.
• Regular exercise outdoors in the open air is important. Walking for an hour or two every
day is excellent.
• Riding bicycles, motorcycles, or horses may injure the perineum, resulting in congestion
of the prostate.
• Avoid exposure to dampness or cold.
• Avoid constipation. This is important.
• Do not sit for hours on padded seats in cold places (such as buses, trains, etc.). Whenever
possible, sit on a hard chair. This reduces compression.
• Increase fluid intake, in order to flush the kidneys and bladder of toxins and bacteria.
• Do not let the bladder become too full. Urinate as quickly as possible, when the urge
comes. Try to completely empty the bladder each time.
• Do not eat junk food, fried food, caffeine, spices, chocolate, nuts (especially cashews),
or drink alcohol or use nicotine.
• Eat a nourishing diet, including vitamin/mineral supplementation, especially zinc.
• The diets of those who have prostate trouble are usually low in essential fatty acids
(flaxseed oil and wheat germ oil are the best). Never heat these oils.
• Treat it with zinc (50 mg, three times a day), essential fatty acids (flaxseed oil, 1
teaspoon, three times a day), and a high-fiber diet which includes pumpkin seeds and
alfalfa. Vitamin A (as beta-carotene, 300,000 IU a day), vitamin C to bowel tolerance,
chlorophyll (as alfalfa), selenium (250 mcg, three times a day), amino acids (alanine,
glycine, and glutamic acid; 5 grams each, daily for 90 days), and cranberry juice (2 pints a
day).
• Many medicinal drugs, including pilocarpine, irritate the prostate.
• When there is an acute condition, take hot sitz baths daily and add chamomile tea to the
water.
• Also helpful is a short cold bath.
• A high charcoal and water enema helps the healing process. Use 1 cup of hot water to 1
teaspoon of powdered charcoal. Allow it to remain as long as possible.
• In order to increase circulation in the area, lay flat on your back on the floor. Then swing
one leg across the other till the knee touches the floor and vice versa. Do this as many
times as you can, and eventually bring it up to 50 repetitions at a time.
• Helpful herbs include echinacea and goldenseal, for bactericide. Horsetail, combined
with hydrangea, helps contract the prostate. Saw palmetto and cayenne are also useful.

ENCOURAGEMENT—Cling to God with all your heart, and He will guide you aright. You need His
help every moment. Trust and obey His Written Word.

(Prostatitis; Enlarged Prostate, Prostate
Hypertrophy; Prostate Cancer)
SYMPTOMS—Pain on urination, frequent urination, urine retention, often a fever. There may be a
discharge.
Acute prostatitis: fever, frequent and burning urination, pain between the scrotum and rectum, a feeling
of fullness in the bladder, pus or blood in the urine.
Chronic prostatitis: frequent and burning urination, blood in the urine, lower back pain, impotence
(inability to copulate).
Gradually, urination becomes still more difficult.
CAUSES—The prostate is a doughnut-shaped male reproductive gland. It is under the urinary bladder,
and surrounds the urinary tube (urethra).
Muscles located within the prostate squeeze prostatic fluid into the urethral tract during ejaculation.
Most of the semen consists of this fluid, which provides nourishment and protection for the sperm.
There are three primary prostatic problems:
Prostatitis: This is inflammation of the prostate gland, is common in men of all ages, and is the most
frequent type of prostate problem.
The inflammation tends to block off the urine flow (urine retention), and this causes bacteria to build up.
Sometimes hormonal changes, from aging, may be a contributing factor.
When urine retention results, the bladder becomes distended, weak, tender, and liable to infection.
Infection can easily pass up the ureters to the kidneys.
Enlarged prostate: This is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy. It is the gradual enlargement of the
prostate, and occurs in half of all men over 50, and three-fourths of men over 70. It is probably the most
common infirmity of aging in the human male. More than 500,000 American men are afflicted each
year.
It is believed that, with age, testosterone production and levels decrease, and certain other hormones
(prolactin and estradiol) increase. This results in more of a powerful form of testosterone, called
dihydrotestosterone. This hormone causes an overproduction (hyperplasia) of prostate cells—and that
causes the prostate gland to become larger. As it does, it eventually tends to pinch upon the urethra, and
interfere with the flow of urine.
As a result, neither the bladder nor kidneys empty fully. This produces pressure which can damage them.
Urination becomes more frequent. It flows more slowly, and there may be difficulty in starting and
stopping the flow. Sometimes there is blood in the urine.
Here is how to check your own prostate:
The prostate can be felt (palpated) with the gloved finger. If you are going to do this effectively, you
would need to examine it monthly. The normal prostate is firm like an orange and about the size of a
walnut. You would reach into the rectum, to carry out this examination. The prostate is found at a depth
in the rectum that is just comfortably in reach of the index finger. An acute case of enlargement may be
hard while a chronic enlargement may be boggy. Tumors, either benign or malignant tend to be irregular
and nodular.
Prostatic cancer: An enlarged prostate can become cancerous; but, fortunately, it always proceeds very,
very, slowly. So slowly, in fact, that an operation to remove the prostate, because of cancer, is generally
not needed. This is because, before the man is likely to die of prostate cancer, he is quite aged and dies
of something else first. But, of course, you will want to consult your medical specialist.
The suggestions below are for prostate problems, in general. For more information on home care, in
those instances in which cancer is present, see ""Cancer.""
Vasectomy, for sterilization, has been linked to prostate disorders and even cancer."

Birth and Children
Part 1
Fertility

SYMPTOMS—Progressive wasting and shriveling of the testes.
CAUSES—This condition is not uncommon in aging men. It can also follow an episode of mumps.
Testicular atrophy may result in lessened sexual drive and possible feminization."
disease-reproductive-pregnancy-related-problems,Pregnancy Related Problems,"SYMPTOMS—A variety of problems can occur during pregnancy—ranging from backache,
constipation, stretch marks, and gas, to hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and miscarriage.
INTRODUCTION—Pregnancy is that special 40-week period between conception and birth when the
child grows and develops. A weight gain of 20-35 pounds is desirable and, in most cases, is in keeping
with good health. But a number of problems can occur. Here are several of them. For more information,
see ""Morning Sickness,"" ""Premature Labor,"" and ""Miscarriage.""
Many of the problems occurring during pregnancy are related to hormonal changes, nutritional needs, or
various expansion pressures as the fetus continues to grow.
NUTRITION—Proper nutrition is important. There is a 20% increase of blood volume during
pregnancy. This requires additional complete protein.
A healthy diet during this time would include 2 fruits a day, 7 vegetables (including salads, grains, and
other worthwhile foods), etc. Complex carbohydrates, best obtained in whole grains, are important.
Complete, vitamin/mineral supplementation is also important.
Vitamin A protects the immune system and avoids eye abnormalities, cleft lip, and cleft palate. Do not
let vitamin A intake go over 10,000 IU daily. Excessive intake of vitamin A is linked to cleft palate,
heart defects, and other congenital defects. Foods rich in vitamin A may also cause problems. But foods
with natural beta-carotene are not harmful. (This is because it is only converted to vitamin A as it is
needed.)
All the B complex is important. They help prevent leg, back, and joint pains in the mother during
pregnancy.
Vitamin B (thiamine) prevents stillbirths, low-birth weight babies, and heart disorders. In late
1
pregnancy and post-delivery, B requirements are greatly increased.
1
Vitamin B (riboflavin) prevents short limbs and cleft palate.
2
Vitamin B (niacin, niacinamide) prevents irritability, depression, disorientation, fatigue, nervousness,
3
and muscular weakness.
Vitamin B (pyridoxine) prevents several fetal abnormalities, including seizures, cleft lip, and cleft
6
palate. Take 100 mg daily until birth, followed by only 50 mg daily. This is because an excess of B
6
after delivery can hinder the amount of mother's milk produced.
Folic acid prevents anemia and birth defects. It is involved in cell growth and DNA production. But it is
vital that this supplementation be started prior to conception. Take 400 mg daily. If there is not enough
folic acid in the system during the first six weeks of pregnancy, spina bifida and anencephaly can result.
But most women do not know they are pregnant until several weeks after conception has occurred.
Therefore it is crucial that you be taking this vitamin regularly.
Vitamin C prevents infections and small babies.
Vitamin D works with calcium, to build strong bones.
All the vitamins are very important, but so are the minerals.
Magnesium helps prevent birth abnormalities and miscarriage.
Calcium prevents weak bones and teeth, premature births, and damaged nerves.
Although phosphorous is important you always get enough in your food. Too much blocks iron and
calcium absorption. Soft drinks eliminate calcium. See ""Bones, Strengthening.""
The trace minerals are also important. Nova Scotia dulse and Norwegian kelp are good sources.
Iodine prevents thyroid problems, abnormal development, and certain types of mental retardation.
Zinc prevents dwarfism and limb defects.
Manganese prevents certain brain abnormalities.
Inadequate folic acid, manganese, and zinc (as well as amino acid imbalances) have been linked to
mental retardation and deformities in the fetus.
Do not eat junk food of any type. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, spicy, fried, or overly processed
foods. If possible, avoid all drugs.
SPECIAL NOTES—If at all possible, have your baby by natural childbirth—and with the help of a
midwife.
Be sure and breast-feed your baby for at least the first three months, and longer if possible. (see ""Breast-
feeding."")
Do not use an electric blanket. Studies indicate it may increase risk of miscarriage and problems in
development.
Aspirin has been linked to fetal deformities, bleeding, and complications during pregnancy.
Do not use cinnamon in large quantities during pregnancy.
The drug, etretinate (Tegison), is prescribed for psoriasis, and can cause birth defects.
Avoid the following herbs during pregnancy: feverfew, goldenseal, black cohosh, tansy, angelica,
bloodroot, celandine, dong quai, Oregon grape, rue, cat's claw, barberry, cottonwood bark, and
pennyroyal.
Keep yourself healthy, so you can continue eating an adequate diet. Avoid long fasts, cleansing diets, or
strictly limited diets during pregnancy and lactation (see ""Eclampsia"").
Do not take anything containing shark cartilage during pregnancy. It reduces production of new blood
vessels.
Do not take supplements containing phenylalanine. This is an amino acid which can alter brain growth
in the fetus. The sweetener, Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet), contains high levels of phenylalanine.
A drug prescribed for acne (isotretinoin, under the trade name of Accutane) can cause birth defects.
Avoid mineral oil; it inhibits the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
Two medications, used to control seizures, increase by four times the risk of producing a baby with heart
defects. These drugs are phenobarbital and phenytoin (Dilantin).
Drinking large quantities of coffee, cola drinks, or other caffeine sources can result in birth defects.
Certain chemicals in drugs can stunt fetal growth. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and
others); antacids (Pepto-Bismol, Alka-Seltzer, Rolaids, Tums, Di-Gel, Maalox, Gelusil); aspirin; cough
remedies; cold pills; antihistamines; estrogens; and decongestants.
INDIGESTION—Eat smaller meals and chew your food well. Acidophilus, peppermint tea, ginger, and
aloe vera juice will help. Also see ""Indigestion."" Do not take baking soda to alleviate indigestion,
because the sodium content will increase fluid retention.
ANEMIA—It is important enough that you obtain enough iron, so you can avoid simple anemia.
Natural iron herbal formulas, which include yellow dock and dandelion, will build up the blood.
Chlorophyll, kelp, dulse, rice bran, whole grains, beans, dried apricots, and green leafy vegetables are
other sources. But the very best source of iron is blackstrap molasses.
You should be aware of the fact that bottled iron supplement tablets frequently have the wrong kind of
iron in them. Because it is not natural, it can block the absorption of vitamins E and A. Vitamin E is the
antiabortion vitamin, and is needed in order to bring a baby to full term. Also see ""Anemia.""
CONSTIPATION—Constipation can lead to high blood pressure, water retention, toxemia (toxic
blood), and injure both the mother and baby. It can also produce leg cramps, backache fatigue, and
varicose veins. Also see ""Constipation.""
BACKACHE—The increase in weight and shift in center of gravity can cause problems if the mother
does not maintain proper posture and avoid fatigue. The hormone, progesterone, tends to relax the
muscles.
Do not wear high-heeled shoes, and do not stay in one position too long (see ""Backache"").
DIZZINESS—Especially during the second trimester, blood pressure drops as the uterus presses on
major blood vessels.
Do not arise or change positions quickly. Breathe deeper when you sense that you need to do so.
BLEEDING GUMS—The gums tend to swell and become softer because of increased estrogen output.
Give your teeth and gums special care, lest bleeding and infection occur.
GAS—Flatulence will tend to occur more frequently during pregnancy than normally. Try to determine
which foods are causing the problem. Make sure you are obtaining enough fresh fruit and vegetables.
(Also see ""Bloating."")
MOOD CHANGES—Hormonal changes, stress, and nutritional needs affect this. Be sure and obtain
enough B complex vitamins. Know that mood changes during pregnancy are normal and generally
temporary.
FREQUENT URINATION—Changes in kidney function and uterine expansion frequently cause this.
But do not reduce intake of liquids, thinking this will solve the problem!
GROIN PRESSURE—Ligaments near the uterus can kink and spasm, causing a ""stitch"" on the right
side. In later pregnancy, more direct pressure on the groin area can occur.
During a spasm, breathe deeply and bend toward the point of pain. Lay down and rest until the pain
leaves. Be sure and maintain adequate daily exercises.
INSOMNIA—This is especially likely during the final weeks of pregnancy. At this time, it is more
difficult to sleep comfortably.
Do not sleep until you feel like doing so. Include more B complex vitamins in your diet. (Also see
""Insomnia."")
HEARTBURN—The expanding uterus presses on the stomach and causes fluids to push back up into
the esophagus.
Do not eat fried, greasy, spicy foods. Avoid baking soda, coffee, alcohol, and antacids.
Do not bend over or lay flat for several hours after a meal.
While in bed, place pillows under or behind your abdomen. (Also see ""Heartburn."")
VARICOSE VEINS—These will usually disappear after childbirth. Walk a mile a day, to increase
circulation. Change positions frequently, and never cross your legs. Sit with feet elevated. If necessary,
wear support hose. Do not wear bands on the legs (see ""Varicose Veins"").
HEMORRHOIDS—Constipation and uterine pressure can induce formation of these. Drink more
water. Increase intake of roughage, to soften stools. Keep legs elevated on a stool while eliminating.
Apply cold witch hazel compresses to help shrink them. (Also see ""Hemorrhoids."")
STRETCH MARKS—These are strips (often wave-like) which appear on the abdomen, breasts,
buttocks, and thighs. They are pressure marks and do not totally leave, but after childbirth can become
difficult to see.
Apply oil, once a day, all over the areas where the marks are likely to appear. The formula includes ½
cup of olive oil, ¼ cup of aloe vera gel, 6 capsules of vitamin E, and 4 capsules of vitamin A. Cut open
the capsules, mix it all together, and apply.
LEG CRAMPS—Extra weight on the legs, nutritional deficiencies, and too much salt in the diet can
cause this.
Elevate the legs while sleeping, so they are higher than your heart. Do not stand in one place too long.
Flex your feet every so often. Take adequate calcium and potassium. Apply a heating pad to the
cramping area.
ENCOURAGEMENT—With the eye of faith, with child-like submission, trust your life to God, and
He will wonderfully guide you. His promise is, ""I will instruct and teach you."""
disease-reproductive-premature-labor,Premature Labor,"TREATMENT
• A balanced high-protein diet. Do not restrict salt. Take seaweed products for trace
minerals, also a full vitamin/mineral supplement. (See ""Pregnancy-related Problems"" for a
detailed list of nutritional needs.)
• Take B (100 mg daily until birth, then only 50 mg daily) and 10-12 glasses of water or
6
fruit juice a day, especially in the hot months.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The old song says, ""Trust and obey, for there is no other way, to be happy in
Jesus, but to trust and obey."" And how very true that is.
BREAST-FEEDING; INFANT FEEDING
(Lactation; Nursing)
TOPIC—Helpful suggestions on nursing your child. Try to nurse him for 9 months, if at all possible.
NUTRITION—Breast-fed babies are less susceptible to SIDS. In addition, they have less allergies,
respiratory diseases, hypoglycemia, obesity, and gastroenteritis. In addition, both mother and child are
happier and bond together better. The infant has better health and adapts much better to later physical
and emotional situations which develop.
A high-calcium diet is very important in maintaining a good milk supply. (See ""Bones, Strengthening""
for lots of information on obtaining enough calcium.) Be sure and get enough sunshine for vitamin D.
A high-protein diet is also very important. Take B complex, plus all the other vitamins and minerals,
along with a sizeable amount of brewer's yeast at every meal. You tend to have to stuff yourself on yeast
and calcium foods in order to have enough milk for your baby.
Keep yourself healthy, so you can continue eating an adequate diet. Avoid long fasts, cleansing diets, or
strictly limited diets during lactation.
Keep your bowels open, and clean with high-fiber foods.
Drink lots of lemon juice.
Avoid sage tea, for it dries up the milk.
Avoid mental depression, violent exercise, beans, onions, and cabbage. They upset the baby.
Do not smoke while nursing! Avoid caffeine, liquor, junk food, fried food, and drugs.
Be happy, rest often, and pray that God will help you raise a child who is dedicated to Him.
To increase milk supply, helpful herbs include milkweed, caraway, goat's rue, and fenugreek.
To reduce milk supply (or the pain of breast engorgement), the herb, goldenrod, is helpful.
For sore nipples, use sunshine or the light of a light bulb close enough to feel warm but not burn.
From the beginning, give the baby a little water, gradually increasing the amount. Give tomato juice,
starting with a half teaspoonful at about the age of one month. At 3 months, begin a little blended food.
By 9 months, the baby should be eating a variety of carefully prepared natural foods.
When the baby is six months old, dilute 4 teaspoons of whole-wheat flakes in boiling water till entirely
dissolved, put through a fine sieve, and add to the baby's bottle (if you are giving him a bottle by then).
A little powdered oatmeal can also be added.
When the first teeth appear, begin feeding wholesome simple foods in puree form, such as greens,
vegetables, fruit juices, and gruels.
Do not give the infant cane sugar in any form. This can lead to fever and various ailments. Use malt
sugar. Do not give infants honey or orange juice.
Do not give the infant meat!
Feeding an infant meat, cane sugar, white-flour products, candies, or soft drinks causes him to lose his
taste for simple, natural foods; and is responsible for rickets, scurvy, tonsil trouble, night terrors, anemia,
and convulsions.
BREAST-FEEDING—There are certain principles which, if followed, will avoid sore, fissured, and
possibly infected nipples.
Try to wash your hands before handling your breasts.
Position the baby properly. His entire body should face you. His buttocks should be in one hand, and his
head in the bend of your elbow.
The other hand is under the breast, with all four fingers supporting it. But do not place your fingers on
the areola (the darker area around the nipple).
(If—if—your hands are clean, you can rub the nipple lightly to firm it. Pinching it lightly flattens the
nipple, to fit his mouth better.)
Do not try to toughen your nipples by vigorously rubbing them. This can damage them.
As you tickle the baby's lower lip with your nipple, his mouth will open wide. When it is open wide, pull
his body in quickly. His mouth should fix on the areola, and the nipple should be deep in his throat. At
least an inch of the areola should be in his mouth. In this way, there is no movement of the nipple as the
infant sucks.
If you feel pain, do not delay, but immediately use your finger to break the suction and reposition him.
Place a finger inside the corner of the infant's mouth to allow air to enter and break the vacuum.
La Leche says that 95% of the nipple soreness problems are caused by the way the baby sucks, and can
be corrected.
Leave him on a breast as long as he is sucking effectively (swallowing every suck or two). If he begins
pausing, burp him, wake him, switch sides, and let him nurse as long as he wants. Feeding time is
usually 20-30 minutes.
(But, for the first few days, it may be necessary to limit feeding periods to 5 minutes on each breast,
before rotating to the other. It is very important that you work with the baby properly, so that you avoid
fissures developing on, or near, the nipple.)
Do not let him remain on the breast after he has finished actively feeding. (See ""Mastitis"" for reasons for
many of these precautions.)
The next time you start, begin on the breast you ended with previously. Always have him nurse on both
sides.
You will find that the baby will want to nurse often—frequently 8-12 times a day in the early weeks.
God designed that these frequent feedings would bond the infant to his mother.
Break the suction of the infant's mouth on the breast by inserting a finger into the corner of his mouth,
not just pulling the nipple out of his mouth.
After feeding, empty the breasts manually or with a breast pump until supply and demand reach an
equilibrium.
Air-dry the breasts after each feeding, before covering them. (Exposing the breasts to the air for 20
minutes at a time, two or three times a day, is helpful.) A 40-watt bulb can be placed near them for 15
minutes at a time. Never use breast pads that might retain moisture (especially those with plastic in
them). Do not wear bras with plastic liners. If needed, place a folded handkerchief there.
Nipple cleanliness is important, but never use soap on the nipples; it dries them out. The milk contains
its own oil and also a self-cleaning antiseptic. Leave a little on at the end of each feeding, to lubricate
and soften the nipple.
Baby saliva contains an enzyme which softens the skin. So, if possible, wash the nipples with clean
water. (Water or alcohol applied to the nipple will toughen the skin and assist in preventing sore
nipples.) Or, better yet, place some mother's milk on them.
If a nipple becomes sore, put a little milk on it. The nipples should be checked daily; and, if they are sore
or cracked, treatment should begin promptly; do not wait. (See ""Mastitis."")
Clothing worn next to the breast should always be soft and non-irritating. Cotton is generally best.
Avoid plugged ducts. Binding clothes, fatigue, or prolonged periods without nursing can cause them. If
not dealt with promptly, infection can begin. A place on the breast will feel hard and painful to the
touch. Get rid of it by massaging the breast, starting at the chest wall and working down with a circular
motion. It is important that you let the baby nurse on that side frequently. The sucking clears out the duct
better than anything else, generally within 24 hours.
Feed the baby before the breasts become too full; the infant has difficulty grasping the breast. Stasis of
milk (when it is not flowing on out, but remaining in the breast too long) helps lead to mastitis.
If the baby is fed before he is hungry, he will not suck the nipple too vigorously. Never allow him to
chew the nipple.
If the nipples become sore, place some cold grocery-store tea (containing tannic acid) on a folded tissue
and lay it on the area for 20 minutes; then dry and expose it to air for 20 minutes. Rinse it before the
next nursing. The tannic acid will promote healing.
Poultices of comfrey root or leaf may be used for sore nipples.
If a nipple is cracked, pierce a vitamin E capsule and apply the oil just after nursing. Do not use very
much.
If the baby is not taking as much milk as you are producing, and you are getting too full, apply hot, wet,
compresses to the breast. This will open up the ducts and increases the flow. Then nurse the baby more
often and longer. Drink more fluids, so you can urinate every hour.
—Also see ""Mastitis."" That article will also explain prebirth preparation of the nipples.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Only the love that flows from the heart of Christ can heal. Only He can restore
the wounded soul. Submit your life to Him every day and obey His Written Word, and you will find the
help you need.

SYMPTOMS—The baby is born a number of weeks ahead of schedule.
CAUSES AND PREVENTION—Premature labor is the onset of rhythmic uterine contractions prior to
fetal maturity, and is most likely to occur between the 20th and 37th weeks. About 5%-10% of infant
deaths are premature.
For possible causes and prevention, read ""Miscarriage."" It may avert this possibility.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The closer we are to God, the happier we are. Take time with Him in prayer.
Lay out before Him all your trials and sorrows, and He can provide the answers you need.
# CHILDBIRTH
TOPIC—A few helpful facts about when you give birth to your child.
TO MAKE LABOR EASIER—Take training classes, to help you relax during contractions, to reduce
pains, help train the coach to assist, and how to recognize potential problems.
Helpful herbs include blue cohosh and corn ergot.
TO STOP POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE—Raspberry tea can be used to stop post-partum
hemorrhage. Give it either orally or intramuscularly).
TO STOP AFTER-BIRTH PAINS—Wild yam, cramp bark, and black haw are specific herbs which
help reduce after-birth pains and cramping throughout the pelvic area. Hot fomentations over the area,
after a warming liniment has been rubbed into the skin, is useful.
Warm whole baths help the pain subside. Make sure the bathtub is sterile beforehand.
Fast on vegetable juices and broths until the pains are gone.
Once the pain is relieved, apply a castor oil pack for an hour.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Let God's Word, the Bible, be a lamp to your feet and a light to your path. In
Him you can find the help you need.
PRE-ECLAMPSIA; ECLAMPSIA
(Pregnancy Toxemia)
SYMPTOMS—Pre-eclampsia: Sudden weight gain, high blood pressure, albuminuria, headaches,
dizziness, spots before the eyes, epigastric pain, edema (swelling) of the legs and feet.
Eclampsia: Symptoms of pre-eclampsia, plus convulsions and coma. The convulsions begin with
fixation of the eyeballs, rolling of the eyes, twitchings of the face, arms, and hands. Then coma with
temperature at 103o-104o F. The person can die in the coma.
CAUSES—Beginning about the turn of the century, physicians have sometimes prescribed women to
keep their weight down in order to have smaller babies (which are easier for the doctor to deliver).
But such arbitrarily restricted diets—low in protein, salt, and water—can lead to serious consequences.
The sudden weight gain occurs because of fluid retention, due to low blood protein, high blood pressure,
and albuminuria.
If pre-eclampsia is not treated properly, then it develops into eclampsia—an even worse form of the
disorder.
Both forms of this disorder occur after the 20th week of pregnancy. The orthodox treatment is to place
the woman in the hospital, wait until convulsions occur, and then give her barbiturates. But what she
needs is nourishing food.
Diet, blood pressure, and weight must be watched—but proper nutrition and fluid intake is most
important."
disease-reproductive-breast-cancer,Breast Cancer,"TREATMENT
• It is well to keep in mind that people have undergone the orthodox cancer routine of
surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation and have survived while others have died. There are
those who have taken the natural remedies route, with the same end results. No one can, or
ought to, decide for you; the decision is yours.
• In the late 1980s, researchers discovered that women develop breast cancer far more
frequently in certain localities than in others. Analyzing those locations, it was discovered
that they are those areas where there tends to be less sunlight throughout the year. For
example, northwestern California, the western slopes of Oregon and Washington, and the
Northeast had a far greater number of breast cancer cases than did Florida, Texas,
Arizona, and southern California. The solution: Take sunbaths whenever you can,
throughout the year; sunlight is important for maintaining good health, purifying the body,
and resisting infection.
• Breast cancer more often occurs in women who started menstruation early in their youth,
had a late menopause, gave birth later in life, had a family history of breast cancer,
developed obesity after menopause, and had a history of alcoholism and eating a high-fat
diet.
• Research indicates that those who take oral contraceptives are 3 times more likely to
develop breast cancer. Silicone (used in breast implants) causes cancer in test animals.
Those who develop breast, and other, cancers have less vitamin A in their bodies.
• Eat a nutritious diet centered around fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts.
Eat garlic and onions. Drink distilled water and fresh fruit and vegetable juices. Get extra
fiber.
• Do not eat too much soy or peanut products.
• Avoid meat; dairy products; alcohol; caffeine; nicotine; and processed, fried, white-
flour, and junk foods. Do not take supplements containing iron.
• You should examine your breasts regularly. Procedures for doing this, and what to watch
for, are discussed in many other books. You will be able to detect initial changes better
than anyone else. If you experience itching, redness, and soreness of the
nipples—especially if you are not currently breast-feeding a baby—check with a
physician. You might have Paget's disease of the nipple, a form of cancer. See ""Paget's
Disease.""
—Read the sections on ""Cancer"" and ""Cancer Prevention"" for detailed information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Take all your problems to God in prayer. He can wonderfully change the most
hopeless outlook. And whatever happens will be for the best, if we are trusting in Him.

SYMPTOMS—In the most common types: Lumps are firm, do not go away, and are generally pain free.
Lumps which do not move around may be malignant or may not be.
In another type: There is itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple.
In yet a third type: The breast becomes extremely tender and appears infected with something.
These three are explained in more detail below.
CAUSES—Breast cancer is a leading cause of malignant death among women in the United States.
Women over forty are more likely to develop breast cancer than younger women. Lung cancer kills
about 56,000 women in America each year, and breast cancer is responsible for the death of about
46,000.
It is vital that early detection be made. Discussions of how to carry out breast self-examination are
readily available elsewhere and need not be repeated here. As you conduct it, watch for subtle changes
in the breast. You are looking for special types of lumps in the breast. These lumps are firm, do not go
away, and are generally pain free. Lumps which do not move around may be malignant or may be
caused by normal fibrocystic changes during the menstrual cycle. The experts say a biopsy will detect
what kind of lump it is.
But you should know that biopsies can be dangerous. A biopsy is a slice of the tissue which is then sent
to a lab for microscopic examination. The problem is that slicing any suspected tissue—immediately
releases its cancer (if any is present) into the body, where it can more rapidly spread. You may or may
not choose to have biopsies made, but you should be aware of this fact.
You will often hear it said that ""1 in 9"" women will contract breast cancer—but that is sometime within
a lifetime. The average 30-year-old white woman has a 1 in 5,900 chance of getting it; at 50 years, it is 1
in 430.
There are several different types of breast cancer. Most of them are similar, producing lumps described
above. But a few are different:
Paget's disease of the nipple affects the nipple, and cannot be detected by a self-examination. Cancer
cells have migrated to the nipple. The symptoms are itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple. This
form of cancer only occurs when a different form of cancer is present elsewhere in breast tissue.
Inflammatory carcinoma is a different type. The skin thickens and turns red. The breast becomes
extremely tender and appears infected with something. The lymphatic system and blood vessels have
become clogged because of a tumor. This type of cancer spreads very rapidly. Professionals recommend
a biopsy; but, if you choose not to do so, you must be planning to go on an intense natural remedies
cleansing, to eliminate the problem. Whatever you do, you had better set to work and do it."
disease-reproductive-prostate-cancer,Prostate Cancer,"TREATMENT
• Contact your physician.
• Go on a program with a nourishing diet, vitamin and mineral supplementation, and out-
of-door exercise.
• Do not eat meat. There is a definite correlation between red meat consumption and
prostate cancer.
• Drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices daily.
• Avoid processed and junk foods.
—Read the sections on ""Cancer"" and ""Cancer Prevention"" for detailed information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—No friend can help us as wonderfully as God can. Go to Him in prayer and ask
for His help. Trust your life to Him, and believe that He will work everything out for the best.

SYMPTOMS—Possible pain or burning sensation during urination, frequent urination, a decrease in
the size and force of urine flow, an inability to urinate, blood in the urine, and continuing lower-back or
pelvic discomfort just above the pubic area. But there may be no symptoms until an advanced stage or
until the cancer spreads out beyond the prostate.
Many, many, times the above symptoms point to a benign enlargement of the prostate and is not cancer
in that organ.
CAUSES—The prostate is a walnut-sized gland at the base of the bladder and encircles the urethra, the
tube through which the bladder voids urine. The prostate makes prostatic fluid which nourishes the
sperm.
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Americans. Poor diet, exposure to
environmental toxins and cancer-causing chemicals, and overactivity of the sexual organs are possible
causes. There is a link between a high-fat diet and prostate cancer. It is believed, by some, that a
vasectomy may increase the likelihood that this problem will later develop.
Men over 65 have 80% of the cases of prostate cancer, and 80% of 80-year-old men have it.
The younger a man is, when he is diagnosed with prostrate cancer, the worse the outlook. Those with
recurring prostate infections are at greater risk. Men whose ancestors had prostate cancer are more likely
to develop it. African American men have the highest rate, and Asiatic American men have the lowest.
A careful, but relatively simple, rectal examination can reveal if cancer is developing in this organ.
There are also other screening methods, and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) appears to be the best. The
PSA test should be taken twice if there is an indication of cancer.

disease-respiratory-common-cold,Common Cold,"TREATMENT
• A cold is the result of not living on the best level. Once it arrives, it cleanses toxins from
the system and, along with the rest, enables the person to get back into better shape. A
cold is actually a blessing, for it forces people to rest who, otherwise, would prematurely
develop debilitating, chronic, and life-threatening diseases.
• A cold is always in the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, and upper
bronchials). If congestion develops in the chest, the cold is worsening into something even
more serious!
• Do not ignore a cold and drag on with your work. As soon it develops—go to bed, drink
fresh lemon juice in water, and settle down to getting well!
• If you do not know how to take care of yourself, you had better contact a physician,
especially if:
(1) Chills and shortness of breath occur.
(2) An accompanying fever goes above 101o F. for more than three days, or
any fever above 103oF.
(3) Yellow or white spots appear in the throat.
(4) The lymph nodes under the jaw and in the neck become enlarged.
(5) Any hot, extreme pain, such as earache, swollen tonsils, sinus pain, or
aching lungs or chest occurs.
(6) There is excessively large amounts of sputum or sputum that is greenish
or bloody.
(7) There is extreme difficulty swallowing.
(8) Wheezing occurs.
(9) There is shortness of breath.
• If you have a sore throat, beware of white or yellow patches on the throat. These can be
Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, which can damage the heart muscle. Have a throat
swab done when there might be a question about this.
• Children with high fevers should see a physician within 24 hours.
• Treatment should include as much vitamin C as you can take, without producing
diarrhea (up to 5,000 mg at a time). In acute cases, 1,000 mg of C every other hour. Also
take bioflavonoids (200-600 mg), small amounts garlic. (along with vitamin C, it is an
excellent germ fighter), vitamin A (50,000 units for not more than one month; then down
to 25,000 units), calcium lactate or gluconate (6 tablets), brewer's yeast, B6 (100 mg; it is
a natural antihistamine, as well as providing helpful protein), vitamin E (600 units),
betaine hydrochloride, zinc gluconate lozenges, and vitamin F (unsaturated fatty acids)
reduces the frequency and duration of colds.
• In acute stages when fever is present, the person should abstain from all solid foods and
only drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices, diluted (50-50) with water, plus herb teas. The
proper treatment of colds is to encourage elimination through all channels, so that
elimination through one channel does not become excessive.
• As soon as the crisis subsides, let the person have some protein and other food.
• Drink potato peeling broth twice a day. The peelings should be one-half inch thick
(throw away the centers). Boil it for about 20-30 minutes; strain, cool, and drink. Make it
fresh every day.
• Avoid chills, get adequate bed rest, and take a little salt to replace that lost in sweat.
• After the fever subsides, a low calorie raw fruit and vegetable diet can be eaten. This
should include plenty of raw juices and herb teas, sweetened with a little honey. Some raw
seeds and nuts can be eaten, but should be chewed well.
• Herb teas can include rose hips, golden seal, chamomile, peppermint, slippery elm,
ginger, desert tea. Eucalyptus oil is helpful. Put 5 drops in a hot bath or 6 drops in a cup of
boiling water. Put a towel over your head and, without burning yourself, inhale it. Licorice
root tea, drunk daily, soothes an irritated throat and relieves coughing. You might wish to
take hop tea to help you get to sleep at night.
• Avoid aspirin (especially for children), since it causes internal bleeding. There is also
another problem: What you think is of little consequence may be flu or
chickenpox—which are caused by a virus. Colds are also. When children who have
certain viral infections take aspirin, their risk of developing Reye's syndrome is greatly
increased! This is a rare but fatal brain and liver disease. The same warning applies to cold
medications containing aspirin.
• As already mentioned, take vitamin C, zinc, and garlic. Avoid being depressed; try to be
cheerful. There is healing in this. Keep looking to Jesus and praying to God. Let a friend
read a Bible promise to you every so often; think about it. Rest and relax and do not
worry. Keep warm, but get fresh air from time to time. Take a lot of liquids. Gargle three
times a day with saltwater (1 glass of warm water with 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in). Take
a hot shower.
There are a variety of water treatments which can be applied:
• Take a hot mustard foot bath to increase eliminations and reduce head and sinus
congestion.
• Take a hot Epsom salt bath while drinking sweating teas. Pour Epsom salts (1-2 lbs.)
into a hot tub. While soaking, drink 2-3 cups of hot pleurisy root tea. Immediately after
the bath, get into bed and cover with plenty of blankets, so profuse sweating can begin.
• Take a hot ginger chest compress.
• Use salt water nasal douche to open the sinuses.
• Apply a trunk pack. Apply a full cold trunk pack each evening. The objective is to
stimulate skin elimination and induce perspiration. Leave it on for at least 3 hours at night.
• Take a steam inhalation, using eucalyptus, pine needles, cloves, and/or thyme.
• Apply a cold compress to the neck, and leave it on for 1-3 hours or all night. It must
(must) dry out before morning, or the value has been lost. If it does not change into a
heating compress, it can increase the sore throat condition.
PREVENTION—Once contracted, a cold must run its course. So it is better, far better, to prevent it
than cure it. The best prevention is to live right, eat right, get enough out-of-door exercise to strengthen
the body, and get enough rest. Do not skimp on sleep at night, especially in the colder months. Do not
share food with someone who has a cold. Be sure and dress warmly enough when it is cold. Do not sit in
a draft. Do not go outside with a wet head.
Many people, who are especially susceptible to colds, never get them. They have learned to live above
the level where they contract such infections. Learn the distant early warning signs.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ died so you could be forgiven of your sins, and, by His grace, be
enabled to obey His revealed will, as written in the Ten Commandments. Some people obey this one,
and some obey that one. But God wants us to obey all ten precepts, as given in Exodus 20.

NOTE—Most of the following recommendations would also apply to coughs and flu.
SYMPTOMS—Colds are a general inflammation of the mucus membranes of the respiratory passages.
Symptoms include nose and throat irritations, watery eyes, fever, headaches, chills, muscle aches, and
temporary loss of smell and taste.
A heavy cold may take the form of acute or chronic infection, such as flu, grippe, tonsillitis, sinusitis,
bronchial catarrh, chronic cold, or similar virus-type infection.
Children who frequently have colds or flus may have thyroid malfunctions.
COLDS AND FLU—How can you tell whether it is a heavy cold—or the flu? Here is the difference:
Headache - prominent in flu, but rare in a cold.
Fever - frequent and sudden in flu; rare in a cold.
Fatigue - extreme in flu and can last 2-3 weeks; there is only mild fatigue with a cold.
General aches - common and often severe in flu; slight in a cold.
Runny nose - occasionally in flu; common with a cold.
Cough - common with flu and can become severe; only mild to moderate in a cold.
Sore throat - sometimes with flu; common with a cold.
—For more on flu, see ""Influenza.""
CAUSES—In one sense, the cause is a variety of viruses. But in another, the person has allowed himself
to become run-down so that the virus was able to take hold. Factors which lower the body's resistance to
virus infection are overexposure to cold, fatigue, recent or present infections, allergic reactions, and
inhalation of irritating dust or gas, overeating, wrong eating, and sugar or alcohol consumption.
The common cold is not an infection that leaps out and attacks an innocent passerby. It is not even a
disease. A cold is the cure of a pre-diseased condition. and the symptoms are attempts by the body to
reestablish normal conditions. The body is carrying out a ""spring cleaning.""
The cold virus can change size and shape, making it impossible to produce a suitable vaccine. There are
more than 100 different viruses which cause colds. Symptoms last for 7-14 days regardless of therapy.
The incubation period is very short (1-3 days), instead of the 10-21 days for most viruses. The cold
seems to suddenly appear. When you get a tingling nose and throat, nasal mucus, or scratchy throat; do
not wait for the coughing, weakness, and fever to begin! Go to bed."
disease-respiratory-coughs,Coughs,"TREATMENT
• Apply eucalyptus oil inhalations, 10 min. a day, will help.
• An excellent cough syrup is made by mixing equal parts lemon juice and honey, with a
little cayenne pepper tea. Take 1 tsp. when needed.
• Boil a quart of water; lower the fire as much as possible and add a half tsp. cayenne
pepper. Wait a few minutes, then wet a towel in the water, wring it out and wrap it around
the neck. Keep the water hot and change this fomentation every 3-4 min, doing this for a
half hour while feet are soaked in hot water.
• Helpful herbs include licorice, fig leaves, mullein, vervain, oregano, bay leaves, hyssop,
and thyme. Take 3 cups a day (1 tsp. granulated herbs per cup boiling water. Never boil
the herbs. Never use aluminum ware).
• Mix thick flaxseed tea with 1-2 drops eucalyptus oil, and drink slowly.
• Add a tsp. salt to a pint of soft, warm water; snuff it up the nose, then blow it out gently.
Repeat till the nose is entirely clean of mucus. Then gargle the throat and rinse the mouth
out thoroughly with similar salt water.
• Whenever there is a cold, keep the nose and mouth clean. This will tend to keep the cold
from going down into the lungs.
• Cleanse the colon with high enemas. Continue until they reach the upper part, where the
transverse colon is.
• If there is any nausea or bad feeling in the stomach, take an emetic to vomit it out.
Lukewarm water, or water with a little salt in it will generally help do this. Drink all the
water possible, and then run the finger down the throat. Repeat till the stomach is clean.
Then drink a few cups of a hot herb tea (such as sage, hyssop, yarrow, black cohosh,
peppermint, or chamomile). Later in the day, drink some more.
• Keep quiet and stay in bed. Take only fruit juices (or lemon juice in hot water). Later
drink the broth of thick white potato peeling soup (also called potassium broth).
HYDRO—The following suggestions are from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order
sheet) (pp. 181, 208, 217, 246):
Heating Chest pack, to be changed every 6 hours. If temperature is elevated, change chest pack every 2-
4 hours. Copious water drinking, 2-3 pints daily.
Fomentation to spine; sipping hot water; Chest Pack. Cold Compress to the throat; gargling hot water
several times daily; Steam Inhalation 15 min. every hour, sipping half a glass of hot water when inclined
to cough.
For irritable cough, without expectoration: Sipping very hot water; gargle hot water; Steam Inhalations;
avoid mouth breathing; keep air of room warm (75-80o F.), and moist with steam; carefully avoid
exposure of back of neck, chest, or shoulders to drafts, or to chill by evaporation during treatment.
For cough with viscid expectoration: Copious hot water drinking; fluid diet; Fomentation to chest every
2 hours, followed by Heating Compress.
For painful cough: Fomentation to chest every 2 hours; tight bandage about chest to restrain movement
if necessary; Revulsive Compress for 15 min. every 2 hours or often as needed. Dry cotton Chest Pack
between applications.
For ineffective cough: Increase expulsive power by rubbing, or percussion of the chest with the hand
dipped in ice water, or slapping the chest with a cold, wet towel.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ knows every temptation that comes to man, and the capabilities of each
human agent. He can help you overcome and obey His Ten Commandment law. He died to take away
your sins, and give you strength to live right.

SYMPTOMS—Frequent coughing, either productive (producing phlegm) or not.
CAUSES—Coughs often accompany colds and other infections, and are a reflex action to clear the
airways of mucus, foreign bodies, an irritant, or some type of blockage.
A bronchial cough is tight and painful. A sinus infection generally drips mucus down the throat,
producing a cough.
Croupy coughs produce a loud raspy sound, bringing up phlegm with difficulty. A few drops of lobelia
herb under the tongue every few minutes will relax the cough muscles and may loosen the mucus. Be
sure and drink enough water and other liquids, so the mucus does not become thick.
Damage to the lung tissues, caused by pneumonia, can result in a chronic cough.
While on the subject of coughs, there are two other kinds of cough:
Lung cancer or tumors can produce a mild cough, which gradually becomes worse, possibly
accompanied by blood.
Then there is smoker's cough. Lung cancer may follow, unless the tobacco is thrown away.
If there is any suspicion of tuberculosis, read that article."
disease-respiratory-cold-sores,Cold Sores,"TREATMENT
• Trust in God and stop worrying about so many things. Eat better, take time to walk
outside, and get enough sleep at night.
• Eat plenty of raw vegetables.
• Apply ice for 15-20 minutes at the first sign of tingling. If possible, repeat it frequently.
Apply vitamin E between applications. Get enough vitamin A (50,000 units) and B
complex. Zinc is also important (zinc gluconate lozenges); dissolve in mouth every 3
hours for 2 days or take 25-50 mg daily. Daily take 2,000-3,000 mg of the amino acid
lysine till the cold sore is gone. Protect your lips from sunburn and wind. Exercise plus
adequate rest bolsters the immune system, so it can better resist cold sores.
• Also helpful is goldenseal, echinacea, red clover, and pau d'arco.
• If it is not bothering you very much, leaving a cold sore alone is a good idea.
—Also see ""Canker Sores.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—We can only see a little way before us, but God sees everything. He knows all
about our needs, and He cares for us. He sits above the confusion and distractions of the earth, and all
things are opened to His divine survey. From His great and calm eternity, He orders that which His
providence sees is best.

(Fever Blisters)
SYMPTOMS—These are thin-walled inflamed pimples which have a tendency to recur in the same
area, most frequently at the borders of the mouth, but sometimes on the gums or conjunctiva (the lining
of the inner surface of the eyelid). It tends to occur at, or close to, where the skin and mucous membrane
meet. First comes a local tenderness with a small bump. Then this bump changes into a blister, and the
tenderness may increase. Nearby lymph nodes may become swollen. After about 48 hours, the blisters
crust over. Sometimes pus oozes, making eating difficult. Cold sores appear 3-10 days after exposure
and may last up to 3 weeks, but generally only 7-10 days.
CAUSE—This is an infectious disease caused by herpes simplex (herpes simplex virus I; Herpes virus
hominis). But, for practical purposes, there are other causes as well:
Some people never have cold sores, and others have them frequently. Stress is a significant cause. Eating
too much sugar is another. Excess ultraviolet light or acid foods cause them in some people. For some
women, the onset of menstruation can be a cause. Alcoholic drinking and poor diet also bring them on.
Local irritation can be an incipient factor. For some, cold sores tend to occur with a fever, infection, or
cold, after exposure to the sun and wind, or when the immune system is depressed.
If cold sores occur frequently, the problem may be low thyroid function.
Cold sores seem somewhat like canker sores (which see), but they are different in several ways. They
form blisters, but canker sores do not. They can form anywhere on the body, although especially on the
mouth area or on the genitals. Whereas we are not certain of the bacterial or viral origins of canker sores,
cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus I."
disease-respiratory-cold-extremities,Cold Extremities,"SYMPTOMS—Hands and feet frequently, or always, feeling cold.
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• Are you dressing warmly enough? Fashionable clothing often dictates leaving the arms
and legs improperly clad. The blood supply is chilled back from the extremities and
pooled in the trunk. This breakdown in proper body circulation can produce diseased
conditions in the chest, as well as the intestinal and abdominal organs.
• Are your nerves being fed properly? Get adequate B complex vitamins, including niacin
and B Also take RNA (ribonucleic acid).
2.
• You may have a sluggish thyroid (hypothyroidism).
• If sudden coldness comes to your hands and/or feet, and they blanch white, you may
have Raynaud's disease (which see).
ENCOURAGEMENT—The heart in which Jesus makes His abode will be quickened, purified, guided,
and ruled by the Holy Spirit; and the soul will be enabled to overcome those sins which he could never
put away by himself. Thank God for His enabling grace."
disease-respiratory-cold-feet,Cold Feet,"TREATMENT
• Put the feet in cold water for 1 minute, dry them, then jump rope, run, or walk for 1-2
minutes. Do this 3-4 times a day.
• If you have a lawn by your house, walk barefoot for a few minutes on the cool, wet lawn
when you arise. Then quickly dry the feet, put on fresh socks, then your shoes, and keep
active until the feet thoroughly warm. When you do this, forget about the neighbors; you
are having more fun than they are. Perhaps they will start doing it too. Better yet, move to
the country.
ENCOURAGEMENT—The pure in heart will see God; and it is only God that can, by grace, enable us
to choose to be pure. By faith, we walk and talk with our Redeemer, and live His life.

SYMPTOMS—Feet which seem cold too much of the time.
CAUSES—This might be caused by some deeper problem, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, Raynaud's
disease, Buerger's disease, etc. (which see)."
disease-respiratory-bronchiectasis,Bronchiectasis,"TREATMENT
• Determine to cough slowly by first breathing slowly and deeply, then hold the breath for
several seconds. Then give two short, forceful coughs with the mouth open. The first
loosens the phlegm; the second brings it up. Hold the breath again and then breathe in
slowly, to avoid non-productive coughing.
• Do not use cough medicines and antihistamines. They dry up the secretions, making
them even harder to expel.
• Drink lots of fluids, so the phlegm will be thinner and looser.
• Use a cool-air vaporizer each night. Try to maintain 30-50% humidity in the house
during the day.
• Do not wear belts; the abdomen should be free to breathe and cough properly.
• In cold weather, wear a scarf or mask over the mouth and nose, to warm the air.
—See ""Bronchitis"" for much more.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We are strangers and pilgrims in this world. We are to wait, watch, pray, and
work. There are souls all around us who desperately need God. You can help them come to Him.
Section 7
Respiratory
Part 3
Lungs

SYMPTOMS—Chronic cough with sputum. He may cough up blood or bloodstained sputum and have
inflammation of the lungs. In advanced cases, there may be shortness of breath when any exertion is
made.
CAUSES—Bronchiectasis is permanent dilation and infection of one or more bronchi.
Causes can include obstructions in the bronchi, lung infections, breathing in of foreign substances or
vomitus, enlarged lymph nodes, pressure tumors, or dilated blood vessels."
disease-respiratory-pneumonia,Pneumonia,"TREATMENT
• You will want to use essentially the same treatment as outlined for bronchitis; except
that, because the person's illness is so much more serious, he must be given much rest and
intensified care.
• Rinse out the nose with saltwater, gently taking it in and blowing it out. Gargle with
saltwater. Then repeat the rinsing and gargling with a goldenseal and myrrh mixture. This
will help keep a cold or flu from going down into the lungs.
• But if the lungs are already affected, do the above treatment. Also give hot footbaths and
a high herb enema at least once a day. Drink plenty of water. Take laxative herbs, to keep
the bowels working properly. Give short, hot fomentations to the chest and upper back,
with short cold between each hot application.
• Only give liquids the first few days. These should consist of fruit juices (diluted
pineapple juice or orange juice) or lemon and water (without sugar), etc. Continue this
until the high fever abates. Then give strained vegetable broths, whole grains (best in dry
form, so it will be chewed well).
—Also see ""Lung Congestion,"" ""Bronchio-pneumonia,"" and ""Lobar Pneumonia."" Also see ""Bronchitis""
and ""Pleurisy.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—It is essential that every child of God obey His law. He never asks that you
obey in your own strength. But, in Christ, you can be an overcomer, resisting all the wiles of the devil.

(Lung Fever)
SYMPTOMS—Fever, chills, aching muscles, coughing, sore throat, bloody sputum, enlarged lymph
nodes in the neck, pain in the chest, rapid, difficult breathing, and cyanosis (bluish skin and nails from
lack of oxygen).
In bacterial pneumonia, it comes suddenly and the cough is dry at first; then a rust-colored sputum is
produced, and breathing becomes rapid and labored. The viral form is more variable in seriousness,
from the time it begins.
CAUSES—Pneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs and bronchial tubes. It can be caused by
bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa. The tiny sacs in the lungs (which look somewhat like grapes
hanging from their stems) are where the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange is made. These sacs
become inflamed and filled with mucous and pus.
Generally an upper respiratory infection (in the throat and the bronchial tubes), such as a cold, the flu, or
perhaps the measles, occurs. Those under one year or over 60 are the most susceptible.
Bacterial pneumonia is more dangerous and severe than the viral type. There is also a fungal pneumonia,
but those with HIV are most likely to contract it.
In children, the pain of pneumonia is frequently located in the abdomen, and cause others to think there
is acute indigestion or appendicitis."
disease-respiratory-broncho-pneumonia,Broncho-Pneumonia,"(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL MEASURES—See ""Pneumonia, Lobar.""
BRONCHIAL IRRITATION—Steam Inhalation, 15 minutes every hour; Fomentation to chest every 2
hours for 15 minutes, followed by Heating Compress; Hot Blanket Pack.
CYANOSIS—Short Hot Half Bath; pour Cold water over head, spine, and chest, to induce cough, if
cough is checked or inefficient while secretion is abundant. It is well to have him sit in a tub with a
small amount of hot water while a Cold Pail Pour is given, followed by vigorous rubbing and wrapping
in dry blankets in bed.
AFTER CONVALESCENCE BEGINS—Heating Chest Pack night and day. Graduated cold
applications, to build up general resistance.
—Also see ""Pneumonia."""
disease-respiratory-lobar-pneumonia,Lobar Pneumonia,"TREATMENT
• The treatment is obviously a matter of retracing one's steps—and doing what he should
have done earlier.
• Initially, he must overcome the critical phase of the disease with fasting, rest, and good
food, all the while having fresh air in his room.
• But later, he must take time each day to do something out-of-doors (such as walk up a
hill) that will exercise, not only his body, but his lungs.
• Keep in mind that the tubercle bacillus remains with you; it is believed that you will
have the seeds of it in your lungs for the remainder of your lifetime. So once you are on
your feet again and appear to be well, you must continue a program of careful eating,
living, outdoor activity; all the while obtaining adequate rest every night.
• At the present time, TB is making a powerful comeback—and is once again becoming a
modern plague. So be careful. It may be in the air of the next building you enter. Live
right every day.
—Follow the cleansing and healing program given in ""Bronchitis,"" and ""Pneumonia."" Also see
""Pleurisy.""
—Also see ""Tuberculosis—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Day by day we are to live for God. Day by day, we are to help those around
us. As we do this, angels work with us, and what a joy is ours!

disease, is to build up his vital resistance by carefully graduated cold applications (the various Tonic
Frictions), repeated 2-3 times a day. The intensity of the application should be steadily increased from
day to day in order to secure good results. No one is too feeble to receive water therapy of some sort;
and, by careful graduation, persons of feeble physique, but in whom the disease is not yet far advanced,
may be trained to receive very vigorous cold applications with excellent effects. In making the cold
applications, care must be taken to avoid chilling him; for this would immediately aggravate his cough.

(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL—Exercise special care, to prevent lung congestion due to exposure of shoulders or chest to
chill by evaporation. Provide him with an abundance of pure warm air; have a supply of oxygen at hand
for immediate use if required.
MAINTAIN GENERAL VITAL RESISTANCE—Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub 2-4 times
daily, after some appropriate heating procedure, as a Fomentation to chest or back, Hot Blanket Pack, or
Sweating Wet Sheet Pack.
COMBAT LOCAL CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS AND INVASION OF THE SPECIFIC
BACILLUS—Fomentation to the chest (both front and back) for 15 minutes every 3 hours. During the
interval between, apply Cold Compress at 600 F., changing every 15 minutes or as soon as warmed.
Lengthen the period between fomentations and change the compress less frequently as the temperature is
lowered, the pain less, and the stage of the disease more advanced. Several Ice Bags may be used in
place of the Cold Compress, but the bags should be removed at least every half hour and the chest
should be rubbed until red and warm, to maintain surface circulation and skin reflexes. The skin must be
kept warm.
ELIMINATION OF POISONS—Sweating Wet Sheet Packs, continued for 2-4 hours, followed by
Cold Mitten Friction, carefully administered. The Sweating Bath may be preceded by the short Full Hot
Bath. Copious water drinking. Neutral enema twice daily.
COUGH—Fomentations every 3 hours; Heating Compress, changing every 15-30 minutes during the
interval in between. Steam Inhalation 15 minutes, every hour; sipping half a glass of hot water when
inclined to cough; careful protection of neck and shoulders from chilling by contact with wet bed
clothing. Keep shoulders covered.
PAIN IN CHEST—Revulsive Compress covering the whole chest before and behind.
EXUDATION (ELIMINATION) OF PHLEGM—Alternate Compresses for 20 minutes 3 times a
day, with continuous well-protected Heating Compress during the intervals in between and after
convalescence begins; for unresolved exudation, Alternate Fan Douche or Alternate Spray.
CONSTIPATION—Daily Cold Enema or Cold Colonic.
DIARRHEA—Enema at 960F. after each bowel movement; Cold Abdominal Bandage, renewing every
half hour; Fomentation every 2-4 hours, if pain or tenderness is present.
TYMPANITES (gaseous distension of abdomen)—Hot Enema followed by small Cool Enema; Cold
Colonic; Cold Abdominal Compress, changing hourly.
GASTRO-DUODENITIS—Fomentation over stomach and bowels or Hot Trunk Pack every 3 hours.
During intervals in between, Cold Compress at 600F., changing every 30 minutes; Neutral Enema daily.
JAUNDICE—Large Hot Colonic at 1050F., followed by small Cold Enema twice daily. Fomentation
over the liver and stomach every 2 hours. During the interval in between, Heating Compress, changing
every 30 minutes.
WEAK HEART, FEEBLE PULSE—Cold Compress or Ice Bag over the heart for 15 minutes every 2
hours. Cold Mitten Friction every 2 hours. Prolonged Neutral Bath with Ice Bag over heart, Cold Pail
Pour to back of head and upper spine at the end of the bath.
CYANOSIS (BLUENESS)—Hot Blanket Pack for 15 minutes, followed by Cold Mitten Friction.
Avoid exposure of the body to chill by evaporation.
HEADACHE—Ice Compress to head, or Ice Cap; Hot Pack to legs and hips, or other derivative
treatment; Hot and Cold Head Compress [Simultaneous Hot and Cold to the Head].
NOSEBLEED—Ice Bag to back of neck, short hot Fomentations to face.
DELIRIUM—Heating Wet Sheet Pack, Ice Cap to Head, Prolonged Sweating Wet Sheet Pack.
INSOMNIA—Neutral Wet Sheet Pack.
CEREBRAL CONGESTION—Hip and Leg Pack, Ice Cap to head.
FEVER—Prolonged Neutral Bath, Wet Sheet Pack, Cooling Enema.
SUBNORMAL TEMPERATURE—Dry Pack, Hot Blanket
Pack, Hot Enema, and hot water drinking. Do not expose him during changing of application or after it.
PAIN IN ABDOMEN AND BACK—Hot Blanket Pack or large Fomentations over affected parts,
followed by Heating Compress.
CAPILLARY BRONCHITIS—Hot Blanket Pack followed by Sweating Wet Sheet Pack. Hot Enemas
followed by Cold Friction, carefully given. Fomentation to the chest followed by Heating Compress or
Chest Pack, to remain in place an hour or until thoroughly warmed. Repeat bath when temperature rises
to 1020F.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Do not use Cold Full Baths or anything equivalent.
GENERAL METHOD—Maintain warmth and activity of the skin, taking special care to avoid chilling
of the shoulders, which should be especially protected by a wrapping, closely applied. Combat
pulmonary congestion by local applications made as directed above. Keep the temperature down by
carefully managed hydrotherapy measures such as the Heating Pack, the Hot Blanket Pack, followed by
Cold Mitten Friction and like measures rather than Cold Full Baths and Cooling Packs, which aggravate
lung congestion by producing retrostasis. Promote vital resistance by frequently repeated partial Cold
Frictions, and thus sustain the vital powers until opportunity has been afforded for the development of
antitoxins and the suppression of the disease by the natural healing processes.

TUBERCULOSIS—1
(Consumption)
SYMPTOMS—Coughing, general fatigue, loss of appetite, chest pain, night sweats, and low-grade
fever. The cough is at first not too productive, but later increasing amounts of phlegm are coughed up.
The person loses weight and the sputum becomes bloody.
CAUSES—In the 19th century, tuberculosis (TB) was called consumption, for the person seemed to
waste away. It is caused by a highly contagious bacteria, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although it
generally affects the lungs, it can attack any part of the body: kidneys, bones, skin, intestines, spleen,
and liver.
In adults, pleurisy is frequently a complication of tuberculosis. The sharp chest pain one may feel might
be the pleurisy (which see)
It is spread by coughing. Tiny droplets are inhaled by others. The germ enters the lungs and remains
there. As long as the person maintains a healthy lifestyle, the body encapsulates the germs; that is, a tiny
calcium shell is placed around the TB germ, to render it harmless.
If the person continues to eat right, get enough calcium in his diet, obtain adequate rest, exercise out-of-
doors, and breathe vigorously to keep his lungs in good health—he will not develop TB, even though the
germs are in his lungs."
disease-respiratory-fluoride-poisoning,Fluoride Poisoning,"SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE—Mottled, discolored teeth. This is a permanent change which cannot be
reversed.
THE PROBLEM—Dentists prescribe fluoride substances for teeth; fluoride, a trace mineral, is added
to most city water in excessively large amounts. The objective is to reduce dental caries (tooth decay);
but a much smaller amount does this, and only in small children. Fluoride never helps the teeth of adults.
(The true cause of dental caries is eating sugar, candies, refined carbohydrates, soda beverages, and too
little of fruits and vegetables.)
There was an 85% increase of cancer in Manchester, England, after the introduction of fluoride. Down's
syndrome increased in U.S. cities when fluoridated water supplies began. Japanese researchers found
that children with mottled teeth had a higher incidence of heart disease.
Fluoride combines with calcium to make an insoluble calcium, producing bone deformities.
Fluoride destroys iodine, thus causing thyroid problems.
SOLUTIONS—Read labels and use nothing containing fluoride. Avoid fluoride sources and
environments. Only drink distilled water. Drink plenty of fruit and vegetable juices.
—For additional information, see ""Chemical Poisoning.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—In Christ is light and peace and joy forevermore. The longer we live with
Christ, the closer we draw to heaven. Let nothing separate you from His side."
disease-skin-boils,Boils,"TREATMENT
• Go on a brief cleansing fast, to rid the system of impurities. The problem may be toxins,
but it may be chemical poisoning. One example would be sulphur. Whenever it is taken
into the body, it tries to leave—not through the bowels or kidneys—but through the skin.
• While on this liquid fast for a couple days, you may drink 3 cups of an herb tea daily of
one or more of the following: comfrey, red clover blossoms, yellow dock root, chickweed,
plantain, and wild cherry bark.
• Every night apply a poultice of raw potato mixed with flaxseed. If you apply a poultice
during the day, use whole wheat flour and stiffened it with enough honey so it will not
run.
• Apply moist heat (a clean towel, cloth, or gauze that is wet in warm water) 3-4 times
daily to the boil. This will reduce pain and help bring it to a head more quickly. Avoid
irritating the area or spreading the pus. Avoid exercise which might cause sweating until it
heals.
• Keep the skin clean by washing it several times a day. Place honey directly over the boil.
Alternates would be clay, charcoal, and/or chlorophyll.
• Apply vitamin E oil to the area.
• Some boils are large and persistent. Some type of poison in the body is trying to get out.
Bed rest, a short fast, followed by a light, nutritious diet will greatly help.
• Helpful herbal teas include oat straw, goldenseal, dandelion, and burdock root.
—Also see ""Abscesses.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—If we were left to ourselves, we would make mistakes. But we can go to God,
our kind Father in heaven, and receive all the help in time of need.

(Furuncles; Carbuncles)
SYMPTOMS—Itching, mild pain, and local swelling, often on the scalp, buttocks, face, or underarms.
Within 24 hours, the boil becomes red and filled with pus. Fever and swelling of the lymph glands
nearest the boil may occur. Boils are tender, red, painful, and appear suddenly.
CAUSES—Boils are small pus-filled bumps. The medical name for them is furuncles.
Carbuncles are many-headed boils which tend to combine and enlarge. They begin as a painful,
localized infection, producing pus-filled areas in the deeper layers of the skin. Carbuncles are slower
healing than boils. They are both treated alike.
Boils are contagious. Do not let the draining pus get on the skin elsewhere! When it spreads to nearby
areas, the result is a carbuncle.
Untreated boils tend to exude their poisons and disappear within 10-24 days. But, given careful
treatment, they are contained and less severe.
Keep in mind that if the body is trying to expel a poison (especially sulphur!) through the skin, you may
continue to have a string of boils for a time. The body is trying to cleanse itself of something bad.
Inorganic sulphur in the body is especially prone to come out in skin boils."
disease-skin-burns,Burns,"TREATMENT
• First degree: Mix equal parts of white vinegar with water and cover the burn surface,
twice a day. Also apply aloe vera or vitamin E oil locally. Tannic acid has been used in
clinics for surface burns that have begun to heal, so you can use white oak bark tea. Apply
locally as a tea and wet compress.
• Second degree: Apply vitamin E oil or zinc oxide. Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance.
Apply aloe vera after healing begins.
• Third and fourth degree: Immediately take the person to a professional. Do not try to
remove clothing stuck to the burned area. Apply aloe vera after healing has begun.
• Soak the clothes, so the hot cloth will not increase the burn. Apply cold until the pain
subsides.
• Cold water or cold, wet cloths on the area reduce pain and swelling. Cover the burn, to
reduce likelihood of infection. Mix and apply olive oil with baking soda to the area.
Elevate the area, to reduce swelling, and keep it out of the sun. Do not break the blisters,
and never put salves or butter on burns. Watch for indications of infection, odor, pus, or
angry redness. Cold clay poultices are useful.
• Second degree, on up, requires a high protein diet and 5,000 calories per day. Increase
fluid intake. Also important: vitamins A, B, C, E, and F.
• Applying vitamin E and spraying on a 1-3% solution of vitamin C every 2-4 hours is
very helpful. This reduces pain and accelerates healing. Take 1,000 mg of vitamin C
orally, every hour.
• Have the patient breathe deeply every so often. He needs the vital oxygen for healing of
the burn.
• Fresh aloe vera juice is outstanding on burns, to hasten healing. But this can only be
done if you have a growing plant to cut the leaves from.
HYDRO—The following hydrotherapy treatments are listed in the author's book, Water Therapy
Manual (see order sheet): Ice Pack (p. 46), Neutral Full Bath (p. 122), Evaporating Compress, and the
Cool Irrigating Compress (p. 242). Extensive burns can be treated with the Prolonged or Continuous
Neutral Bath (p. 242, 122). Old burns can be treated with the Paraffin Bath (p. 79).
ENCOURAGEMENT—He that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. He is kept in perfect peace
whose mind is stayed on God. By His enabling grace, you may obey all His will for your life.

(Scalds)
SYMPTOMS—There are first degree burns (redness), second degree burns (redness and blisters), and
third degree burns (the entire skin and some of the underlying muscle is destroyed). For third degree
burns, immediately go to a doctor or an emergency room. Even more extreme is a fourth degree burn:
Instead of oozing flesh, the area is dry and charred.
CAUSES—Tissue damage to the skin as a result of heat, chemical, electrical, or radiation injury. First
degree: usually from sun or water; second degree: generally from hot metal objects, flame-contact burns
and severe sunburn; third: hot fluid burns, steam from a pressure cooker, electrical burns, or high flame
contact."
disease-skin-acne,Acne,"TREATMENT
• Cleanliness is important. Keep the skin washed and clean. Keep the infected area free of
all oils. Wash or pat the face with lemon juice 3 times a day. Shampoo the hair frequently.
Eat a good, balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get adequate sleep at night. Drop all
saturated fats from the diet, along with junk food, fried food, refined food, dairy foods,
carbonated drinks, caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco.
• Certain dietary deficiencies have been linked to acne. This includes vitamin B6, zinc,
and essential fatty acids.
• Increase raw vegetable intake. Eat plenty of non-citrus fruits, raw vegetable juice,
cooked vegetables, salads, whole grains, and a few seeds and nuts. Include some seaweed
(for iodine) and pumpkin seed (for zinc).
• Go on a short vegetable juice fast of 1-3 days, along with enemas. It would be well to do
this every 2 to 4 weeks, until the skin is perfectly clear.
• Beware of all oily foods which have saturated fats. This would include peanut butter,
cheese, milk, and cream. A small amount of unsaturated vegetable oil would be
acceptable.
• Herbs which could be applied to the skin would include dandelion root, echinacea,
alfalfa, chaparral, and red clover.
ENCOURAGEMENT—At times it will seem that you cannot take another step. Well, wait and know
that ""I am God,"" He tells you. ""Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed,
for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."" Trust Him and, by His enabling grace, obey
His Ten Commandment law.

SYMPTOMS—Blackheads, whiteheads, pustules, inflamed and infected nodules, sacs, and cysts. They
occur where the sebaceous (oil) glands are most numerous: face, neck, chest, and back. Permanently
expanded pores, as well as scarring, can result.
CAUSES—A sebaceous gland is located in every hair follicle, and produces oil which lubricates the
skin. Some of the oil becomes clogged, bacteria multiply, and inflammation results. This occurs during
adolescence (between 12 and 24), when androgens (male hormones) are released in increased amounts
in both boys and girls. A few have acne all their lives.
Other causes include junk foods, oral contraceptives, allergies, stress, and heredity.
The problem is intensified when sebum, combined with skin pigments, plugs the pores—and produces
blackheads. If scales below the surface fill with sebum, whiteheads are formed.
Canadian Eskimos, prior to 1950, never had acne. When ""modern foods"" were brought in, acne became
common."
disease-skin-warts,Warts,"TREATMENT
• Since everyone seems to get better using a different treatment, here are lots of them:
• As with any infection, warts appeared because the body has lowered vitality and lack of
resistance. Eat right, keep proper hours, exercise in the open air, and breath deep. Tone up
your whole body.
• They also appear more frequently in adolescents who are experiencing hormonal
changes, especially between 12 and 16.
• Deficiencies of vitamins A, C, and zinc have all been related to an increased incidence of
viral infections.
• The usual methods of removing warts (surgery, acids, burning, electrotherapy, or
freezing) often results in their reappearance. The underlying causes should be eliminated:
Improve the diet; eat foods high in vitamins A, B complex, C, and zinc. Also increase the
sulfur-containing amino acids in the diet, such as are found in asparagus, citrus fruits,
eggs, garlic, and onions. Be sure and take enough vitamin C every day! Eat raw garlic.
• Place thin sections of garlic on the wart. Try to avoid touching the garlic to normal
tissue. Hold it in place with cloth and tape and leave it there overnight. Do this for 2 or 3
nights. Within a week the wart will fall off.
• Apply castor oil to the wart, for 3 weeks.
• Cover with honey, for 15 days.
• Put 1 drop muriatic acid on the wart once a day, for 8 days.
• Dissolve as much sodium carbonate (washing soda) in water as will stay in solution.
Swab this onto the warts for 2 minutes, 4 times a day, and let it dry in the air. Very large
warts have responded to this.
• Apply the juice of milkweed, celandine herb, or the milk from green figs or marigold to
the wart.
• Mix castor oil and baking soda into a paste and apply to wart, cover, and keep on all
night. Do not pick at it, but let it slough off within 3-6 weeks.
• Apply an iron formula, such as Ironite or black walnut tincture.
• Apply castor oil to the wart for half an hour, 3 times a day.
• Apply powdered vitamin C, as paste, and cover.
• Soak the wart in a concentrated salt water solution: 1½ tsp. salt to ½ cup water equals a
30% solution. Soak the wart for 20 minutes 2-3 times a day for a few weeks.
• Here are several other helpful applications: green fig juice; that is, juice from barely ripe
figs (or milkweed sap) applied several times a day. Fresh grated celandine juice. Cut a raw
potato, rub it on, and repeat several times a day for several weeks. Chickweed juice.
Sassafras oil. Green papaya juice. Aloe vera. Onion and salt compress. The juice of white
cabbage. Wheat germ oil. Fresh pineapple juice. Cashew nut.
• For plantar warts (warts on the bottom of your foot), apply a plantain poultice (the leaf
itself) to the wart. Another method is to place the inner side of a fresh piece of banana skin
over the wart and hold it there with tape. Change daily after washing the entire area. Once
a week the thickened outer horny layer is removed. Maximum time for complete
disappearance of a wart is 6 weeks, with no recurrence within 2 years.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Do your duty and trust in God, for He knows of what things you have need.
He watches over you with more tenderness than does a mother over an afflicted child.

(Papillomas)
SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—There are three primary types of skin warts:
1 - Contagious (viral) benign skin warts (verruca vulgaris); these are also called common warts and may
be found on the hands, arms, face, or body. These warts, which can be dark or flesh-colored, may range
in size from a pinhead to a bean, and most frequently occur where the skin is in friction with clothing,
etc. They can also occur on the larynx (voice box) and produce hoarseness. They can be spread by
picking, trimming, or touching them. On the face, they can be spread by shaving.
2 - Plantar warts are verruca on the sole of the foot. Both types of verruca are actually benign epithelial
tumors, caused by a virus.
3 - Venereal warts (condylomata acuminata) may be found on the vulva and penis. Venereal warts are
caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), of which there are more than 35 types. Genital warts on a
woman can change into cancer of the cervix or genital area. They should be removed! One study showed
they can increase the risk of cervical cancer by 200 percent! The incubation period for genital warts is
generally 3 months. It can spread to others even before the person realizes he or she has it. Professionals
recommend that you not have sexual intercourse until these types of warts are eliminated.
With the exception of plantar warts which are flat, warts are always raised bumps. Where there is
constant contact, they can cause discomfort and even pain. Venereal (genital) warts are single or clusters
of soft cauliflower-like growths."
disease-skin-heat-rash,Heat Rash,"TREATMENT
• Take a soda alkaline bath. This helps counteract acidity in the rash. Fill a bathtub with
water at 95o-98o F. Add a cup of baking soda. Sit in the tub and continually pour the water
over yourself. About 30-60 minutes later, stand in the tub and partially drip-dry. Then pat
yourself dry and get out.
• Eat a more nutritious diet, obtain adequate rest, avoid meat and junk food. Do not smoke
or drink liquor.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God loves His children, and He longs to see them overcoming the
discouragement with which Satan would overpower them. Do not give way to unbelief. Remember the
love and power that God has shown in times past.

SYMPTOMS—An itchy skin rash which can occur in the heat of mid-summer.
CAUSES—As a result of poor diet, overwork, and lack of proper rest, the skin has become too acid."
disease-skin-sunburn,Sunburn,"TREATMENT
• A third degree sunburn is serious; see a doctor. Water applications help. Keep the
muscles flexible. A strong sunburn can cause underlying muscles to contract somewhat.
• For both second and third degree burns, be sure to eat high-protein foods. A lot of tissue
needs to be repaired; your body is hard at work. Drink a lot of fluids.
• Put cold water on the burn. Let him lay in a cool bath.
• Mix a cup of skim milk with 4 cups water and add a few ice cubes; every few hours,
apply compresses for 15-20 minutes.
• Place dry oatmeal in a bag, run cool water through it, and save the water. Throw away
the contents of the bag, and use the water in compresses. Apply every 2-4 hours.
• Here are other suggestions: Clay poultices can be used. Massage aloe vera on the area.
Do not apply any product which has alcohol, mineral oil, coloring, or waxes in it. Moisten
a cloth with witch hazel, and apply often for temporary relief; for small areas, apply with
cotton balls. Apply plain yogurt to the area. Make a paste of cornstarch and water, and
apply it. An ice pack can help reduce pain. Get lots of sleep.
• If the legs are burned, elevate them above the heart level.
• That skin area will be delicate for 3-6 months, so be careful.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God helps the feeble and strengthens those who have no strength. The Lord is
thy shade upon the right hand and upon the left. Trusting in Him, you will be safe.

SYMPTOMS—First degree sunburns cause reddening of the skin and possibly slight fever. Second
degree sunburns makes reddening and water blisters. Third degree sunburns produces damage to lower
cells and the release of fluid, resulting in eruptions and skin breaks where bacteria and infection can
enter.
CAUSES—There has been excessive exposure to ultraviolet light rays. They first burn the surface skin
and, later, the lower cell layers. Ultraviolet rays can penetrate clouds, so be careful even on hazy days.
PREVENTION—Do not expose yourself to the sun for extended periods of time between 10 a.m. and 2
p.m., when the highest concentration of ultraviolet rays are present. Reflections from snow water, metal,
sand, or white- and aluminum-painted surfaces can intensify the effect.
Apply a sunscreen about 30 minutes before going out. Protect your lips, hands, ears, and the back of the
neck. Reapply as needed after swimming and sweating. Get a tan gradually, beginning with only a few
minutes (never over 15). Wear protective clothing whenever possible. Keep a hat with you, and use it.
Long sleeves help."
disease-skin-skin-rash,Skin Rash,"TREATMENT
• Quick relief from many rashes may be obtained by soaking a clean cloth in cool water,
wringing it out, and applying it to the area for 10 minutes. Repeat as often as needed.
• Better yet, soak the cloth in comfrey tea or in calcium water. To make calcium water,
take a spoonful of calcium gluconate powder (obtainable at a health food store) and stir it
into a cup of water.
• A wash of chamomile tea helps reduce rashes. A poultice made from dandelion, yellow
dock root, and chaparral helps alleviate many of them.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When a soul receives Christ, he receives power to live the life of Christ. Just
as Christ resisted sin, so, in Christ's strength, you and I can resist temptation to wrongdoing.
Section 2
Skin
Part 7
Major Dermal Problems

SYMPTOMS—Reddening of various kinds on the skin, with possible bumps, scaling, and thickening.
CAUSES—In our modern world, skin rashes can have many causes, including reactions to chemicals,
sun, wind, insect bites, alcohol, detergents, and friction.
Skin rashes in children are often caused by food rashes from chocolate, peanuts, dairy products, wheat,
eggs, or meat. It has been estimated that 75% of children's skin rashes are caused by sensitivity to eggs,
peanuts, or milk."
disease-skin-eczema,Eczema,"(Dermatitis)
SYMPTOMS—Dermatitis, also called eczema, is a skin problem indicated by reddened skin,
thickening, itching when touched, the formation of dry, patchy scales, and flaking,
CAUSES AND TREATMENT—
• Dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that generally keeps reoccurring. Its
primary symptom is eczema. Dermatitis is actually an allergy which may be caused by
contact with perfumes, cosmetics, rubber, medicated creams and ointments, poison ivy, or
contact with metal alloys (including nickel, silver, and gold). Some type of food could be
the problem. If the irritant continues to be in constant contact with the skin, the dermatitis
will spread and get worse. Obviously, if you have this problem you want to solve it!
• The condition can be intensified by emotional stress and fatigue. Deficiency of any of
the B complex vitamins can cause dermatitis. Another important item is unsaturated fatty
acids. If you are not getting enough, you can begin itching wherever you rub on your skin.
Adequate vitamin A and enough protein are also essential.
• Oddly enough, hair loss (alopecia) is commonly associated with dermatitis, especially if
a concurrent unsaturated fatty acid deficiency in the diet exists.
• If the dermatitis is not terminated, it can so weaken the system, so that more serious
infections occur. This is because, at the same time that you are having skin problems, your
intestines are developing lesions which can greatly weaken your ability to digest and
absorb nutrients!
• It is a fact that 13% of those with severe dermatitis later develop cataracts.
• Here are some of the allergies which the experts have found to especially cause
dermatitis:
1 - Cow's milk. Either stop drinking cow's milk or try switching to goat's
milk.
2 - Wheat gluten (wheat protein). There are other grains you can eat instead.
3 - Nickel. The experts call this ""nickel rash."" Women who have their ears
pierced and the nickel post placed in them can produce various rashes on
the body—especially where any other metal jewelry touches the skin. By
the way, any gold jewelry less than 24-karats has some nickel in it.
• Beware of the bubble bath and similar soapy tub baths.
• Children's rashes: A skin rash in children may be caused by eating eggs, peanuts, milk,
wheat, fish, chicken, pork, or beef. Eggs, peanuts, and milk account for 75 percent of the
skin rashes in children.
• Regardless of what may be the cause, omit wheat, rye, oats, and barley for six weeks.
Then slowly add one back at a time—and see how all this effects the dermatitis.
• If you know how to do so, you may wish to do a pulse test after each meal, in an attempt
to ascertain which foods increase heart beat. Those which do are the problematic ones.
• Avoid dairy products, white flour, fried foods, other processed fats, and sugar. Avoid
antiperspirants, for they have metal in them. Use cotton undergarments. Fake fingernails
cause skin rashes. Always use white bathroom tissue only. The dyes irritate the skin. Be
sure and rinse the soap out of your clothes which have just been washed.
• Mix goldenseal root powder with vitamin E oil and put some on the affected area. This
will reduce the itching.
• Primrose oil and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) have helped infants with dermatitis.
• An oatmeal bath is another helpful measure, to reduce the itching during the time
required to solve the underlying cause. Use 2 cups of colloidal (powdered) oatmeal per
tubful. Colloidal oatmeal can be obtained at a pharmacy.
• Herbs that may help include comfrey, dandelion, red clover, and pau d'arco.
• Steep a tbsp. each of burdock root, yarrow, and yellow dock root in a pint of boiling
water for half an hour. Strain, add a pound of cocoa fat, and keep boiling and stirring until
it is a salve. Use this for eczema.
• Other useful herbs are plantain, chickweed, burdock root, yarrow, and strawberry leaves.
One can either drink the tea made from any of them or apply it to the affected area.
—Also see ""Drug Rash,"" ""Skin Disorders.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ, having redeemed man from the condemnation of the law, could enable
man to fulfill its requirements. Rejoice that, in Christ, you can stand an overcomer over the temptations
which have oppressed you."
disease-skin-psoriasis,Psoriasis,"TREATMENT
• There is no certainty that one can totally eliminate psoriasis. Do not spend time worrying
over the matter, for the resultant stress may only aggravate it.
• Only the scales and skin debris can be removed. Because psoriatic skin is dry, it is well
to put petroleum jelly or vegetable oil on the area. Researchers have found that covering
lesions with tape or plastic wrap for days or weeks can sometimes help clear it up. This
seems to work only for small areas, no larger than half a dollar. But do not let the area
become gooey and infected.
• Lose weight if you are overweight. Weight loss helps many who have psoriasis.
• Heavy stress can make it worse; try to retain a calm, cheerful outlook on life. Existing
psoriasis tends to get worse when you come down with some other infection.
• Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light reduces the scaling and redness. With regular
amounts of intense sunlight, 95% of psoriasis sufferers improve. But keep in mind that too
much ultraviolet light also produces skin cancer.
• You may wish to consider moving to a warmer climate, since the problem becomes
much worse in the winter.
• An increased intake of animal protein can make it spread outward; conversely, a
reduction tends to shrink it. Citrus juices may also be a problem.
• Since psoriasis is a metabolic disease, a cleansing juice fast, 2-3 times for the first week,
is a good way to begin working toward its recession. Four weeks later, the fast can be
carried out again. But in the meantime, an extremely nourishing diet should have been
started. All junk food should have been discarded. Search out, and eliminate, allergy
foods. Beware of milk and wheat. It may be well to exclude them for 6 months, even if
they may appear harmless.
• Avoid fats (butter, milk, cream, eggs, meat), processed food, white flour, sugar, and
citrus fruit. Red meat and dairy products contain arachidonic acid, which makes the
lesions turn red and swell. Get your oils from natural foods, such as flaxseed, sesame seed,
and soybeans.
• Vitamins A, B complex, C, and D all help the skin and appear to be of help in reducing
psoriasis.
• Swimming in the ocean is good for reducing psoriasis. Bathing in heated baths is also
helpful, but it also tends to increase the itching. Put seawater, several times a day, on the
area.
• The various medicinal drugs recommended for psoriasis all have potentially dangerous
side effects.
• To reduce the itching, a cold-water bath, perhaps with a cup or so of vinegar added, is
very helpful. Another help is ice. Put some in a plastic sack and hold on the area.

ENCOURAGEMENT—What greater privilege could be ours than to enter the family of God. Trust
God and, by the enabling grace of Christ, obey His Ten Commandment law, even though many around
you may despise it.
ERYSIPELAS—1
SYMPTOMS—Redness, discoloration, blisters, and swelling that most commonly attack the face and is
accompanied by high fever and other indications of acute illness. The skin is deep red or pink and
appears glazed. It has a combined itching and burning sensation. There is a definite edge or margin to
the affected area. Blisters may develop. The swollen area feels firm and hot. The condition tends to
spread in all directions from where it first began. Even in cases moderately severe, generally the face is
swollen; eyes are closed; and the lips and ears are thickened and feverish.
CAUSES—Erysipelas is serious; and, in babies, the aged, and women who have recently given birth, it
may prove fatal. It is likely to cause abortion in pregnant women. This is obviously a very serious
condition. You will want to contact a physician. If you have contacted a physician, apply ice bags or ice-
cold compresses (20 minutes on and 10 minutes off) to the affected area until he arrives. Cold
compresses to the head, to help reduce the headaches.
Erysipelas is contagious. Wear rubber gloves. Never simultaneously care for children or other sick
persons. Disinfect clothes placed on his skin. Soak 10 minutes in a Lysol solution (1 tbsp. per pint water)
before putting in laundry.
• Go on a thorough cleansing program, with fruit and vegetable juice fasting, followed by
a careful nutritious diet.
• In addition to the liquid diet, he must drink at least 3 quarts of water every day.
• Avoid constipation. When eating, there should be 3 movements a day, or use an enema.
• Do not wash with soap and water; only use a saturated solution of boric acid.
• Helpful herbs include plantain, yellow dock, chickweed, burdock root, chamomile,
mullein, and yarrow. Dissolve herbs in a quart of boiling water, dip a cloth in, cool, and
lightly touch the affected areas. Do not wipe the skin. Chickweed tea is excellent for this
purpose. Add 1 tbsp. per pint of boiling water.
• A raw cranberry poultice, applied cold, will help remove the burning. Dilute lemon juice
50-50 with water and apply gently.
• Cover the area with grated potatoes, about a fourth inch thick. When dry, remove, and do
it again.
—Also see ""Erysipelas—2,"" ""Skin Disorders.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—In the gift of Christ, God gave all heaven, that the moral image of God might
be restored in man. His enabling grace, in all its vastness, is offered to us—so that we might live clean,
good lives.
ERYSIPELAS—2
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
GENERAL—Cold Mitten Friction or Towel Rub every 3 hours.
COMBAT LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND EXTENSION OF THE DISEASE—Cold Compress
during the early stage of the disease, renewing before it becomes warm. Later, give it less frequently.
Avoid Ice Bags or Ice Compresses, which involve risk of sloughing. Fomentations for 2-5 minutes every
2 hours. Ice Collar when the skin of the head or face is affected.
FEVER—Graduated Bath, Prolonged Neutral Bath, Cooling Enema, Cooling Wet Sheet Pack.
RECURRING CHILLS—Dry Pack and hot water drinking.
VOMITING—Ice Bag over stomach, Hot and Cold Trunk Pack.
PERICARDITIS, ENDOCARDITIS—See ""Pericarditis and Endocarditis."" Fomentation over heart for
30 seconds, followed by Compress above heart at 600 F.; change every half hour.
ACUTE NEPHRITIS—See ""Acute Nephritis.""
GENERAL METHOD—During the early stage of the disease, while the surface is bright red and the
inflammation is extending, apply cooling measures, changing every few minutes (3-5 minutes), as often
as the fomentation is warm. Prevent extreme depression by a Fomentation that is not too hot, every hour
or two. When the parts become a dull red color or the rapid extension is checked, employ the Heating
Compress, changing it at intervals of 15-30 minutes, prolonging the interval as the fever and
inflammation subside.
If any of the following related problems exist, see under their respective headings: Myocarditis,
Arthritis, Acute Nephritis, Delirium.
—Also see ""Skin Disorders—1.""

SYMPTOMS—It appears like patches of silvery scales or red areas, and is found on the scalp, arms,
legs, knees, elbows, ears, and back. There are cycles of flare-ups and remission. Sometimes it disappears
for months or years, and especially occurs in winter months. In some, aging makes it better; in others,
worse. It is most common between 15 and 25, and is not infectious.
Do not use steroids, alcohol, or processed foods.
CAUSES—The skin cells seem to run out of control. Instead of skin renewing itself in 30 days, the new
cells reach the top layer in 3 days. This produces raised areas of skin, called plaques, which are red and
often itchy. Because so many cells are rising and dying (as they normally do), they have a raised,
silvery, patchy appearance.
Psoriasis may be linked to faulty fat utilization. Attacks are related to times of stress, illness, surgery,
cuts, certain viral and bacterial infections, sunburn, poison ivy, or poison oak. The drugs such as
chloroquine, lithium, and beta-blockers also cause it to flare up.
There appears to be a hereditary factor involved.
Previous immunizations seem to be a causative factor for some people."
disease-skin-frostbite,Frostbite,"TREATMENT
• Do not rub ice on the area! This only extracts more heat. Instead, get the person into a
warm tub (100o-110o F.) as soon as possible. The area is numb, so he will not feel the
heat. In the early stages, you can rub the area with a cloth dipped in cold water or snow.
• Do not apply more heat than mentioned above, for the skin is numb and can be burned
without anyone realizing it. Unless it is all you have, do not use dry, radiant heat (such as
a heat lamp or campfire). Frostbitten skin can easily burn, for it does not feel the heat.
• To warm the hands, place them under your armpits. Roll yourself into a ball to conserve
heat. Stay out of the wind. Do not get wet. Do not drink or smoke; both block circulation
to the extremities. If outside, stay in your car or truck until help comes.
• Living tissue is dying, so thaw the area quickly. Do not allow it to refreeze. Do not take
off your boots until it is safe to do so. The foot may be swollen and you might not get it
back on. If considerable walking must be done to find a place of safety, leave the feet
unthawed until you arrive at your destination.
• Move the person to a warmer place. Wrap him in blankets. Give him warm liquids, but
no alcohol. Alcohol gives an artificial feeling of warmth, but actually removes it.
CHILBLAINS—This is a lowering of the overall body temperature (not just in the extremities). But
because it so often centers in the extremities, we are including it in this section. The same treatment
should be applied.
The temperature is lowered to subnormal levels for some length of time, resulting in near frostbite.
Severe numbness and loss of function may occur if the problem is not dealt with. Colds, flu, and
infection can result.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Hide within your heart the precious promises of God's Word, and you will be
strengthened in time of need. Cling to Christ and trust Him to care for you to the end.

(Hypothermia; Chilblains)
SYMPTOMS—First there is a tingling, then a redness, followed by paleness and numbness in a body
part—generally the fingers, toes, cheeks, nose, and ears. If not immediately cared for, tissue can die and
gangrene sets in.
Frostnip is superficial frostbite, and leaves the area firm, white, and cold. It can result in peeling and
blistering, 24-72 hours later, and perhaps cold sensitivity in the area.
In contrast, deep frostbite produces a cold, hard, white condition, which is painless while it remains
frozen. On rewarming, it becomes blotchy red, swollen, and can be quite painful.
CAUSES—Frostbite or freezing of an exposed body part."
disease-skin-burning-feet,Burning Feet,"TREATMENT
• Add niacin or niacinamide to your diet. (Niacin will cause your face to flush;
niacinamide will not.)
ENCOURAGEMENT—To have a new heart is to have a new mind, new purposes, and new motives.
What is the sign of a new heart? It is a changed life. Through the merits of Christ's righteousness, we can
overcome temptation to doubt and sin. We can live clean, godly lives.

SYMPTOMS—Feet which burn at night.
CAUSES—A lack of niacin (a B vitamin) is a specific deficiency factor."
disease-skin-diaper-rash,Diaper Rash,"TREATMENT
• Give air to that region. Take the diaper off and lay him chest down, with his face turned
to one side, on towels underlaid with a waterproof sheet. Keeping an eye on him, leave
him that way for as long as practicable. But if you do not watch him, you will regret the
results.
• Keep the child bare and exposed to air and sunlight as much as the climate will permit.
• Change the diaper frequently; wash the area with cool water and gently dab dry, using a
soft cotton diaper.
• (Use corn starch as a drying agent; never use talcum powder! It is a powdered rock dust,
and can cause cancer in anyone (infant or adult) that uses it.)
• Expose the infant to small daily doses of sunlight or ultraviolet light. Be careful not to
burn him. No ocean bathing until the rash is gone. But fresh pool water or rainwater is
okay.
• The new super-absorbent diapers greatly help solve the problem. They reduce skin
wetness.
• Try blow-drying the baby before rediapering him.
• Adding vinegar to the final rinse when washing diapers will help reduce the pH of the
cloth. Add 1 ounce of vinegar to 1 gallon of water during the final rinse.
• Giving 2-3 ounces of cranberry juice to older infants will make urine pH slightly more
acid. This helps reduce irritation.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Even though the majority may choose the wrong, yet you can choose the right.
Stay on God's side of the battle, and you will have victory.

(Ammoniacal Dermatitis)
SYMPTOMS—A reddish rash affecting the diaper region, with or without secondary infection by
fungus or bacteria. Redness, tenderness, thickening of skin, inflammation. If secondary yeast infection
appears, the skin will be bright red with well-defined borders, frequently with distinct red papules.
CAUSES—About 50% go away within a day. The rest can last 10 days or longer.
Breast-fed babies have less diaper rash, and this resistance continues long after the baby has been
weaned.
When diaper rash is more prominent later, a food allergy may be the cause."
disease-skin-insect-sting,Insect Sting,"TREATMENT
• Pull out the stinger, if any remains. (Honeybees leave their stinger in the wound. It must
be pulled out immediately, for it keeps pulsating venom into the skin.) Avoid removing
the stinger with your fingers; use a knife blade to scrape it out, to avoid squeezing in more
poison.
• Apply a paste of baking soda and water on the area or a compress that is wet with
ammonia water (more useful for scorpion stings).
• Wet a little calcium gluconate and put it on the area.
• Crush a charcoal tablet and place in the area, and cover with cloth. This will reduce pain
and swelling. Put some wet powdered charcoal in an cloth and tie it on for 3-4 hours.
• Charcoal has an amazing adsorptive (not absorptive) ability to pull into itself toxins and
poisons, thus neutralizing them. This is due to its large chemical surface and the fact that
charcoal is pure carbon. The carbon molecules are eager to unite with other substances.
• Clay or mud can also be used, especially if you are out in the woods. Put some mud on it
as soon as possible and leave it on for a half hour. Try to select the mud from a clean
place, not from a mud hole, where animals may have polluted it. If pain persists, apply
charcoal.
• An enzyme-based meat tenderizer breaks down the proteins that make up insect venom,
but you have to use it right away for it to be effective.
• To avoid infection, do not scratch the area.
• Also helpful are calcium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or ammonium chloride on the area.
• Apply poultice of white oak bark and leaves, comfrey, and slippery elm.
• Pain gels, DMSO, or Caladryl lotions can be applied.
• Calamine lotion often reduces the itching.
• Drink as much yellow dock tea as you can or take echinacea (tea or in capsule form).
• Ironically, either hot or cold will lessen the pain.
• A lengthy hot tub bath will help relieve abdominal pain that often develops after a bite.
• A cold pack or ice pack on the area will help relieve pain.
• Those sensitive to stings should avoid situations in which they might get stung. If they
have to be in such localities, they are wise to carry adrenalin (epinephrine) with them and
be accompanied by a friend who can go for help. Reactions can occur within minutes or
hours. Contact a physician. Death can result if treatment is not sought.
• If you have a known allergy to a certain venom, you can have a physician prescribe an
emergency treatment kit which you can keep with you.
• Purchase a small venom extractor and keep it with you.
• Squashing a yellow jacket releases a chemical that causes other yellow jackets to attack.
When one stings, that also causes the others to become excited. If bit, run. Go indoors or
jump into water. Insects have a hard time following a person through a thicket of woods.
• Insects are repelled by the odor of turpentine.
• Stinging insects prefer dark colors. So wear white or light-colored clothing.
• Do not wear perfumes of any kind.
• Insects are attracted to people who are deficient in zinc. Take at least 60 mg a day.
• Sometimes brewer's yeast or garlic rubbed on the skin deters insects.
• Drinking alcohol or eating an excess of sugar attracts biting, and other, insects.
• Also see ""Spider Bite,"" which includes that of black widows. Also see ""Snake Bite.""
Treatment for a black widow bite is the same as that for a snake bite.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Praise God for all His blessings, and you will have more to praise Him for.
How many are the dangers He has protected you from!

SYMPTOMS—Redness, slight swelling, and possibly some itching.
Reaction to the sting can sometimes be more pronounced: hoarseness, labored breathing, confusion,
difficult swallowing, and severe swelling.
Sometimes the reaction can be severe: possible closing of the airway and perhaps shock (cyanosis and a
drop in blood pressure).
CAUSES—Certain stinging insects in North America can cause reactions (honeybees, bumble bees,
African bees, hornets, scorpions, fire ants, yellow jackets, wasps, spiders, centipedes, and ants). Of
these, the honeybee, yellow jacket, and African bee are the most dangerous.
Bee venom contains formaldehyde.
Note: Each year, bee stings cause more deaths in America than snake bites."
disease-skin-mosquito-bite,Mosquito Bite,"TREATMENT
• To relieve itching: Rub with raw garlic or fresh lemon juice; repeat as often as possible.
Rub with damp salt. Rub with vitamin C tablet or powder.
• To prevent bites from occurring: Eat lots of raw garlic. Avoid sugar and white flour in
all forms. Include vitamin B complex and/or brewer's yeast in the diet.
ENCOURAGEMENT—We strive for happiness, but rarely find it. Only in God can we find genuine,
lasting, peace of heart.

SYMPTOMS—A mosquito bite with its attendant itching.
CAUSES—The culex, aedes, and anopheles mosquitoes are in North America. Malaria can sometimes
occur (which see). The treatment below is for non-malarial bites."
disease-skin-jellyfish-sting,Jellyfish Sting,"TREATMENT
• Immediately rinse the wound with salt water. Do not use fresh water, because it activates
any stinging cells which have not already burst. For the same reason, do not rub the skin.
• Neutralize the area as soon as possible by splashing on one of the following, and do it
again as needed: Use rubbing or ethyl (liquor) alcohol, vinegar, ammonia, or meat
tenderizer. Travel tip: Take a bottle of vinegar with you to the ocean beach.
• If any tentacles remain on your skin, apply a paste of sand and seawater; then wrap your
hand in a towel and wipe them off or scrape them off with a knife or credit card.
ENCOURAGEMENT—God is preparing the hearts of those who dedicate their lives to Him. Soon, at
His coming, they will go to heaven to ever be with Him. This is something each one of us can have.

SYMPTOMS—A strong stinging feeling on the legs or arms while swimming at an ocean beach.
This may afterward be followed by headache, muscle cramps, coughing, shortness of breath, nausea, and
vomiting.
CAUSES—Jellyfish and Portuguese men-of-war are found in warmer marine waters. The eastern
beaches of Florida are one example.
Their long tentacles contain stinging cells which, touching you, pierce the skin and release poison. Even
severed tentacles can poison just as intensively."
disease-skin-spider-bite,Spider Bite,"TREATMENT
• The bite of a black widow should be treated like a snake bite (which see), except that it
is not necessary to give antivenin.
• If there is swelling or pain after a spider bite, keep calm and apply a constricting band 2-
4 inches above (above) the bite. Loosen the band for 15 seconds every 10 minutes. Do not
let the extremity turn blue! Do not move the affected area, and keep it below the heart
level, if possible. The victim should lie down. Pack ice around the wound.
• The objective, throughout the above paragraph, is to slow the blood and reduce spread of
the poison.
• Drink as much yellow dock as possible or take 2 capsules every hour till symptoms
recede. Swallow echinacea. Apply white oak bark poultices. Slippery elm, plantain, or
comfrey are also good.
• Massive doses of vitamin C may save a life.
—See ""Snake Bite"" and ""Insect bite"" for much more information.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Trust Him with all your heart. He will carry you and your burdens. Find in
Him the answers you need.

SYMPTOMS—Pain, swelling, nervous reactions.
Black widow bite: Within a short time the victim feels agonizing pain throughout the body, especially in
the abdomen, which may be rigid as a board. Cold sweats, difficulty in breathing, nausea, vomiting, and
sometimes delirium and convulsions occur.
CAUSES—Spider, scorpion, and centipede bites: These can sometimes be dangerous; most are very
painful. (Also see ""Insect Bite."") In case of spider bite, see a physician; it might be a black widow.
Black widow bites: Black widow venom is more potent, drop for drop, than the poison of a pit viper
(rattlesnake, copperhead, or cotton mouth); but an extremely small amount is injected in each spider
bite."
disease-skin-snake-bite,Snake Bite,"TREATMENT
• The best single remedy you can keep on hand is a small hand-suction extractor for
immediately pulling the poison out of the wound. Continue this for half an hour. (This
suction is less useful for coral snake venom, but use it on all snake bites anyway!) If there
is no other way to extract the poison, another person should suck it out, continually
spitting out the blood, for half an hour.
• The person doing the sucking should not have any sores in his mouth.
• Suction can also be done with a pop bottle heated and applied. As it cools a vacuum is
formed.
• Another alternative is to cut off the end of a plastic injection syringe at the bottom of the
large end, apply to the bitten area, and pull back on the plunger.
• Have the patient lie down, keep him calm and warm, apply a tourniquet above the limb
where the wound is. This constricting band should be tight enough to shut off the venous
blood, but not so tight that it stops the arterial circulation. Loosen the band 15 seconds
every 10 minutes.
• The instruction formerly was to cut across between the two bite holes, so you could suck
out more blood and poison. The current theory is that no cuts should be made, but only
sucking. It might be the best to suck and spit for a couple minutes; this will clean the
surface as well. Then cut across, so you can suck even better. But, when you are in the
crisis, do what seems best.
• Do not give liquor to the person, thinking that this will help him. It does not!
• Specific antivenin serums are in stock for various species of snakes. Learn to identify the
various snakes in your locality. (Coral snakes are primarily found only in the southeastern
states.)
• Massive doses of vitamin C may save a life.
• Keep calm and work carefully. Excitement speeds up the blood flow to the heart.
• In most cases, the person does not die. But pray and get yourself prepared for whatever
may happen.
• After the suction process is over, take charcoal from the campfire, mix it with water and
drink it, as follows: a half glassful of water with 1 teaspoon of charcoal, and drink another
one every 15 minutes until the danger is past.
• If able to do so, a couple hours later, take a steam bath or something similar, to sweat out
the poison.
• Throughout all this time, you should eat no food.
• If, after several hours, the bite area is still swollen and painful, put kerosene on a cloth
and apply it, keeping it wet for several hours. This will help neutralize the poison. An
alternative is to grind up raw onions and apply to the area. Leave them there until an
offensive odor, not of onions, is noticed. Remove; bathe the area; and apply more raw,
crushed, onions until the pain is gone.
ENCOURAGEMENT—When trials and tribulations come to you, know that every thing will work out
well if, through dedication and prayer, you will keep close to God.
Section 16
Poisons
Part 2
Transmitted Diseases

SYMPTOMS—One or two tiny bite holes which cause intense pain; frequently there is nausea,
vomiting, and unconsciousness.
CAUSES—There are two types of poisonous serpents in North America:
The pit viper (which includes rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cotton mouths [also called water
moccasins]) has a deep, heat-sensitive, pit on each side of the head. Pit vipers lunge forward, bite, and
immediately pull back. Their venom contains a blood poison.
The coral snake does not jump and, when it catches hold of the flesh, must hold on and chew awhile for
the poison to sink in. Its venom is a nerve poison.
More on identifying coral snakes: They are found only in the southernmost areas of the United States, as
well as south of the border, and have brightly colored rings. There is a non-poisonous snake which looks
similar, but the colored rings are arranged differently. Remember it this way: ""Red by black, friend of
Jack; but black by yellow, kill a fellow.""
The danger from snake bite occurs when the poison reaches the heart, and, secondarily, the effect of that
poison on the blood and nervous system.
The action of the venom is rapid, regardless of the type of poisonous snake. There is rapid swelling and
inflammation.
If treatment is not immediately given, the poison may cause death. If not death, then, after the initial
effects of pain and shock begin to wear off, extensive tissue damage begins. There is suppuration,
gangrene, sloughing, and hemorrhage. If this happens, recovery time is greatly slowed."
disease-skin-dog-or-animal-bite,Dog Or Animal Bite,"TREATMENT
• If you have been bitten, remove the animal's saliva from the wound by washing the area
thoroughly with warm water, and then with soap and water. Rinse with plain water. Either
catch the dog and confine it or know who the owner is. Notify health authorities, so they
can observe the animal.
—See ""Rabies"" for detailed information about this danger and what should be done. Also see ""Tetanus.""
Tetanus is far less likely, yet is a possibility.
ENCOURAGEMENT—All experiences and circumstances are God's workmen whereby good is
brought to us. Let us look at the light behind the cloud.

SYMPTOMS—You are bitten by an animal.
CAUSES—A dog or other animal has bitten you; is it dangerous?
The first question is has the skin been broken? If the tissues have been merely squeezed, then the matter
is of little importance. There may be soreness and a black-and-blue appearance, but it will soon
disappear.
But if there has been penetration—an actual wound—then action must be taken. The animal may be
perfectly healthy, but of that you cannot be certain.
The animal's teeth may cause the spores of tetanus germs to enter the body or the animal may be rabid.
Such bites, if not promptly treated, can result in death."
disease-skin-drug-rash,Drug Rash,"TREATMENT
• Stop using the medicinal drug. Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance (all you can, before its
acidity causes a slight diarrhea). Take vitamins A, B complex, and E. Be sure selenium
and zinc are in your diet. Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as seaweed.
• If the drug has an acid base, consider taking a soda alkaline bath (Water Therapy
Manual, p. 142)(see order sheet). Fill a bath tub with water at 95o-98o F. Add about a cup
of baking soda or sodium bicarbonate. Sitting in the tub, dip and pour it over yourself.
After 30-60 minutes, stand in the tub, partially drip dry, and pat yourself dry.
—Also see ""Eczema.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—The throne of grace is to be our continual dependence. There is strength for us
in Christ. He is our Advocate before the Father.

CAUSES—It is truly surprising what a high percentage of medicinal drugs are poisonous. But it need
not be, when the underlying modus operandi (method by which they work) is understood.
Medicinal drugs work by introducing a strange new poison into the body. The system immediately turns
its attention from the debilitated area—and begins fighting the drug. The type of poison (the drug)
introduced, and the way it operates, affects the reaction of the body. For example, the body was
eliminating sulphur through a boil but then a drug is introduced, and the boil seemingly ""heals."" The
body has let the boil no longer suppurate, so attention can be diverted to the radical poison which has
been introduced.
Natural remedies operate in a different way: They clean out the body and restore it to a healthy
normalcy. Whether it be fresh air, pure water, nutritious food, simple herbs, or water treatments, the
natural remedies assist the body in carrying on its work of cleansing the body. For that is what ""dis-ease""
is: an effort of nature to cleanse the body of impurities and eliminate the effects of enervation.
A drug is a foreign substance of a poisonous nature. The healing herbs are not ""drugs."" It is true that
about five of every 100 herbs is poisonous, but natural therapy only uses the safe ones. The poisonous
ones can be purchased at the drugstore or grocery counter (tobacco, coffee, black tea, chocolate, black
pepper, digitalis, quinine, etc.). Such things as aspirin, valium, phenobarbital, dilantin, morphine, etc.,
are foreign chemical substances of a poisonous nature. They all produce dangerous side effects, called
""contraindications.""
In contrast, the safe herbs are the ones you eat (all your worthwhile vegetables) and use for treating your
ills. They were given us by the God of heaven (Genesis 1:29).
Most of the damage that drugs inflict on the body is beneath the skin, but drug rashes are effects on the
skin.
Here are but a few examples of drugs which produce drug rashes:
Antipyrine: Papular, erythematous rash, sometimes accompanied by edema and much irritation.
Arsenic: Papular or erythematous rash, sometimes urticarial. Prolonged use may produce pigmentation
of skin.
Belladonna: Erythematous rash, usually accompanied by intense itching.
Bromides: Usually like acne vulgaris. Sometimes erythema.
Chloral: Papular erythema.
Iodides: Usually papular erythema, sometimes with acne-like pustules.
Phenolphthalein: Macular rash, sometimes purpuric.
Quinine: Very irritable erythema or urticaria.
Salicylate: Erythematous rash, possibly morbilliform.
Serum: Usually urticaria.
Sulfonal: Erythematous or urticarial rash.
Here are some other drugs which produce skin rashes: opium compounds, acetanilide, amidopyrine,
barbiturates, ephedrine, novocain, sulfanilamide, and other sulfa drugs.
Some of the drugs have been given very nice-sounding names, but note the chemicals in them: calomel
(mercurous chloride), green vitriol (ferrous sulfate), goulard water (lead lotion), oil of vitriol (sulfuric
acid), and vermilion (mercury sulfide). Most drugs are compounded from, not two but, a wide range of
extremely complex and very poisonous chemical mixtures.
Let it be emphasized that most drugs work their damage in a thousand other ways in the body, without
producing skin rashes."
disease-skin-fasting,Fasting,"You should be aware of the fact that, by the time symptoms of pain accompany cancer, it is in the
advanced stages. At that point, the body urgently needs good nourishment, as well as cleansing; it should
not be given fasts. For further information on this, see the Gerson Therapy, later in this book.
But, as a cancer preventative, occasional fasting is helpful. Cancer prevention is theme of this entire Part
One section of this book.
• Fasts on fruit and vegetable juices of 1 to 3 days can be taken. If under the care of someone who
knows what to do, and you are not thin, a longer fast may be undertaken.
• Go on a fresh fruit diet for several days. If the patient is thin, after a few days of fruit diet, give him
an alkaline nourishing diet. This would consist of vegetable broth (simmer thick potato peelings,
carrots, and beets; strain; drink the water on top), mashed half-inch thick potato peelings, brown rice,
carrots, greens of all kinds, red cabbage, parsley, and other vegetables.
• Eating good food treats malnutrition, and many people develop cancer because of a lack of the
protective, nourishing food needed to resist it.
• There is a theory that you can starve cancer to death. This has been proven untrue. Cancer does better
in a malnourished body. One study revealed that pure malnutrition (cachexia) is responsible for at least
22% and up to 75% of all cancer deaths."
disease-urinary-kidney-problems,Kidney Problems,"TREATMENT
• Eat 75% raw foods, including garlic, parsley, potatoes, celery, cucumbers, and bananas.
Green vegetables are especially important.
• Stop eating meat. An excess of protein is part of your problem; and meat also has a
variety of waste products, plus bacteria, purines, and uric acid.
• Avoid dairy products, except yogurt. Do not eat chocolate or cocoa.
• Drink 6-8 ounces of distilled water every hour.
• Watermelon and pumpkin seeds seem to help the kidneys, although the reason is not
known.
• Corn-silk tea is the best single herb for increasing urine flow and restoring the kidneys.
Watermelon-seed tea and celery and parsley seeds are also diuretic in function.
• Cranberries help acidify the urine, destroy bacteria, and restore the bladder.
• Do not eat much potassium or phosphorous. For this reason, avoid beet greens, spinach,
rhubarb, and Swiss chard.
• Lead, other metals, the pain relieving drugs (Advil, Nuprin, etc.), and infectious diseases
(scarlet fever, measles, etc.) can damage the kidneys. Spirulina is known to reduce kidney
poisoning that is caused by mercury and drugs.
ENCOURAGEMENT—Only to those who receive Christ as their Saviour is given the power to
become sons and daughters of God. The sinner cannot, by any power of his own, rid himself of sin. But
Christ can give the needed strength to come off victor in the battle with Satan.
KIDNEY STONES—1
(Nephrocalcinosis)
SYMPTOMS—Intermittent, dull, dragging pain radiating from the upper back to the lower abdomen,
usually increased by motion.
There is bleeding and renal colic (strong kidney pain) when the stone enters the ureters. These sharp
pains may last hours or days. There is increased urination with pus and blood, pallor, nausea, and
vomiting. Sometimes there are fever and chills.
When you have bloody urine and sharp pain in the bladder or kidneys, it is very likely kidney stones.
CAUSES—Kidney stones (also called bladder stones or cystic calculi) are an abnormal accumulations
of mineral salts. They form in the kidneys and, during passage down the ureters, may lodge in them or in
the bladder. The stones are primarily composed of calcium oxalate; but urates, phosphates, and cystine
may also be present.
Oddly enough, a key factor in the production of kidney stones is a calcium and/or magnesium
deficiency. The minerals in the stones come from your own bones!
Refined carbohydrates, especially sugar, prompts kidney stone formation. The sugar increases in the
pancreas and excretes additional insulin, which in turn causes the kidneys to discharge more calcium in
the urine.
Calcium is needed by the body. If not enough calcium is in the diet, the parathyroids will signal the body
to extract calcium from the bones in order to keep the blood calcium level at normal levels.
A vitamin B and magnesium deficiency may also cause stone formation. A Swedish research group
6
found that taking both daily stopped stone formation in 90% of their patients. Magnesium, like calcium,
can bond with the oxalate. B (10 mg a day) lowers the amount of oxalate in the urine.
6
In response to lowered blood calcium levels, the parathyroids trigger the body to draw it out of the
bones.
It is vital that you obtain a balanced diet of vitamins and minerals every day.
Partial causes of kidney stone formation can include dehydration (not drinking enough water),
infections, prolonged periods of rest in bed, and only rarely taking vitamin D and calcium.
Too much food, including acid-forming foods—especially meat, along with white-flour products, sugar
foods, tea, coffee, spices, and vinegar—all help produce an excess of waste in the kidneys. Eventually it
accumulates into gravel and stones.
• It is vital that you increase the amount of water you drink! Kidney health is keyed to an
adequate fluid level in the blood. Only use distilled water.
• Used in conjunction with more fluid intake, corn-silk tea increases urine output, a very
necessary factor in purifying and detoxifying the kidneys.
• Watermelon provides additional water. Eat it alone and often, but do not eat it with other
foods during meals.
• A lack of vitamin A can lead to stone formation. It helps protect the lining of the urinary
tract.
• A more acid urine prevents and dissolves kidney stones. Drink cranberry juice
frequently. (One writer says that Ocean Spray brand is only 30% cranberry juice, plus
sugar, etc.) All other fruit juices become alkaline in the system. Do not put vinegar into
the body.
• Eat potassium broth. This is made from thick potato peelings. Cook it with carrots,
garlic, and celery. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, then strain and drink the liquid. Excess can
be stored in the refrigerator for no more than 2 days.
• Oxalate, a key chemical in kidney stone formation, occurs naturally in various green
vegetables; some more than others. Rhubarb has the highest oxalic acid content of
anything eaten by man. Also do not eat spinach, chard, or beet tops. About 60% of all
stones are calcium oxalate in nature.
• Drink watermelon-seed tea; steep in hot water for 15 minutes, strain, add a little honey
and drink.
• There may be an excess of purines. Stop eating meat. Meat-based proteins are a causal
factor in producing kidney stones. Do not overeat on other proteins.
• Do not use soft drinks, caffeine, chocolate, cocoa, pepper, nuts, poppy seeds, or black
tea.
• Reduce salt intake.
• A strict macrobiotic diet (lots of grains and little fruits and vegetables) tends to
concentrate the urine and may cause stones. But this is not a primary cause of them.
• Take licorice, to reduce swelling of the ureters, so the stone can pass. Calcium and
magnesium are crucial to stop the calcium loss from the bones. Eat less meat to get your
calcium/phosphorous ratio in order (meat is full of phosphorous).
• The following herbs are helpful: dandelion, rupturewort, and madder.
• To dissolve kidney stones, drink hot water and lemon juice. Follow with olive oil. For
the complete formula for this, see ""Gallstones.""

—Also see Kidney"" Stones—1.""

PROBLEMS AND CAUSES—In addition to other conditions mentioned in this section on the kidneys,
there are less known diseases which can be just as serious. These include:
Renal tubular acidosis: The kidneys fail to reabsorb bicarbonate properly, resulting in inadequate
ammonia production and acid excretion. This leads to a severe lack of fluid and potassium in the body,
and an excess of acidity. The bones can become deranged.
Hydronephrosis: The kidneys and bladder become filled with urine, due to obstruction of the flow.
Glomerulonephritis: This is an inflammation of the tiny kidney filtering units, sometimes resulting from
a bacterial infection in the body.
Uremia: A toxic waste buildup in the blood, due to kidney malfunction.
In all of these conditions, a basic need is to cleanse the kidneys, increase urine flow, and restore proper
function."
disease-urinary-renal-colic,Renal Colic,"TREATMENT
• Drink plenty of pure water. Avoid coffee, alcohol, and artificial drinks.
• Drinking unsweetened cranberry juice and apple juice helps reduce bacterial growth in
the kidneys.
• Carrot, celery, and parsley juice is also helpful.
• Eat nourishing food, and avoid processed and junk food.
• Include enough vitamins C, A, and B complex in the diet. Potassium deficiencies can
encourage kidney problems.
• Go on a 3-day cleansing water-and-juice fast. Take enemas and rest. Keep the fluid level
high.
• Helpful herbs include garlic, echinacea, burdock, red clover, and goldenseal. Also of
value: juniper berries, parsley, and watermelon-seed tea. Buchu tea and marshmallow tea
are most helpful.
• Used in conjunction with more fluid intake, corn-silk tea has been used for hundreds of
years to increase urine output, a very necessary factor in purifying and detoxifying the
kidneys.

NEPHRITIS—1
(Kidney Infection)
SYMPTOMS—There may be no symptoms or they may include blood and/or albumin in the urine and
lower back, abdominal pain, even chills, fatigue, edema, nausea and vomiting, frequent urge to urinate,
and loss of appetite. Severe cases may include anemia and high blood pressure.
CAUSES—This is inflammation of one or both kidneys. Thousands of tiny cells in the kidneys filter
fluids out of the blood in order to purify it. But the filter can become plugged with toxins and mucous.
When these tiny cells become swollen and inflamed, infection soon follows.
This infection can be acute or chronic, and may require hospitalization.
Constipation causes a toxic matter to be reabsorbed by the blood. This clogs the kidneys.
Overuse of aspirin and other pain killers weaken the kidneys; beer can cause their failure. Environmental
toxins, such as heavy metals, add to the damage. Anti-hypertensive drugs are used to reduce blood
circulation, and therefore injure the kidneys.
Kidney infection can also be caused by bacterial infection in the bladder (cystitis, which see) which has
traveled up the ureters to the kidneys."
disease-urinary-bladder-problems,Bladder Problems,"TREATMENT
• Increase the fluid intake—lots of water, especially distilled, is best. Drink a half pint
every 20 minutes for 3 hours, then one cup every hour. This is important.
• Also drink cranberry juice. When you have this problem, citrus juice is not as good,
since it tends to make the urine more alkaline, encouraging bacterial growth.
• Eat a nourishing diet; avoid the wrong foods. See ""Nephritis"" (kidney infection) for
much more information on the proper care and healing of the urinary tract. The bladder
and kidneys are closely associated; whatever helps one helps the other.
• Acidify the urine by drinking 1-2 quarts of cranberry juice per day, for the first day, and
1 quart a day thereafter while the crisis continues.
• Helpful herbs include juniper, lovage, parsley, uva ursi, rupturewort, bearberry, birch,
and prickly restharrow. Of course, do not add sweetener or milk to the tea.
• Drink tea made from 2-3 crushed or blended garlic bulbs several times a day.
• The use of aluminum cookware is another cause of cystic symptoms. Avoid zinc and
iron supplements until this problem is healed.
• Potassium deficiencies can lead to renal (kidney) disorders.
• To relieve the pain and encourage healing, take hot sitz (sitting) baths twice a day, for 20
minutes. To one of those daily sitz baths, add 1 cup of vinegar. The next day, add 2 cloves
crushed garlic or garlic juice to the water of one of the two baths.
• A hot water bottle placed in direct contact to the urethral and vaginal openings may be
extremely helpful in reducing pain. A heat lamp can also be used.
• Women should especially avoid bacterial infection ascending into the bladder: The
urinary outlet of the urethra is close to the vagina. When sexual intercourse is not done
with clean hands or too frequently, germs are more likely to enter the urethra. Wipe from
front to back following bowel movements, urinate before and after intercourse, and wear
cotton underclothing (it lets air through and absorbs moisture better). Avoid douches,
hygiene sprays, bubble baths, soap in the bath water, and nylon clothing. Wash carefully
during the monthly, to avoid bacteria from going up the urethra. Do not use tampons if
there are frequent urinary tract infections. Rinse underwear well, to get all the soap out.
Boil panties in plain water. Shower after bathing in a swimming pool. Dress to keep the
extremities warm; cold extremities weaken the trunk organs, including the urinary tract.
Birth control pills and spermaticides may cause cystitis.
—See ""Cystitis—2.""
ENCOURAGEMENT—Christ was lifted upon the cross of Calvary, to draw all men unto Himself.
What shall we do then with Jesus? Shall we accept Him or reject Him? But more: How shall we treat
His purchased possessions, those around us? Will we do all we can to help them?
CYSTITIS—2; and Irritable Bladder
(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)
INFLAMMATION—Copious water drinking; Revulsive Sitz Bath, twice a day; Hot Leg Packs
followed by dry heat (Radiant Heat bath) to legs; Neutral Bath for 20-40 minutes, 2-3 times a week;
prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub; Fomentation over bladder; Hot
Enema; Hot Pelvic Pack; Aseptic Dietary.
IRRITABLE BLADDER—With inflammation not present: Very Hot Sitz Bath for 5 minutes, followed
by Neutral Sitz Bath for 10-20 minutes. Hot Pack to pelvis, Heating Compress over perineum and
genitals, Revulsive Sitz, Hot Colonic.
CONTRAINDICATIONS—Do not apply Cold Sitz Bath, Cold Full Bath, Cold Douche, or Cold
FootBath.
—See ""Cystitis—1.""

HYDRO—Here are several hydrotherapy applications found in the author's book, Water Therapy
Manual (see order sheet):
Bladder atony: Ascending Douche. This is a jet or spray directed upward, in this case, against the
perineum (p. 159). Abdominal Douche (a spray to the front of the abdomen only (p. 165).
Bladder inflammation: Copious water drinking. Revulsive Sitz Bath, twice a day; Hot Leg Packs,
followed by dry heat (Radiant Heat Bath) to legs; Neutral Bath 20-40 minutes, 2-3 times a week;
Prolonged Neutral Sitz Bath; Cold Mitten Friction; Cold Towel Rub; Fomentation over bladder, Hot
Enema; Hot Pelvic Pack; Aseptic Dietary (p. 180).
Irritable bladder: When inflammation is not present, give a Very Hot Sitz Bath for 5 minutes, followed
by Neutral Sitz Bath for 10-20 minutes. Hot pack to pelvis, Heating Compress over perineum and
genitals, Revulsive Sitz, and Hot Colonic (p. 180).
Bladder insufficiency: Spinal (Dorsal) Douche. This is a hand-held hosing of water to the dorsal (upper
and central) part of the spine. The stream should be allowed to play rapidly up and down, extending 3-4
inches on either side of the spine. Give tepid water for irritability of the bladder (when of spinal origin).
Give a Cold Spinal Douche for motor insufficiency of the bladder, resulting in urinary incontinence or
retention (p. 160).
Bladder paresis (paralysis): Daily colonic. Cold Plantar Douche, that is, to bottom of feet (p. 219).
Bladder retention: Lumbar Revulsive Douche. This spray should be hot, and then very brief cold, and
will help alleviate urinary retention, due to spasm in the neck of the bladder (p. 161).
ENCOURAGEMENT—As we cherish and obey the promptings of the Holy Spirit to obey God and
help others, our hearts are enlarged to receive more and more of His power and to do more and better
work. As we seek to help others, the angels work with us.
CYSTITIS—1
(Bladder and Urinary Tract Infection)
SYMPTOMS—Pain in the lower abdomen and back; frequent, urgent, and painful urination. Urine
often has a strong, unpleasant odor and may appear cloudy (from pus). A desire to urinate even after the
bladder has been emptied.
Children with this condition may experience a painful burning sensation when urinating.
CAUSES—Cystitis is an infection of the urinary bladder. It is the most frequent bacterial infection in
women. About 10-15% of them have recurrent bladder infections.
The cause is generally bacteria which have ascended up from the urinary opening, but, less frequently,
from infected urine sent down from the kidneys.
The usual cause is ascended bacteria, and cystitis most often occurs in females. The urinary outlet of the
urethra is close to the vagina. Ways to avoid cross infection between the two are given in the concluding
paragraph of this article.
Frequency, urgency, and burning urine are obvious symptoms of cystitis, but a home test can be also be
done: Purchase ""Dipstick"" at a pharmacy and follow directions. A positive nitrate test will reveal the
presence of a large quantity of white blood cells, indicating infection in the urinary tract.
Women who frequently have bladder infections often have enlarged bladders from having tried to retain
their urine. In order to maintain good urinary tract health, it is important to drink water and urinate
frequently.
In older men, the cause of the bladder problem might be kidney stones (which see).
Blood in the urine could indicate a more serious problem. Consult a physician. (Also see ""Hematuria"").
Bladder infection in men may signal prostate trouble.
Cyclamate (an artificial sweetener found in synthetic sugar) causes bladder tumors."
disease-urinary-autism,Autism,"TREATMENT
• Dr. Bernard Rimland, a research psychologist in San Diego, found that 50% of his
patients improved when placed on a megavitamin therapy.
• The vitamins which especially helped were niacin (use as niacinamide), pantothenic
acid, B and C. When improvement did not occur, additional B was given, along with
6 6
magnesium, to offset the B , and then improvement was seen.
6
• As soon as the vitamin therapy ceased, the symptoms returned.
• As a result of vitamin therapy, there was a reduction in tantrums, improved speech,
better sleep patterns, increased alertness, and greater sociability.
• Allan Cott, M.D., a New York psychiatrist, gave 200 mg of pangamic acid to autistic
children, and decided improvement frequently occurred.
• Give a nourishing diet high in vitamins and minerals.
• The diet should be high fiber, of 50-75% raw fruits and vegetables.
• No junk, processed, sugar, dairy, wheat, or white-flour foods of any kind should be
given. Avoid fried and fatty foods and most meats.
• Regular, moderate, exercise is important.
• Use an elimination diet, to test for food allergies (see ""Allergies"" and ""Pulse Test"").
ENCOURAGEMENT—The Lord has not changed. He is true, merciful, compassionate, and faithful to
do what He says. Trust your life to Him! You will not be sorry. The future He offers you is a marvelous
one.
Section 10
Muscular-Skeletal
Part 1
Bones

SYMPTOMS—Symptoms are very obvious before the age of three: A marked unresponsiveness to
other people and surroundings, indifferent to affection, and withdrawn into themselves.
Sometimes strange actions, such as pounding feet while sitting, continual rocking back and forth, silent
sitting for long periods of time, bursts of hyperactivity while they bite, or pound, on their bodies.
CAUSES—There are about 100,000 autistic children in America. They look normal in appearance; but,
in addition to the above symptoms, they have learning disabilities and are often mentally disabled. A
rare few have astounding abilities in mathematics or music.
Nutritional improvement appears to be the best route for natural treatment.
In some instances, autistic children have recovered, usually during adolescence. Some progress well, and
later lose what was gained.
If you have an autistic child, give him a high B-complex supplementation, plus other nutritional factors."
herb-the-most-important-herbs,The Most Important Herbs,"A rather complete discussion of herbs had been planned for this book, but it will not be included for three reasons: First, there are many worthwhile herb books available. Second, to cover the subject properly (herbal preparation, properties, and contraindications) would require at least 75 pages, and this book is already too big now. But it did seem well to list the most important herbs and mention a few other basic facts. One problem with herbs is that few of us can afford to keep more than a small collection of them on hand. Since they are not used a lot, purchasing could be a problem, since they are likely to spoil before we used them up. So it would be well to know which ones are the most important! Here is a list prepared by the present writer. Read it, change the list around to suit your own family needs,—and then stock up on a few beneficial herbs, so you will have them on hand when you need them most. HERE ARE THE 12, 20, 50, AND 60 MOST IMPORTANT HERBS:"
herb-most-important-herbs,Most Important Herbs,"1 - CHARCOAL—This is not an herb, yet it is invaluable in a number of ways. Charcoal is pure carbon, and will adsorb (not absorb) 29 of the 30 most dangerous poisons. You can drink it diluted in water, use it as a poultice on wounds, skin infections, etc. 2 - CAYENNE—Dr. Christopher, a well-known herbalist of the mid-20th century, said that if he only had two herbs, he would select charcoal and cayenne. Cayenne is powerful in its ability to attract blood to a body part. Since it is the blood which brings healing, this can be an important quality. Internally, it is useful for arteriosclerosis, arthritis, asthma, bleeding, high or low blood pressure, bronchitis, chills, colds, convulsions, coughs, indigestion, infections, jaundice, ulcers, and varicose veins. Externally, it is used for frostbite, painful joints, swellings, and varicose veins. When added to herbal formulas, it stimulates the action of other herbs. It is a preventative for heart attacks, flu, colds, indigestion, and lack of vitality. It is good for treating the spleen, pancreas, kidneys and is effective as a fomentation for rheumatism, inflammation, pleurisy, sores, and wounds. It can be rubbed on toothaches and swellings. 3 - GARLIC—This is one of the most powerful antiseptic substances ever discovered. In the 1950s, Soviet scientists found it to be equal to penicillin, yet without the harmful effects of that powerful drug. Internally, it is used for arteriosclerosis, cancer, contagious disease, coughs, cramps, diverticulitis, emphysema, gas, heart problems, high blood pressure, indigestion, liver congestion, parasites, rheumatism, sinus congestion, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for bowel problems, parasites, ringworm, skin parasites, tumors, warts, and yeast infections. Garlic is used for all lung and respiratory ailments, and can be used as a tea or added to syrups for coughs, colds, tuberculosis, fevers, and blood diseases. Use it as a tea in an enema for worms and bowel infections. Use the fresh extract oil or eat the raw cloves. 4 - GOLDENSEAL—This is another powerful antiseptic; and, in a sense, it is the first true herb on this list. (The first three can be purchased in the grocery store.) Internally, it is good for alcoholism, allergies, asthma, bad breath, bladder diseases, bronchitis, canker sores, chicken pox, colds, diabetes, eczema, bleeding gums or gum infections, hay fever, heart weakness, hemorrhoids, herpes, indigestion, infections, inflammations, leukorrhea, liver problems, lymph congestion, measles, mammary and ovarian tumors, morning sickness, sore mouth, pyorrhea, tonsillitis, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for burns, canker sores, eye inflammations, bleeding gums, gum infections, herpes sores, leukorrhea, mouth sores, ringworm, skin inflammation, tonsillitis, and wounds. Goldenseal can be used on open sores, inflammations, eczema, ringworm, erysipelas, or itchy skin conditions. It is a specific for all kinds of mucous membrane problems. Snuffed up the nose, it is good for nasal catarrh. Small doses will relieve nausea during pregnancy. It is a douche for vaginal infections, an eyewash, and an antiseptic mouthwash for pyorrhea. Used with cascara sagrada, it is a bowel tonic. As a retention enema, it will reduce swollen hemorrhoids. 5 - PEPPERMINT—This is an old household remedy, and is useful for a variety of conditions. Internally, it is useful for insomnia, measles, menstrual cramps, migraines, morning sickness, muscle spasms, nausea, nervous disorders, chills, colic, fevers, dizziness, gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysentery, and hysteria. Externally, it is used for skin itch, toothache, and local anesthetic to local pains and inflamed joints. For example, to open up the sinuses, put 5-10 drops into 2 quarts hot water and breathe it in through the mouth and nostrils. Cover the head with a cloth as you do this. 6 - SLIPPERY ELM—This is the inner white bark of the slippery elm tree, and is invaluable to keep on hand. (The outer dark bark is also sold, but is useless.) Internally, it is used for bladder inflammation, bronchitis, colitis, constipation, ovarian cramps, coughs, cystitis, diarrhea, diverticulitis, dysentery, eczema, flu, gas, hemorrhage, hemorrhoids, hoarseness, lung congestion, stomach problems, tonsillitis, ulcers. Externally, it is used for burns, colitis, constipation, diverticulitis, dysentery, gangrenous wounds, hemorrhoids, leukorrhea, open sores, rheumatoid and gouty afflictions, and wounds. Slippery elm is also used to bind materials of suppositories, boluses, lozenges, and unleavened breads together. It makes a nourishing gruel for children, for the elderly with weak stomachs, for those with ulcers and those who are recovering from diseases. If used as a douche or enema, it must be diluted with water so it will not plug the apparatus (since it is a mucilaginous herb). 7 - LOBELIA—This is both a relaxant and stimulant, and a powerful helper. Internally, it is used for allergies, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chicken pox, contagious diseases, convulsions, coughs, earache, ear infections, fevers (all kinds), headache, heart palpitation, indigestion, jaundice, pleurisy, pneumonia, food poisoning, St. Vitus dance, teething, toothache. Externally, it is used for snake and insect bites, poison ivy, ringworm, and tumors. Small doses of a tincture of lobelia (5-10 drops) will act as a tonic and stimulant; larger doses will act as a sedative. It relieves spasms and acts as an expectorant. It can be used as a wash on infected or itchy skin conditions. In large doses, it is an excellent emetic. It is especially good in spasmodic coughing of phlegm. Taken in small doses, it relaxes the heart and lowers rapid pulse. 8 - ALOE VERA—The gel from the leaves of this desert plant is invaluable. It is best used freshly picked from a plant. Keep several plants growing; you cannot have enough! Internally, it is good for chronic constipation, gastritis, hyperacidity, and stomach ulcers. Externally, it is used for abscesses, burns, infection in wounds, insect bites, skin irritations, and ulcers. When applied on the skin for severe burns and skin rashes, it can be left on for two days without changing the application. Do not use it during pregnancy, nor in large doses when there are hemorrhoids. 9 - CASCARA SAGRADA—This is one of the safest laxatives for chronic constipation, and is not habit forming. Internally, it is used for constipation, cough, gall bladder disease, gallstones, gastric and intestinal disorders, hemorrhoids, indigestion, and jaundice. 10 - CORN SILK—This is the best single herb for increasing urine flow, thus helping to eliminate kidney and bladder problems. Internally, it is used for bed-wetting, chronic cystitis, inflammation of kidneys and bladder, kidney stones, prostatitis, excess uric acid, and urine retention. It is a good remedy for all inflammatory conditions of the urethra, bladder, prostate, and kidney; it can remove gravel from the kidneys, bladder and prostate. It helps the aged when their urine is scanty and has heavy sediment. 11 - HOPS—This is an excellent nervine and will produce sleep when insomnia is present. But it also has other uses. Internally, it is used for coughs, fever, headaches, indigestion, insomnia, jaundice, morning sickness, weak nerves, stomach tonic, throat, bronchial tubes, chest ailments, toothache, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for boils, bruises, earaches, inflammations, rheumatic pains, skin ailments, and ulcers. The tea is good for nervous stomach, poor appetite, gas, and intestinal cramps. Cold tea before meals will increase digestion. The dry herb can be placed inside a pillow; it will induce sleep. 12 - WITCH HAZEL—This is an excellent astringent herb and is one of the best remedies for stopping excessive menstruation, hemorrhages from the lungs, stomach, uterus, and bowels. Internally, it is used for diarrhea, diphtheria, hemorrhoids, leukorrhea, prolapsed bowel, varicose veins, and uterine problems. It is used to stop bleeding from the lungs, uterus, and other internal organs. Externally, it is used for burns, bruises, diphtheria, insect bites, leukorrhea, sore breasts, sore muscles, tonsillitis, and varicose veins. Witch hazel can be used as an injection for bleeding piles, vaginal discharges, and infections. As either fomentation or poultice, it is good for wounds, bed sores, sore and inflamed eyes, and oozing skin diseases. It is good for almost any internal or external inflamed condition."
herb-most-important-herbs,Most Important Herbs,"(A TOTAL OF TWENTY BASIC HERBS) Here are the next eight most important herbs. Added to the above, you will have the twenty most important herbs. 13 - CATNIP—This is wonderful for children and infants when gas, stomach cramps, or nervousness occur. This is the children's herb, but it is also helpful to grown-ups. Internally, it is used for colds, bronchitis, dizziness, fevers, gas, diarrhea, headaches, hysteria, insomnia, morning sickness, mumps, smallpox, and urine retention. Externally, it is used for constipation, mumps, and painful swellings. Use catnip as an enema to expel worms. Drink the tea for headaches caused by indigestion. 14 - COMFREY—This is an all-around good remedy. Internally, it is used for anemia, arthritis, asthma, internal bleeding, blood purifier, bronchitis, calcium deficiency, colitis, coughs, diarrhea, dysentery, emphysema, gall bladder inflammation. Externally, it is used for boils, bruises, burns, psoriasis, and sprains. Comfrey is excellent for dysentery; one of the best for internal bleeding; excellent for coughs; catarrh; ulcerated bowels, stomach, and lungs. Bruise the fresh leaves and apply as a poultice to wounds, burns, open sores, gangrene, and moist ulcers. The tea can also be put on them. Keep some growing in your garden. Once established, it will keep coming up year after year. 15 - ECHINACEA—This is a powerful blood cleanser, and is tolerated by the system in fairly large amounts. Internally, it is used for acne, bad breath, bladder infections, blood poisoning, blood purifier, boils, fevers, gangrene, infections, inflammation of mammary glands, intestinal antiseptic, leukopenia (reduction in blood leukocytes), lymphatic congestion, skin diseases, tonsillitis, uremic poisoning, and venereal disease. Externally, it is used for open wounds and painful swellings. Echinacea is an excellent antibiotic, and ranks with goldenseal and red clover. It has been used against syphilis and gonorrhea. 16 - FLAXSEED—This is even more mucilaginous than slippery elm and is good for a variety of problems. Internally, it is used for asthma, bronchitis, catarrh, constipation, coughs, diarrhea, enteritis, flatulence, hemorrhoids, lung and chest problems, pleurisy, and stomach ulcers. In poultices, flaxseed is excellent for sores, boils, inflammations, and tumors. Combine it with slippery elm for boils, oozing sores, and burns. It is also good for all intestinal inflammations. 17 - GINGER—This is good for bringing heat into the system, stimulating digestion, reversing suppressed menstruation, and scanty urine. Internally, it is used for colds, colon spasms, constipation, contagious diseases, coughs, cramps, indigestion, gas, headache, morning sickness, nausea, sinus congestion, and stomach spasms. Externally, it is used for mumps. Add it to laxative formulas to prevent griping. Taken in frequent doses, it will raise body temperature. 18 - MYRRH—This is a strong antiseptic, and works well with goldenseal. Mix them in equal parts. Internally, it is used for asthma, bad breath, boils, cankers, chronic catarrh, colitis, coughs, digestive tonic, bleeding gums, herpes, indigestion, infections, leukorrhea, mouth sores, skin disease, thrush, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for cankers, cuts, bleeding gums, leukorrhea, mouth sores, skin disease, thrush, and wounds. Myrrh destroys putrefaction in the intestines and prevents blood absorption of toxins. It is a good wash for wounds and skin diseases. The powder will dry up most skin problems. It is excellent for most problems involving pus, externally or internally. Do not use it in large amounts over a long period of time. 19 - SKULLCAP—This is very good for almost any nervous problem. Internally, it is used for alcoholism, convulsions, coughs, epilepsy, hysteria, indigestion, insanity, insomnia, nervous tension, and nervous headache. Skullcap has been used to wean people off hard drugs. Combined with ginseng, it is good for alcoholism. Skullcap should be used as fresh as possible, otherwise its activity rather quickly dissipates. 20 - VERVAIN—This is excellent for inducing sweating and to allay fevers (but large amounts will act as an emetic). Internally, it is used for colds, convulsions, coughs, fevers, headaches, measles, nerve weakness, pain in the bowels, and pleurisy. Externally, it is used for rheumatism, neuralgia, sciatica, and swellings of the spleen. Vervain is good for pneumonia, asthma, and other chest diseases. Put the tea on sores, to aid in healing. Use it for colds, flu, coughs, and upper respiratory inflammations. Now you have the basis for a fine, basic herbal cabinet! Twelve or twenty herbs are good numbers to work with, in keeping your basic herb supply small. If you wish, subtract some from the above list, add more from the following list, or change the list around to meet your special needs. Few of us are in a position to keep a large variety of herbs on hand."

herb-basic-herbal-principles,Basic Herbal Principles,"1 - Storage: Herbs are best stored in glass jars. Do not expose them to the sunlight for long periods of time. 2 - Weight factor: Larger persons require larger dosages than smaller or underweight individuals. Women generally require smaller doses than men, due to their lower average weight. Children and elderly people need smaller doses. 3 - Climate: The medicinal effect of herbs is intensified in hot climates, therefore give less at such times. 4 - People vary in their reactions: Some people are more intolerant to herbs than are others. It is best to initially give a smaller dose and see what the effect is going to be. It is always safe to start with the smaller child's dose, then build up to a larger dose if that seems best. Increase slowly, remaining on each level for 2-3 days, to observe for unusual reactions. 5 - Dosage for children: Here is the formula: Divide 150 (the assumed average adult weight) by the child's weight. Example: A child weighs 50 pounds. This is 1/3 of the adult (of 150 pounds.). Therefore give him only a third of the regular dose. 6 - During pregnancy: Women respond to herbs differently when they are pregnant. At such times, it is best to give smaller herbal doses and observe response. Sometimes mild and nutritive herbs are best. Some herbs should not be given during pregnancy (including diuretics, purgatives, and emmenagogues; all of which are active in the pelvic area and should be avoided.) 7 - Nervous people: Give them smaller doses than robust individuals. 8 - High blood pressure: These people should avoid herbs that stimulate the heart or constrict the blood capillaries and arteries (licorice root, ephedra, and lily of the valley are examples). But cayenne and garlic can be used in normal amounts. 9 - When herbs are combined: Herbs are frequently combined; but, if not done properly, one herb may overpower or neutralize the effects of others. 10 - Laxative herbs: Give slow-acting laxatives in the morning, so not to disturb sleep. They may take 1- 3 days to work; whereas fast-acting ones usually take 4-8 hours. Do not increase the dosage until a 3-day period is over, using the same dosage every day. Then, if the desired result is not obtained, you may increase the dosage. The desired objective is generally 2 bowel movements a day. 11 - Sedatives and antispasmodic herbs: Give them on an empty stomach or just before bedtime. 12 - Astringents and minerals: Astringent herbs should not be taken at the same time as nutritional supplements containing iron. The tannins in astringent herbs will leach calcium, iron, and other important minerals out of the intestines. Therefore, only give astringent herbs for a short period of time. 13 - Blood-purifying herbs: Take these herbs on an empty stomach. 14 - Strong, bitter herbs: To avoid nausea, be sure and give enough water with them. 15 - Powerful herbs: Be careful in giving herbs which have powerful effects. These include lobelia, juniper berries, black cohosh, poke root, aconite, and horsetail (shave grass). 16 - Bitter pills: They have a tonic effect on the stomach, digestion, and related organs. 17 - Herbal temperatures: A hot infusion or decoction is used to help induce sweating. Cool teas are used for tonic effect, and warm teas produce a feeling of relaxation. (Vervain is the best for inducing sweating.) 18 - Tablets vs. capsules: Tablets are easier to work with than capsules in hot climates; the latter tend to stick together. Vegetarians either open and empty capsules or use tablets, since capsules are made from slaughterhouse products. 19 - Herbs at mealtime: To avoid taking too much liquid, capsules or tablets are preferable to teas at mealtime. 20 - Varying the intensity of the dosage: Here are several principles to keep in mind:
• For a slow, gradual, general effect, give the herbs in small quantities of syrup or milk
between meals. This will retard absorption.
• To aid the appetite, increase digestive secretions or, for a local effect on stomach or
intestines, give herbs before meals. Give the herbs in acacia gum or olive oil for a localized effect on stomach or intestines.
• To reduce the irritation of certain herbs, give them in syrup or soy milk.
• To increase absorption of the herbs and produce a more rapid effect, give them 1-2 hours
after the meal.
• To reduce the bitter taste of herbs, without reducing the bitterness, take it in a large
quantity of fluid, syrup, or honey. The bitter taste is often necessary for the proper effect to take place, but the bitterness can be disguised to the taste buds.
• Fluids which do not taste good can be taken more easily by drinking them cold, followed
by a drink of plain water. 21 - Weekly rest day: In order for herbs to work best, they should not be taken one day each week. Then, after 2-3 weeks of treatment, no herbs should be taken for 3 days in a row. During this rest period, observe the patient. (1) If his energy remains low during that time or if the symptoms worsen, at the end of the rest period put him back on the herb dosage. (2) If he improves during the rest period, then extend the rest period a day or so and then continue the treatment with smaller doses than were used before. (3) If he seems to completely recover during the rest period, then the treatment can be changed to a more tonic, nutritive, approach. (4) New symptoms or problems may reveal themselves at this time. If so, an herb formula or new therapy should be instituted to meet it. (5) If he seems to get stronger during each rest period, begin reducing therapy and extending the rest periods."
herb-the-preparation-of-herbs,The Preparation Of Herbs,"1 - Infusion: Pour one pint of boiling water over one ounce of dried herbs and let it stand for a half hour. Strain off clear liquid. Dose is normally 1 tablespoon to a teacup, 3 times a day. But doses can vary. 2 - Decoction: Place one ounce of dried herbs in 1½ pints of cold water and boil for 20-30 minutes. Strain off clear liquid. Dose is 1 tablespoon to 1 ounce of water, 3 times a day. 3 - Tincture: 1-2 ounces dried herbs are steeped in one pint of grain alcohol (brandy or vodka) for 2 days with vigorous shaking 3 times a day. The decoction is strained and 1 tablespoon of the clear liquid is used, 3 times a day. 4 - Capsule: The dry herbs are powdered and then placed in a 2-piece gelatin capsule. The capsule may be added to hot water for tea; opened and made into a paste for poultices, tinctures, decoctions, infusions; or swallowed. 5 - Tablet: The dried herb is pressed into a tablet shape with an excipient (binder or carrier). The tablet can be used in the same way as a capsule."
herb-nine-useful-poultices,Nine Useful Poultices,"1 - Cabbage poultice: Pulverize the leaves and lay it on the skin. This will draw out poisons and pus. When it feels hot, replace it with a fresh one. 2 - Garlic poultice: Crush fresh garlic and add warm water and flour. It relieves pain, pus, and infection. 3 - Potato poultice: Place grated raw potato on bruises, sprains, or boils. 4 - Comfrey poultice: Mash the leaves, then moisten them with comfrey tea. It is good for open sores, wounds, or swellings. 5 - Fig poultice: Heat figs for 3 minutes, cut open, and apply to infected sores. It will bring them to a head. 6 - Oatmeal poultice: Cook oatmeal, cool, then place in a soft, cotton cloth. Put it over inflammations and insect bites, and cover with a dry cloth. Apply a heating pad. 7 - Carrot poultice: Take the pulp remaining after juicing carrots (or finely grate carrots), and place it on bruises, sores, chapped skin, and nipples. 8 - Tofu poultice: Squeeze out the cake, chop it up, add a teaspoon of ginger, then flour till it thickens. This will draw out inflammation and fever. 9 - Clay poultice: Get clay from a place where it is found and sterilize it in the oven. Or buy it at the health food store (either regular clay or bentonite clay). Mix the clay with just enough water or herb tea to make a consistency that is thick, like bread dough. Apply to bruises and infections. Mix clay with crushed cabbage leaves, and place the mixture on boils or tumors. Mix clay with cayenne or ginger and apply to sore arthritic joints."
herb-the-healing-crisis,The Healing Crisis,"Physicians and laymen have known about the healing crisis for thousands of years. During the healing process, the body tries to throw off toxins and poisons. What is known as the ""healing crisis"" frequently occurs in illnesses. The body seems overwhelmed with all the toxins and wastes it is trying to throw off. The organs of elimination (bowels, kidneys, lungs, skin, nasal passages, throat, bronchi, and urinary organs) become congested, crowded, and irritated. During this crisis, that which appears to be disease symptoms appear. These may be open sores, perspiration, diarrhea, boils, colds, kidney and bladder infections, fevers, etc. But this is not a new, or intensified, disease—it is just part of the healing process. The body knows it must eliminate the wastes before it can begin rebuilding, so it works valiantly to do this. Physicians sometimes try to stop the process by introducing poisons (drugs) into the system. Immediately, the body stops throwing off wastes—stops the crisis—and turns its attention to the terrible new invader. The body may appear to be resting quietly now, with the symptoms reduced or gone; but, in actuality, it has been prostrated by the drugging. Let us now return to a healing crisis and its symptoms. They are part of the cure, and should not be feared. Just work with the body, to help eliminate those toxic wastes. Open the channels of elimination by means of drinking water and fruit juices, fasting, enemas, colonics, showers, baths, and water treatments. Sometimes the pain becomes severe during the crisis. Drugs taken in earlier years are being pulled out of the tissues in an effort to discard. The damage of many years is being righted. The body arouses itself in self-defense and brings forth acute elimination of toxins in the form of a fever, cold, inflammations, itching, boils, ulcers, hemorrhages, excessive menstrual discharge, etc. Reactions vary, in accordance with how the person has been living and the condition of the body. But sometimes this sudden turn in an illness is not a healing crisis, but a change for the worse in a disease. It is important to be able to tell the difference. Consider this:
• Watch the person carefully, as you work earnestly to help him eliminate toxins (water,
juices, enemas, sweating, baths, etc.) If not watched properly and helped, the crisis can be extended and his energies weakened.
• If it is a healing crisis, you will generally see a positive change—a change for the
better—after three days. The most severe symptoms begin to decrease. Fevers break. The person becomes more relaxed and begins to feel better.
• But if, after three days, the symptoms do not change for the better, then a new course of
treatment must be started. However, if the person has low energy and vitality, the crisis may take three to seven days.
• If the individual has a strong constitution and the organs of elimination are working well
and are being helped, he may recover without having undergone a healing crisis. Are there ways to tell when a healing crisis is about to begin? Certain symptoms will intensify, such as sluggishness, fevers, dark urine, coated tongue, weakness, irritability, headaches, and ringing in the ears. When you see these signs, immediately set to work to help the person's system cleanse more fully. Herbs, massage, water therapy treatments, and enemas can help him through this time. If no poisons were introduced into the system (in an effort to block the healing crisis) the person will generally keep improving. Right living, right eating, and rest can bring healing. Additional healing crises may occur before the patient is fully recovered. Each one will generally be milder, only one to three days in length, and be followed by a new level of feeling better. The intensity of the crisis will depend on how ill the person was. The nature of the crisis will be keyed to where the illness is centered in his body and how easily he can throw off the poisons. If the wastes can be eliminated through normal pathways, a fever will develop to burn it out or store it as boils and acne. If the mucous is thick, there will be nasal drip, colds, flu, etc. Constipation may precede diarrhea; lung congestion may come before a respiratory crisis. Sometimes we feel pain in our kidneys, bladder, or bowels and imagine it is a disease. But, in fact, often the body has selected the strongest organ of elimination to throw off unwanted and excess wastes. When the crisis is over, the body needs help rebuilding itself. But, throughout the sickness and recovery, never go to extremes in diet. Carry on with a gradual transition back to regular living. Trying to make the system too pure too fast can overly weaken the patient. Work carefully, keep praying for guidance; and, if the patient fully cooperates, all will go well."
herb-water-therapy-principles,Water Therapy Principles,"It would be well to include instruction here on how to give simple water treatments; but, like herbal lore, it cannot be properly covered in a few pages. The present author wrote a 290-page book, entitled The Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), which nicely covers the subject. You may obtain a copy, as long as they are available. Here are but a few of the many water therapy principles:
• It is the heat and cold of the water that produces the results. Neutral temperatures are
good for relaxing the person, but they do not produce the powerful effects that hot and cold can give.
• Water is capable of absorbing and storing a larger amount of heat than nearly any other
substance on earth; that is, it has a high specific heat. This means that, when water is applied to the body (in a cloth, bath, shower, etc.), it will impart more heat (or cold) than any other substance at the same temperature.
• In its effects, ice is far colder than its temperature of 32o F., and steam is far hotter than
212o F. (Keep in mind that steam can burn.)
• Water must be in contact with the body for awhile in order to impart heat or cold. But it
only need contact it for a moment to give a thermic impression that can be quite strong. For example, plunge your arm for only a moment into a pail of very cold water. It was only there for a moment, but the effect on the circulating blood in the arm will be powerful. This is thermic impression, and it is very important. You do not have to cool the body with lengthy cold in order to have it react strongly to that cold.
• Water is the world's greatest solvent. It can cleanse better than anything else. It can
remove wastes. But it can also hold nutrients placed within it for the body to absorb.
• Neither infants nor aged persons bear cold treatment well. Some chill after almost any
kind of cold application. Remember that they are only being helped if they react well to the cold application. If they do not, then they are not being helped. Conditions which do not react well to cold would include anemia, emaciation, asthenia, extreme thinness, etc. If a person cannot be benefited by cold, then apply mild heat instead. Always keep the feet warm.
• The body should be warm before the cold is applied. He should become warm afterward.
Exercise, friction, percussion—all help bring a good reaction. Hot given beforehand to warm the body also aids it. You may need to apply hot to the feet before the cold is given, and, if need be, afterward also.
• The cold treatment should be given quickly. As soon as it is completed, quickly dry him.
Friction as he is rubbed with the towel, or afterward, will also help warm him. He must be dried very quickly and well. Dry him in a warm room, near where the last cold application was given. Have his clothes all ready for him to put on. This requires advance planning. Carelessness after the cold can undo all the value that could have been gained from it.
• By alternating the hot and cold applications, the beneficial properties of both may be
obtained without many of the disadvantages of either. As you become acquainted with the many water therapies given in the author's book, The Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), you will notice that they tend to do one or more of six things:
• Bring blood to an afflicted part. This will frequently be an area closer to the surface and
outside of the trunk.
• Pull blood from a deeper internal organ to the skin just above it. This deeper, congested,
area is often in the trunk, and the hot application (or a cold-to-heating application) was placed on the skin just above that organ.
• Draw blood away from a deeper, congested, organ by placing the application, not on the
skin just above the internal organ,—but on a reflex area somewhere else on the body.
• Pull blood from the internal organ to a distant body part (usually the legs and/or
feet—best both). This is called derivation, and is frequently done at the same time that an application is made just above the internal organ (or to a reflex area connected to it by nerves), to also pull blood away from that congested organ.
• A proximal compress, consisting of a cold application, may be placed on an extremity.
An example would be an ice compress around the neck. This will greatly reduce the amount of blood flowing into the head.
• A full application to most of the body to relieve congestion, equalize the circulation, and
bring warmth from that application (a hot pack, apply heat) or by reaction to it (a heating compress, applying cold for the body to heat). There are many additional guiding principles involved in the use of water therapy. Water is a most precious gift from God. Make good use of it, in both sickness and in health. HYDRO—When HYDRO is shown at the beginning of a paragraph, it refers to water treatments in the author's hydrotherapy book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet). In case you do not have that book, the name of the water treatments are given. But page numbers are also cited, so you can learn more about how to give these applications if you have that book. Only a very small sampling of the water treatments described in that book are mentioned in this one. Many more could have been included, but this present book would have become too large."
herb-the-use-of-drugs,The Use Of Drugs,"The following analysis of the nature and effects of medicinal drug medication is taken from the writings of Ellen G. White, an influential author and worker in the field of health and natural healing. She was also the founder of a major medical college. ""Drugs never cure disease; they only change its form and location . . When drugs are introduced into the system, for a time they seem to have a beneficial effect. A change may take place, but the disease is not cured. It will manifest itself in some other form . . The disease which the drug was given to cure may disappear, but only to reappear in a new form, such as skin diseases, ulcers, painful diseased joints, and sometimes in a more dangerous and deadly form . . Nature keeps struggling, and the patient suffers with different ailments, until there is a sudden breaking down in her efforts, and death follows.""—How to Live, 60. ""Although the patient may recover, yet the powerful effort nature was required to make to overcome the poison, injured the constitution and shortened the life of the patient. There are many who do not die under the influence of drugs, but there are very many who are left useless wrecks, hopeless, gloomy, and miserable sufferers, a burden to themselves and to society.""—How to Live, 50. ""Every additional drug given to the patient . . will complicate the case, and make the patient's recovery more hopeless . . An evil, simple in the beginning, which nature aroused herself to overcome, and which she would have done if left to herself, aided by the common blessings of Heaven, has been made tenfold worse by introducing drug poisons into the system, which cause of themselves a destructive disease, forcing into extraordinary action the remaining life forces to war against and overcome the drug intruder.""—How to Live, 57. ""There are more who die from the use of drugs than all who would have died of disease had nature been left to do her own work.""—How to Live, 61. ""The endless variety of medicines in the market, the numerous advertisements of new drugs and mixtures, all of which claim to do wonderful cures, kill hundreds where they benefit one . . Yet people keep dosing, and continue to grow weaker until they die . . God's servants should not administer medicines which they know will leave behind injurious effects upon the system, even if they do relieve present suffering. Every poisonous preparation in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, taken into the system, will leave its wretched influence, affecting the liver and lungs, and deranging the system generally.""—Facts of Faith, 140. ""Educate away from drugs, use them less and less, and spend more and more upon hygienic agencies. Nature will respond to God's remedies,—pure air, pure water, proper exercise, and a clear conscience.""—Letter, 1888. ""A great amount of good can be done by enlightening all to whom we have access, as to the best means, not only of curing the sick, but of preventing disease and suffering. The physician who endeavors to enlighten his patients as to the nature and causes of their maladies, and to teach them how to avoid disease, may have up-hill work; but if he is a conscientious reformer, he will talk plainly of the ruinous effects of self-indulgence in eating, drinking, and dressing, of the overtaxation of the vital forces that has brought his patients where they are. He will not increase the evil by administering drugs till exhausted nature gives up the struggle, but will teach the patients how to form correct habits and to aid nature in her work of restoration by a wise use of her own remedies.""—Christian Temperance, 121. ""In treating the sick, the physician will seek God for wisdom; then, instead of placing his dependence upon drugs and expecting that medicine will bring health to his patients, he will use nature's restoratives, and employ natural means whereby the sick may be aided to recover.""—Healthful Living, 247-248. ""Let the instruction be given in simple words [such as hot water, charcoal, or catnip tea]. We have no need to use the many expressions used by worldly physicians which are so difficult to understand that they must be interpreted by physicians . . Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs.""—Letter 82, 1908. ""Were I sick, I would just as soon call in a lawyer as a physician from among general practitioners. I would not touch their nostrums, to which they give Latin names. I am determined to know, in straight English, the name of everything that I introduce into my system.""—Manuscript 86, 1897. ""Indulging in eating too frequently, and in too large quantities, overtaxes the digestive organs and produces a feverish state of the system. The blood becomes impure, and then diseases of various kinds occur. A physician is sent for, who prescribes some drug which gives present relief, but which does not cure the disease. It may change the form of the disease, but the real evil is increased ten-fold. Nature was doing her best to rid the system of an accumulation of impurities, and should she have been left to herself, aided by the common blessings of heaven, such as pure air and pure water, a speedy and safe cure could have been affected.""—4 Spiritual Gifts, 133. ""Use nature's remedies,—water, sunshine, and fresh air. Do not use drugs. Drugs never heal; they only change the features of the disease.""—Letter 116, 1903. ""Experimenting in drugs is a very expensive business . . Nothing should be put into the human system that will leave a baleful influence behind.""—Medical Ministry, 228. ""Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs. They destroy the power of the patient to help himself. This power the patients are to be taught to exercise by learning to eat simple, healthful foods, by refusing to overload the stomach with a variety of foods at one meal. All these things should come into the education of the sick. Talks should be given showing how to preserve health, how to shun sickness, how to rest when rest is needed.""—Letter 82, 1908. ""Christ's remedies cleanse the system. But Satan has tempted man to introduce into the system that which weakens the human machinery, clogging and destroying the fine, beautiful arrangements of God. The drugs administered to the sick do not restore, but destroy. Drugs never cure. Instead, they place in the system seeds which bear a very bitter harvest.""—2 Selected Messages, 289. ""Thousands need to be educated patiently, kindly, tenderly, but decidedly, that nine-tenths of their complaints are created by their own course of action. The more they introduce drugs into the system, the more certainly do they interfere with the laws of nature and bring about the very difficulties they drug themselves to avoid.""—Letter 22, 1889. ""Instead of taking a course to baffle disease, you are petting it and yielding to its power. You should avoid the use of drugs and carefully observe the laws of health. If you regard your life, you should eat plain food, prepared in the simplest manner, and take more physical exercise. Each member of the family needs the benefit of health reform. But drugging should be forever abandoned. For while it does not cure any malady, it enfeebles the system, making it more susceptible to disease.""—5 Testimonies, 311. ""If those who take these drugs were alone the sufferers, the evil would not be as great. But parents not only sin against themselves in swallowing drug-poisons, but they sin against their children. The vitiated state of their blood, the poison distributed throughout the system, the broken constitutions and various drug diseases, as the result of drug poisons, are transmitted to their offspring, and left them as a wretched inheritance, which is another great cause of the degeneracy of the race.""—How to Live, 53. Principles of Health Part 4a First Law of Health - Air"
herb-the-air-you-breathe,The Air You Breathe,"The year was 1875; the place, Paris, France. For more than two years, three scientists had worked toward this day, and now they were ready. Carefully, they climbed into the gondola of the balloon, ""Zenith,"" while thousands around them watched. Determined to set a new altitude record, they wanted to go higher than man had ever risen above the earth. And they did just that,—but at what a cost. Slowly the large balloon rose into the air, with its human cargo of three men in a basket-shaped gondola swinging just beneath it. All seemed well; they were well on their way toward the goal: to climb higher than any man had ever gone. Then at 24,430 feet it happened. Tissandier, one of the three, later described it: ""Croce is gasping for breath, Sivel is dazed, but can still cut three sandbags loose in order to reach 26,240 feet."" At that point, Tissandier himself was overcome and slumped to the floor, losing consciousness. Some time afterward, as the balloon—freed from the sandbags continued its ascent—he awoke. They had attained a height of 8,600 meters (approximately 28,000 feet)—but two of the scientists lay dead in the gondola of the balloon. Yes, they had conquered the heights, but before it was done the heights had conquered them. There was not enough air, with its precious life-giving oxygen, to sustain life at that great altitude. Without air, man dies. Air is the most vital element for man and animals. One may live for weeks without food, or for days without water, but deprived of air he will perish within minutes.

The problem is that most people do not breathe correctly, and this continually weakens their"

principle-maintaining-health,Maintaining Health,"What are the basic principles of right living, to ensure the best health you can have with the limitations imposed by the body you have? Here are 120 principles of healthful living. Many more could be mentioned:"
principle-basic-principles-of-health,Basic Principles Of Health,"1 - Regularity in meals. Do not eat them early or late, but maintain a regular schedule. Your stomach is used to eating at certain times each day. 2 - Moderation. Only eat as much as you need. Never overeat. Only eat to satisfy hunger, and then stop. 3 - Take small bites. Only put a small amount in your mouth at a time. You will chew and salivate it better, and tend to eat less at that meal. 4 - Relax and eat slowly. If you are too rushed to eat, then do not eat. Do not be hurried, anxious, worried, fatigued, or angry. 5 - Chew your food well. You will derive far more energy out of less food, if you do this. 6 - Do not eat too many things at a meal. Three or four items (plus a little salt, oil, etc.) are all you need. 7 - Avoid complicated mixtures. Say no to the gravies, vegetable loaves, gluten foods, and all the rest. Keep your meal simple. 8 - Avoid peculiar additives, such as vinegar, monosodium glutamate, etc., which only upset your stomach and slow digestion. 9 - Vary your diet from meal to meal. If you ate oatmeal this morning, try rye or wheat tomorrow. 10 - The food should be palatable. But if it is good food, this should not be hard to do. 11 - Never eat anything prepared in aluminum. Never drink water or juice out of an aluminum container. Alzheimer's is worth avoiding. 12 - Aside from fresh, raw, juices or the green drink, drink all your liquids (water) between meals, not with your meals. 13 - As a rule, eat your fruits at one meal and vegetables at another. Acid fruits (such as citrus) can be eaten with either. 14 - Greens have more compacted vitamins and minerals than other type of food. They only lack vitamin D, which the body can get from sunlight. But they do not have adequate amounts of trace minerals. 15 - Nova Scotia dulse and Norwegian kelp (two types of seaweed) are the only rich source of trace minerals. 16 - Blackstrap molasses is the only very rich source of iron. It is also a very rich source of choline and inositol, the two B vitamins used in the largest quantities. 17 - The best pattern is to rest before the meal, and walk around after it, not vice versa."
principle-fruits,Fruits,"1 - The more natural, the better. Raw fruits and vegetables are better than cooked ones, although some find that a little cooking is necessary. Store-bought canned goods are even less nutritious. 2 - Wash the fruit before eating it. 3 - Do not eat melons, cantaloupes, and watermelons with other foods; eat them alone. 4 - Always soak dried fruit (prunes, apricots, etc.) before eating them. 5 - Never eat sulphured fruit. It may be golden in color, but the sulphur is not good inside of you."
principle-vegetables,Vegetables,"1 - The best is fresh, raw, vegetable juice, made from carrots, with some beets, and possibly some celery. This is made in a vegetable juicing machine. It is one of the most valuable appliances you can purchase. Use it every day. The juice is best drunk fresh, within a couple minutes of making it. But, when you know you will be away from home that day, make it in the morning and drink it later as part of a sack lunch. 2 - Also good is the ""green drink."" This is pineapple juice with some greens whizzed in and is made in a food blender. 3 - Some people's digestive systems cannot tolerate a diet of totally raw vegetables. Each must do that which works best for him. 4 - Eat largely of raw vegetables, with possibly some steamed. A good way to cook vegetables is to keep records on the amount of water used and the time it takes to cook the vegetables, so all the water is gone. For example, broccoli can be lightly cooked for 15 minutes or softer in 30. Find how much water is required to do this, and only have a very small amount of water left in the pan at the end of that time. 5 - Never pour off the vegetable water! Make it part of the meal. For this reason, prepare the food so that very little of the water remains (not over an eighth of a cup) when the cooking is finished. Then drink that water during the meal. Other than the cooking water and a glass of fresh juice, drink no other liquids with the meal. 6 - Beets, potatoes, and squash are excellent foods. Cut out the growing eyes of the white potatoes, but otherwise do not peel them! The outer half inch of the white potato is rich in potassium and is the best part. 7 - All the greens are outstanding, but avoid too much spinach; it is higher in oxalic acid. Enjoy broccoli, Brussel sprouts, celery, kale, collards, beet greens, turnip greens, mustard greens, and some lettuce. The deeper the greenness, the more vitamins and minerals it has. (By the way, never eat rhubarb; it is terribly high in oxalic acid which leaches calcium from your bones.) 8 - Fiber is very important in the diet, for the bowels and the arteries. It can protect you from intestinal problems and heart disease. Oat bran is the best, but whole grains and other vegetable and fruit roughage is very helpful."
principle-grains,Grains,"1 - Only eat whole grains. This includes whole-grain cereals and breads. Never eat processed grains, such as white-flour products. 2 - If you can eat wheat (many cannot), make zwieback of your bread. Place the slices in the oven and toast them until firm, but not rock-hard. This dextrinizes the starch and renders it more digestible. 3 - Avoid toasted wheat germ, for the oils in it will be rancid. Raw wheat germ should be stored in the refrigerator at the health food store and in your own refrigerator, when you arrive home. It should smell very fresh. 4 - Oats is one of the best grains. Rye, millet, and buckwheat are also. If you are out on the road and want to have a grain with you which is easily obtained, can be eaten as it is, and is very nourishing, eat Cheerios. Make sure it was recently purchased. Many people are allergic to wheat and products made with wheat. 5 - You are better off having a varied grain diet rather than just rice. Yet rice is a very good food. Make sure it is unpolished (brown rice). 6 - Chew each bite of grain products very well before swallowing. Digestion of starches begins in the mouth."
principle-nuts-and-seeds,Nuts And Seeds,"1 - The nuts and seeds you eat should be fresh. Rancid oil and decaying protein are not good for you. 2 - Nuts, seeds, nut butters, seed butters, and peanut butter are very rich in protein and should only be eaten sparingly. Chew these foods very well. This breaks the food down so the amino acids will be better processed by the stomach acid. 3 - Most commercial peanut butter has the peanut oil removed, and cheap oils in its place. These oils are generally hydrogenated, and thus even more dangerous. Never use peanut butter which does not have floating oil on the top and does not smell fresh."
principle-fats,Fats,"According to your body's needs, use little or no added oil. But you do need vitamin F (the essential unsaturated fatty acids). The best sources are flaxseed oil and wheat germ oil; second-best are sunflower seed oil, soy oil, and corn oil. Never use cottonseed oil. Safflower oil is not as good as some believe."
principle-sweetening,Sweetening,"1 - For your sweetening, only use fresh fruit, dried fruit, a little honey, or blackstrap molasses. 2 - If you want the best, eat a small amount of blackstrap at the end of your meal. It will fill your sweet tooth, is the richest natural source of iron, and one of the richest in calcium and several important B vitamins."
principle-other-nutrients,Other Nutrients,"1 - Salt. Some say that all the salt you need is in the food, but that may or may not be true. You may need to add a little salt, but do not add very much. The best way is to put no salt in the cooking; then add a slight amount of salt to the food at the table. Pour a little into the palm of your hand and sprinkle it where you want it. In this way you will get the exact small amount you need, and no more. 2 - The type of salt to use: Regular store-bought, free-flowing salt has aluminum in it. If you cannot do better, buy iodized salt at the store (never non-iodized). Better yet, buy a non-free-flowing salt. It will cake somewhat (salt attracts moisture). Even better, use dulse or kelp! 3 - Nova Scotia dulse comes from western Canada. By checking around, you can locate a food source. This is an outstanding source of trace minerals—including iodine, as well as of common salt (sodium chloride). Eat only enough to satisfy your salt intake needs,—and you will have supplied all your iodine and trace mineral requirements as well. Norwegian kelp is an alternate. California kelp is not as good. 4 - Certain kitchen herbs are helpful; and, when used in small amounts, they can be used to flavor foods. This would include sage, dill, garlic powder, dried parsley, thyme, fennel seed, celery seed, oregano, marjoram, summer savory, basil, rosemary, and ginger. 5 - Cayenne is a very useful medicinal herb; but, if used more than a very little at mealtime, this can lead to pleurisy."
principle-vitamins-and-minerals,Vitamins And Minerals,"Here is a brief introduction to principles concerning the use of vitamins and minerals. 1 - Always take a full vitamin/mineral supplement with every main meal. Buy them from a source you are sure is supplying you with new stock, that has not been on a room temperature shelf for a month or two. Keep the bottle in the refrigerator until it is used. 2 - Vitamin A: Unless you are ill and need it right away, use a carotene source, not vitamin A. Because it is an oil-soluble vitamin, over a period of time, you can get too much vitamin A. 3 - Vitamin B complex: The complete B complex contains a dozen or so different, related, vitamins. Make sure you are getting them all in your supplement(s). These are water soluble, so you can never get too much of them. 4 - Vitamin C: Ascorbic acid by itself is not as useful as many believe. Take a ""total C"" formula, which also contains bioflavonoids (vitamin P). You will pay a little more, but it is worth it. It is also water soluble, so you cannot take too much. (If you oversaturate on C, the excess will be excreted through the bowels as a brief diarrhea. This will tell you that, just then, you have taken a little more than your body needs. This is what it means to take vitamin C ""to bowel tolerance."") 5 - Vitamin D: Do not take animal or fish liver oil; it can damage your heart muscle. Instead, go out in the sunlight every so often and you will get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D is oil soluble and is the most dangerous vitamin. It is vital that you have some of this for your bones, but you do not want too much. 6 - Vitamin E: Make sure your vitamin E supplement says ""tocopherols,"" not ""tocopheryls"" which is synthetic and worthless. Do not rely on a multivitamin supplement for vitamin E. Take vitamin E capsules, either 200 or 400 IU per capsule. Although it is oil soluble, the possibility of overdosing is rare in the extreme. 7 - Vitamin F: This is your essential fatty acids, which is best obtained from the flaxseed oil or wheat germ oil, mentioned earlier. 8 - The most important minerals are calcium, potassium, magnesium, iodine, zinc, selenium, and manganese. Avoid phosphorus supplements. Your body always gets all the phosphorus it needs in the food you eat; too much locks with calcium and causes your bones to become weak. 9 - Most people need a calcium supplement. Take half a spoonful of powdered calcium twice or three times a day. Do not use a calcium supplement which has phosphorus in it. 10 - Be careful about iron supplements. They are generally not good for you. Especially avoid them during pregnancy! Use blackstrap instead. 11 - What about the capsules? They are made from animals from the slaughterhouse, generally pigs. If it is a split capsule, open and pour it into a spoon. If it is a sealed capsule, crack it in your mouth and spit out the capsule."
principle-summary,Summary,"In summary, some of the best foods for you to eat are these: 1 - Fresh, raw, fruits. You may also wish to make some fresh, raw fruit juice. 2 - Fresh, raw, vegetables and, possibly, some moderately cooked vegetables prepared in a small amount of water, all of which will be used in the meal. 3 - Fresh, raw, vegetable juices made from carrots, beets, and possibly some celery. This drink is outstanding! Green drink (pineapple juice and greens) made in a blender is also good. 4 - Beets, potatoes, and squash are excellent foods. Do not peel white potatoes. 5 - Whole grain cereals or bread toasted in the oven into zwieback. Chew starches extra well. 6 - Add some supplemental fiber to your diet. You will be thankful later that you did. Fiber will help your digestive tract, colon, liver, heart, and blood vessels. 7 - A few fresh nuts and seeds, chewed extra well. Brewer's yeast is another good protein source; so are beans. White potatoes are low in protein, but they are very well-assimilated. 8 - A good vitamin/mineral supplement, vitamin E capsules, calcium, plus other nutrients as needed. Each person will have special needs. 9 - Eat some kelp or dulse each day for iodine and other trace minerals. You do well to use it instead of salt. 10 - Drink pure water, and only between meals. 11 - Should you use milk and/or eggs? Each one will have to decide that for himself. Both are known to frequently be contaminated with disease germs. Yet some need the blood-building properties in these products. It is well-known that more people are allergic to cow's milk or wheat than anything else. It is best if you can work away from using them. 12 - Do not eat very much. Be relaxed and thankful, chew your food well; and, aside from the fresh juices or green drink, drink all your liquids (water) between meals."
principle-things-to-avoid,Things To Avoid,"""Avoid"" means do not use at all. 1 - Avoid sugar and sugar foods. This is food which has added corn syrup, glucose, or other sugar additives in it. Many canned and processed foods are sugar foods. Do not eat candy. 2 - Do not use white sugar, granulated sugar, or brown sugar. 3 - Avoid spices and condiments which cause stomach upset and worse. This would include black pepper, white pepper, cinnamon, and mustard. 4 - Avoid grease. Grease remains firm at room temperature, and includes Crisco, butter, margarine, and all meat fat. 5 - Avoid hydrogenated oils. An atom of hydrogen has been added to them; so, like grease, they can only be used to coat your arteries and produce fat cells. 6 - Do not use fried foods. Anything fried in oil should be avoided. Your life is too important. 7 - Avoid rich gravies, pastries, ice cream, and all the other delicacies. 8 - Avoid white-flour products: cookies, biscuits, sour bread, bagels, doughnuts, soda crackers, etc. Avoid the glue foods. Along with cheese, these are the sticky, white-flour stuff which is hard on your intestinal tract 9 - Avoid processed foods. This includes a wide variety of ""food"" which you will find in the store. 10 - Do not eat cheese. In order to normalize your intestinal flora, you may need a little plain yogurt for a time. 11 - Do not eat baker's yeast. This is fresh bread yeast. (Brewer's yeast and torula yeast is all right.) 12 - Avoid junk food and no-food. This includes soft drinks, cola drinks, potato chips, corn chips, and all the rest. Do not drink non-caffeinated soft drinks. 13 - Do not eat vinegar or foods made with it (pickles and mayonnaise). 14 - Never eat meat or fish! They are heavily contaminated with bacteria, parasites, dangerous fat, and uric acid (urine). As soon as they are slain, the flesh begins rotting. 15 - Avoid the food additives. You will find them listed on the labels of most all processed foods at the store. They lead to arthritic, cardiac, and cancer problems. 16 - Many people are allergic to cow's milk; you may be one of them. Every public health officer knows that meat and milk are the two most contaminated and diseased foods in the country. Eggs rank close behind them. It is best to avoid them also. 17 - Do not use caffeine products. This includes chocolate, coffee, China tea (also called black tea), and caffeinated drinks, such as Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola. 18 - Do not use nicotine products. Tobacco is responsible for an astonishing number of deaths in our world today. Avoid side smoke; do not be in rooms where people are smoking. Chewing snuff causes cancer of the mouth and throat. 19 - Do not drink spiritous liquors: beer, wine, whiskey, or vodka. 20 - Do not use hard (street) drugs. 21 - Avoid medicinal drugs, to whatever extent that you can. Careful living and eating will generally help you avoid having to take them. 22 - Find the foods and other substances you are allergic to, and avoid them. The most common allergenic foods are cow's milk and wheat products."
principle-non-dietetic-factors,Non-Dietetic Factors,"1 - Obtain fresh air during the day and while sleeping at night. A slight current of air should pass through your sleeping room at night. When you have the opportunity to go outside, breathe deeply of the fresh air. Practice good posture at certain times. Negative ions are important for good health, and they are primarily outside the house. 2 - Sunlight is important. Get a little every day. There is a higher rate of breast cancer in localities where there is less sunlight. 3 - Exercise is important; and, as everybody says, walking outside is the best way to get it. If you are going to do vigorous exercise, warm up first. Do some vigorous walking every day. 4 - Rest is of vital consequence. As you grow older, try to rest a little before preparing the meal. Then, when the meal is over, go outside and walk around a little. 5 - Do not do heavy reading or study just before bedtime, or your brain will be congested and it will be harder to go to sleep. Instead, go outside and walk around in the cool night air, breathing deeply. You will more easily drop right off to sleep. 6 - Maintain a cheerful, sunny, thankful, contented attitude. This is a powerful health-building recipe. 7 - Trust in God; He is the only One who can help you through the problems and trials of life. 8 - You need periods of rest and relaxation every so often. Purposive living, when the objective is to help others, is powerful for good—and excellent for your health. But do not overwork. 9 - Cleanliness is important. Keep your yard clean, your house clean, your clothes clean, and your body clean. Wash the outside with water (take a shower every day), and wash the inside by drinking enough liquids. At certain times, take an enema or colonic when needed, especially when you are sick. Showers are generally better than tub baths; they are quicker and more sanitary. 10 - Do not wear belts, corsets, garters. The clothes should be supported from the shoulders, not at the waist. Men should wear suspenders as part of the way to avoid later prostate problems. 11 - The right exercise of the will is crucial. You are well, you become well, you resist disease, you choose not the wrong, and choose to do the right—through the power of the will, strengthened by firm reliance on God and obedience to His Written Word. 12 - As much as possible, live on a scheduled routine. In this way, you will get your meals, water, rest, exercise, and fresh air. You will have time to eat, to think, and make right decisions. Maintaining regular hours is a great benefit to health. Avoid staying up late at night! Use your will and go to bed when you are supposed to. 13 - Avoid chilling or overheating. Avoid drafts. The danger is in chilling or overheating the blood; either can cause trouble. Dress properly; keep the limbs covered. They should be as warm as the trunk. 14 - Fast occasionally. Skip a meal and just drink fruit or vegetable juice instead. If you are in good health, you can carry on your work on a lighter load till the next meal. If you are frail, go to bed and rest. This will do you wonders in rebuilding and strengthening your body, so you will avoid later development of chronic and degenerative diseases. 15 - Keep your blood circulation equalized. Do not chill the extremities. Do not overeat or eat wrong foods. Maintain moderate exercise. Do what it takes to live right, and you will be richly rewarded. 16 - Avoid anger, fear, worry, and enervation. An excellent way to ruin yourself is by indulging in excess sex or forbidden sex. Happiness comes through self-control, not indulgence. 17 - Never overdo your immune system. It protects you, only as you do not make it work too hard in the process. 18 - Do not overwork one body part more than the others. Many occupational injuries occur because this rule is violated. Take time to rest, when you are not busily working. Look a little closer at athletes, boxers, and karate experts. They are usually physically damaged in their joints by the time they are 50. This is not necessary. Live well by living moderately. Too much food, too much work, and too much relaxation can each be a problem. Learn to balance it all. 19 - Have a careful attitude. Avoid falls, blows, hazards, and dangerous activities. More quadriplegia occurs from diving into shallow water than any other single cause. Get extra rest when you work near sick people. 20 - Learn the distant early warning signs. What are the first indications that you are headed toward sickness? Find out what they are—for yourself, your loved ones, and your children. When you see trouble coming, get extra rest; retire earlier. Skip a meal or two, go to bed and fast on water and lemon juice. 21 - Automobiles are one of the most dangerous things in Western civilization. Treat them with care; avoid them as much as you can. Aside from gluttony, tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, they can maim or kill you faster than most anything in your environment. If you are trying to live healthfully, they are your primary danger of crippling or premature death. Drive carefully, always a distance from the car in front of you. Also be watchful of any situation in which cars are turning in or out. Twilight times, evenings, and night are the most dangerous. 22 - When able to do so, avoid jet lag and traveling in foreign countries. They have different intestinal bacteria, and you can surely get sick over there. 23 - Avoid loud sounds, such as chain saws and other loud machinery. Wear ear protectors. 24 - Avoid dust, smoke, and chemical vapors. 25 - Move out to the country, if you want the best of health! Away from the noise, the fumes, the rush and turmoil. Out to where there is quietness, peace, fresh air, negative ions, and better sunlight. 26 - Do not live in the lowlands, by a creek. Do not live where it is always damp around the house. Settle in an upper area where it tends to be drier. 27 - Do not have trees close to your house. Do not have your windows covered up with curtains; let the sunlight come through. It purifies every room it enters. Skylight is purifying also, but lesser so. 28 - Vegetable, fruit, berry, and flower gardening is an outstanding way to maintain your health—in several ways. But avoid using chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and other garden chemicals. 29 - Learn how to give water therapy (hydrotherapy) treatments. Learn how to prepare and use simple herbs. Keep a few on hand. As we try to help others, our own health improves."
