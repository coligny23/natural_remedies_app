Do not drink cow's milk. Do not smoke (if you do, do not expect the ulcer\nto heal properly).\n• A diet high in sugar increases HCl production.

But this approach is being discarded.\n• It is now known that the calcium in milk only stimulates acid production rather than\ndecreasing it, as was taught for years. (Milk does initially neutralize HCl, but the calcium\ntriggers gastrin, which causes the walls to excrete more HCl.)\n• In addition, it is now known that sipping milk and cream can lead to myocardial infarcts\n(heart attacks). The problem seems to be the butter fat in the sippy diet.\n• The bland diet approach is also being discarded because those foods neither relieve pain\nnor speed healing. So, instead, eat whatever good food works best for you.\n• Potatoes are very helpful. They are soothing and have an alkaline reaction.\n• Vitamin U is the anti-ulcer vitamin.

Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers\noccurring in the top part of the small intestine. However causes and treatment are essentially the same.\nThese ulcers can be caused by wrong food or too much food. They can also be induced by severe\nnervous and mental stress.\nThe walls of the stomach pour a powerful acid into the stomach (hydrochloric acid, or HCl). This\npowerful fluid is needed to digest protein. Although the walls of the stomach are protein, they are not\nnormally disturbed by the fluid. But when there are problems with people or with the food—then trouble\ncan begin.\nThe stomach acids begin digesting the walls of the stomach, because too much HCl is being produced;\nprotective mucous, in order to protect the walls, is not being produced; or both.\nThese ulcers can occur in the esophagus, but generally occur in the stomach or small intestine.\nGastric ulcers (peptic ulcers in the stomach) occur 2½ times more often in men than in women, most\nfrequently in the 40-55 age group.\nDuodenal ulcers (peptic ulcers in the small intestine) occur in the first 11 inches of the small intestine,\nand are caused by excess HCl from the stomach. These ulcers are found in men 4 times as often as in\nwomen, and most frequently between 25 and 40 years of age. Duodenal ulcers occur 10 times more\noften than gastric ulcers. As much as 15% of the U.S. population have ulcers, but only about half are\ndiagnosed. Some are not discovered until the person begins vomiting blood. Ulcers especially occur\nduring the spring and fall, and tend to run in families.\nMany factors affect stomach-acid secretion. Stress and anxiety increase it. Aspirin, steroids, anti-\ninflammatory drugs, and smoking—all increase HCl production.\nWhen you have stomach pain, drink some lemon juice. If the pain gets worse, you have too much acid in\nyour stomach.\nHypoglycemics tend to produce too much HCl and are in danger of eventually having a peptic ulcer.\nIf you vomit blood or have \"coffee-ground\" stools, then the ulcer is bleeding. You are in danger of\nbleeding to death—go to a hospital immediately.\n\nSymptoms\n\nChronic burning or gnawing stomach pain, which often begins 45-60 minutes after\nfinishing a meal or at night. Drinking a large glass of water or eating food relieves it. Vomiting or\nswallowing something quite alkaline also does. The pain sometimes awakens the person at 1 or 2 a.m.\nPain just beneath the breastbone is a frequent symptom of an ulcer. Sometimes it radiates to the back.\nThe pain is often considered to be heartburn or an empty stomach.\nOther symptoms may include headaches, a choking sensation, lower back pain, itching, and possible\nvomiting."},{"id":"disease-digestive-hepatitis","title":"Hepatitis","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Give the patient the type of care for any infectious disease, except that one should keep\nin mind that some of these hepatitis cases can be highly contagious.\n• Give hot fomentations over the liver area for 15 minutes, followed by a cold sponging,\nconcluded by a shower.

He should bathe frequently, and wash his\nhands with soap after every bowel movement. The toilet seat should also be washed after\neach usage.\n• He should not prepare food for others, and his own utensils should be sterilized after\neach of his meals.\n• His linen and clothes should be washed separately.\n• In China, 10% of the population have hepatitis at any one time.

As one might expect, the rate of liver cancer is quite high there.\n• A word to the wise: Gay men often take jobs working in restaurants; yet they have a high\nrate of hepatitis B and C infections, both of which do not reveal symptoms for weeks or\nmonths, during which they can, and do, transmit the infection to customers through food\nthey handle. Something to think about the next time you want to eat in a restaurant or café.\n\nCauses\n\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, and may be caused by a virus, bacterium, or toxic\nsubstance. But, in most instances, the cause is viral. There are actually several main types of hepatitis:\nHepatitis A (infectious hepatitis): Transmitted by contaminated water, milk, or food, it has an incubation\nperiod of 15-45 days. The contagion is highest just before illness begins, so food workers can transmit\nthe disease. Hepatitis A is contagious from 2 weeks to 1 week before the illness starts. It is easily spread\nby person-to-person contact and through contact with food, clothing, linens, etc. It can be transmitted\nfrom animals. Eating shellfish is a good way to get it, even if the waters they live in pass national\nstandards. Recovery generally occurs within 4 weeks. Chronic cases are less likely to occur.\nHepatitis B (serum hepatitis): Found throughout the world and spread as HIV is—through contact with\ninfected blood (contaminated needles, syringes, blood transfusions) and sexual contact. Six cases have\nbeen traced to contaminated acupuncture needles. About 5% of all Americans and 85% of gay men have\nit. Hepatitis B is very serious. It has an incubation period of 28-160 days (2-6 months), and recovery\nmay require 6 months. All during that time, it can be passed from one person to another. In increasing\nnumbers, cases are reverting to chronic active hepatitis, which can result in liver cirrhosis and death.\nHepatitis B is the ninth major killer in the United States.\nHepatitis C: Contracted in the same manner as HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C may take 6 months to\nproduce symptoms, yet all that time it can be spread from one person to another. Between 20-40% of all\nhepatitis cases are of this type. It accounts for 90-95% of all hepatitis transmitted by blood donations.\nHepatitis E, hepatitis non-A, and hepatitis non-B also exist, but are of lesser significance in North\nAmerica. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is in epidemic proportions in Africa and Asia, and is\nbecoming a serious problem in Mexico. It is generally contracted from drinking sewage-contaminated\nwater. Such water should be boiled before using.\nAll of the above are primarily viral forms of hepatitis. But there is also one which is caused by toxic\nchemicals. It is called toxic hepatitis. The amount to which the liver was exposed to the poisonous\nchemicals, fumes, drug, etc., determines the amount of damage to that organ.\nOverall, there are 40,000-70,000 reported, new cases of hepatitis each year in America. But the experts\nsuspect that there are probably ten times that many which go unreported. It most often occurs in young\nadults, and is highest in teenage girls.\nHepatitis A is decreasing, and hepatitis B is rapidly increasing. It is fourth among the 30 leading\ncommunicable diseases.\n\nSymptoms\n\nWeakness, nausea, headache, vomiting, fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite,\ndrowsiness, dark urine, joint stiffness and pains, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, light-\ncolored stools, and often jaundice (a yellowing of the skin, which will first be noticed in the eyes and\nmucous membranes). Skin rashes and itching may also occur; the latter is caused by excess bile salts\nunder the skin."},{"id":"disease-digestive-gallbladder-inflammation","title":"Gallbladder Inflammation","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• All eating must be stopped.

About one-fifth of Americans have the problem. Primarily occurring between the age\nof 20 and 50, women have it twice as often as men. It is said that three-fourths of the population\nexperience it at some time in their lives. Yet IBS is comparatively unknown in cultures where people eat\nsimply, and not too much of it.\nThe fundamental problem is that the muscles of the small and large intestines contract in spasms rather\nthan regularly. Something in the food bothers the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract,—probably the totality of\nthe strange things Westerners eat: processed, greasy, fried, sugared, chemicaled, synthetic, drugged, and\nalcoholed food; and eaten hurriedly, at irregular times.\nThese spasms cause the food to pass through the GI tract either too fast or too slow. When too slowly,\ntoo much water is absorbed, causing hard, dry stools; when too fast, too little water is absorbed and the\nstools are watery.\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a nuisance, but is not life-threatening. But be aware that symptoms of IBS\nmay indicate more serious problems, which sometimes are related by IBS: arthritis, diabetes mellitus,\ngallbladder disease, malabsorption disorders, candidiasis, pancreatic insufficiency, skin disorders, ulcers,\ncolon cancer, and parasitic infections, such as amoebiasis and giardiasis.\nThere are diseases which have similar symptoms, such as diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative\ncolitis, and lactose intolerance.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere are three basic patterns:\n(1) constipation and pain; (2) alternating constipation and diarrhea; (3) and painless diarrhea with\nmucous. Diarrhea frequently occurs upon arising, and again following breakfast. For the remainder of\nthe day, he may be constipated. Diarrhea at night is rare. Instead of diarrhea, stools sometimes are pasty\nand very narrow.\nAlso present may be gas, nausea, bad breath, heartburn, severe headaches, bloating, lack of appetite,\nweakness, faintness, backache, and heart palpitations.\nPain is often triggered by eating, and may be relieved by a bowel movement.\nA fifth of those with this problem also experience rectal bleeding."},{"id":"disease-digestive-diarrhea-in-infants","title":"Diarrhea In Infants","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Diarrhea in infants can be checked by the use of thin rice or barley water.

Also see \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"\n(Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)\n\nCauses\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome is caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). This condition has\nbecome widespread in America. the CDC in Atlanta estimates that tens of thousands of people are\ninfected with it. Yet they are unaware of it since symptoms are frequently not prominent.\nThis virus is also the cause of infectious mononucleosis. When mononucleosis occurs, the person\nbecomes very ill for two to four weeks, or longer if the diet is not corrected. (See \"Mononucleosis.\")\nEBV is a type of herpes virus, and is related to the viruses that cause genital herpes and shingles.\nKeep in mind that chronic fatigue syndrome can also be caused by certain other factors: candida albicans\n(yeast infection), anemia, chronic mercury poisoning from dental amalgam tooth fillings, hypoglycemia,\ninsomnia, and hypothyroidism. (All of the above problems are dealt with in articles in this book.)\nOnce EBV is contracted, it always remains in the body. Fortunately, most people develop antibodies to\nit. The problem occurs when they become run-down and overworked—and then the dormant EBV\nstrikes. It is more likely to reveal its presence when other diseases are also present, such as arthritis,\nlupus, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or AIDS.\nEBV causes the body to overreact, resulting in a burn-out of the immune system.\nEpstein Barr virus is very contagious, and can be transmitted by close contact, kissing, sharing food,\ncoughing, and through sex.\nBlood tests for antibodies against candida albicans, EBV, HBLV and CMV are available for specific\ndiagnosis. Yet the fact remains that EBV symptoms are similar to those for many infections, anemia,\nparasites, endocrine diseases, and AIDS.\n\nSymptoms\n\nRecurrent upper-respiratory tract infections, exhaustion, extreme fatigue, sore throat,\nswollen lymph nodes, achy joints and muscles, memory loss, low-grade fevers, headaches, poor\nconcentration, night sweats, irritability, and deep depression. Because the symptoms resemble flu and\nother viral symptoms, EBV is not always diagnosed correctly. In fact, it is frequently misdiagnosed as\nhypochondria, depression, or psychosomatic illness."},{"id":"disease-general-candidiasis","title":"Candidiasis","lang":"en","text":"Overview\n\n(Yeast Infection, Candida, Thrush, Chronic Fatigue\nSyndrome)\n\nTreatment\n\nTry to eliminate food allergies, hypoglycemia, any infections, and indigestion.\n• Replant Lactobacillus acidophilus. This is the friendly intestinal bacteria which the\n\"wonder drugs\" earlier killed off. Lactobacillus is a primary competitor of candida for\nfood in the intestine. Use a retention enema containing 4 oz. warm water and 10 billion\norganisms (empty twenty 500,000 organism capsules into the water). Use 3 times weekly,\n10 minutes each time.\n• Helpful herbs include burdock, echinacea, ginger, golden seal, bee pollen, kelp, lobelia,\npassion flower, pau d'arco, psyllium, slippery elm, ginkgo, and suma.\n• Useful nutrients include vitamin B complex with extra biotin: 100 mg 3 times a day. /\nB12 lozenges: place 2,000 mcg lozenge under tongue 3 times a day between meals. /\nEssential fatty acids: Wheat germ oil, primrose oil, etc. / Garlic capsules: 2 caps 3 times a\nday. / Multivitamin cap, 2-3 times a day. Take vitamin C up to bowel tolerance.\n• Also helpful: vitamin A: 25,000 IU one to two times a day; B6: 100-250 mg one to two\ntimes daily; vitamin E: 400-800 IU daily; biotin; aloe vera juice: 2 oz. four times per day.\n• Do not use oral contraceptives while you have candida. Do not use sugary foods. Do not\nuse cheese, alcohol, chocolate, fermented food, gluten grains (wheat, oats, rye, and\nbarley). Do not use meat, pickles, raw mushrooms, vinegar, or any yeast products.\n• Yeast thrives on sugars and carbohydrates. A vegetarian nondairy diet of protein,\nunrefined grains, and vegetables is best. Onions and garlic are very helpful. Fresh, raw\ngarlic is the best. Avoid meat-based proteins, since these are associated with abnormal\nbowel flora development. Avoid yeasted grain foods.\n• Avoid antibiotics and steroids, because they destroy the competing bacteria and allow\ncandida to overgrow.\n• Wear cotton underpants, rather than close-mesh synthetic or silk.\n• An alternative to douching is the sitz (sitting) bath. Fill a shallow tub to the hip with\nwarm water, then add salt (enough to make the water taste salty, about 1/2 cup) to match\nyour body's natural saline state. Add 1/2 cup vinegar to help rebalance the vaginal pH to\n4.5. Then sit in the water, knees apart, until it gets cool. The bath will do the cleansing.\nDouching can be done with a similar mixture (4 teaspoons vinegar to 1 pint of water).\nINFANT THRUSH—Four percent of infants have oral thrush. Keep rubber nipples clean, as well as all\nobjects going into baby's mouth. If bottle-feeding, boil nipples and bottles 20 minutes after thorough\nwashing (candida spores are heat resistant). Give plain water to cleanse the mouth after every feeding.\nInspect the mouth before each feeding, and begin treatment if thrush is seen. Swab infected areas with\nsaturated solution of baking soda 3-4 times a day. Garlic overpowers candida, so it may be swabbed on\nthe lesions several times a day.\n—Also see \"Vaginitis,\" \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"\n\nCauses\n\nThis is an infection caused by candida albicans, a normally harmless yeast (saprophyte)\nfound in your intestines. Some of it is also regularly found in your mouth, throat, and genital tract. But\nthis organism goes wild when its competitors, the normal bacteria of the intestines, are killed by long\nterm use of antibiotics. This enables the candida to greatly increase in number.\nStress causes a reduced production of stomach acid, which lets candida enter the stomach—a place\nwhere it normally is never found. As a result, less digested food enters the intestines, much to the liking\nof the candida which feeds upon it.\nThis yeast-like substance proliferates so massively that it enters the blood stream and is carried to many\nparts of the body, weakening the immune system and causing various problems.\nIn the oral cavity, candida is called thrush. White sores may develop on the tongue, gums, and inside the\ncheeks.\nIn the vagina, it results in vaginitis. Large amounts of a white, cheesy discharge and intense itching\noccur.\nOther effects are food allergies, athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch, and even diaper rash.\nCandida is not transmitted sexually, but mothers may pass thrush on to their newborn children. The\nbaby's tongue will appear red and be covered with white spots (generally appearing 8-9 days after\ndelivery) that will appear like milk spots. On the buttocks, thrush may resemble diaper rash.\nBecause their vaginal environment is more conducive to the growth of yeast, diabetic women can\ncontract candida easier than diabetic men.\nYou may wish to request a blood test for antibodies against C. albicans. A skin test, similar to a TB tine\ntest, is also available. A positive result is clear-cut. Unfortunately, a negative one provides less certainty\nthat one does not have it. Candida is difficult to diagnose, since a culture cannot be used. This is because\nthis yeast is a normal constituent of everyone's intestines.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms include bad breath, constipation, chronic infections, depression, fatigue,\nfood cravings, gas, headaches, adrenal and thyroid problems, hiatal hernia, indigestion, insomnia, mental\nconfusion, discomforting odors, panic attacks, and menstrual problems."},{"id":"disease-general-jet-lag","title":"Jet Lag","lang":"en","text":"Causes\n\nJetting across several time zones produces a sudden violation of your body's inner clocks.

This takes work.\nThe result is equally good, but no hearing loss results.\n• During the fever, give cold applications (cool wet sheet packs, sponge him off with cool\nwater, etc.). During the chills, give him hot applications (hot packs).\n• Give goldenseal tea.\n—See \"Fevers\" for additional suggestions.\n\nCauses\n\nThere are four types of parasites which are introduced into the bloodstream by the anopheles\nmosquito. If the disease becomes chronic (recurrent), it results in general debility, anemia, and an\nenlarged spleen.\nSevere cases can be very debilitating. An especially deadly form is called blackwater fever. The skin\ntakes on a yellow tint and the urine becomes progressively darker in color.

Unrelenting stress, chronic allergies, chronic infections can exhaust the immune system.\nMedicinal drugs, such as cortisone, prednisone and chemotherapy cause immune depression! Beware of\nthem! Other causes of a weakened immune system are vaccinations and immunizations against common\nchildhood and epidemic diseases. The thymus gland seems to be the most affected by this weakening.\nThe thymus gland is especially important due to its production of T-helper cells.\nProlonged stress, or toxic exposure to chemicals or radiation can weaken the immune system. Severe\ninfections can both result and cause it. An example of this would be allergies (resulting from immune\nmalfunction) which follow a severe case of rheumatic fever, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or other acute\nviral or bacterial disease. Lack of proper rest is yet another cause.\nYet another cause are nutritional deficiencies. Some natural healing specialists believe that any\ninfectious disease may be considered an immune deficiency problem.\nThe taking of aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, asthma, low birth weight and birth defects.\nMeat contains hormones, antibiotics, and bacteria which brings on disease. Alcohol, nicotine, and a high-\nsugar diet weaken the immune system. Air pollution is yet another problem (move out of the city!)\nHypothyroidism can also result in immune deficiency. Marijuana, cocaine, and the morphine family are\nother culprits. Mercury amalgam fillings are yet another incipient cause.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIt is the immune system which fights infections, and it does this by triggering defenses\nagainst invading bacteria. The antibodies and antitoxins of this system recognize these foreign bodies\nand send white blood cells to attack them. With his immune system weakened, a person is less able to\nwithstand Epstein Barr virus, candidiasis, food allergies, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, etc.\nInfections occur more easily.

All meat, gravy, fats, junk food, fried food, soft drinks, caffeine,\nalcohol, etc. had to be eliminated from the diet. The diet had to be low in fat and salt (thus helping the\nweakened kidneys).\n• It is best to eliminate all unsaturated fats. Fats quickly become rancid and, in that form,\nharm the connective tissue, and wear away the myelin sheath which covers the nerves.\n• Avoid eating alfalfa sprouts, for they contain canavain which, in your body, replaces its\narginine.\n• A vegetable juice fast would be very helpful.\n• Do not take birth control pills; they can intensify the lupus.\n• Up to 10% of the lupus cases originate by taking medicinal drugs (New England Journal\nof Medicine). Pollutants, additives, chemicals, and certain foods can also bring it on.\nWhen the cause is drugs, the kidneys or nervous system are generally not affected, the\nlupus is a milder case, and it tends to stop when the drug is no longer taken.\n• Parasites are associated with lupus. The parasites excrete droppings which interfere with\nbody functions. Until the blood stream is cleansed and the parasites removed, healing\ncannot commence.\n• Allergies can be another causative factor. Search them out and eliminate them. Here are\nseveral to consider: beef, cow's milk, wheat, corn, ammonia, hair spray, formaldehyde,\nperfume ethanol, pesticides.\n• Those with Raynoud's disease should live carefully, for they are also prone to\ncontracting lupus. Those with lupus are often misdiagnosed as having syphilis. Lupus is\nnot AIDS. HIV destroys the body's immune system, but lupus is one's immune system\ndestroying his body.\n• Obtain enough rest and exercise. Avoid all stress.\n• Echinacea, yucca, red clover, pau d'arco, and goldenseal are helpful herbs.\n\nCauses\n\nLupus is an inflammatory disease of the connective tissue. It has been classified as an\nautoimmune disease, since the body is attacking itself.\nUltraviolet rays in the sun can trigger the first attack. Stress, childbirth, fatigue, infection, chemicals, and\ncertain drugs can also bring it on.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIt usually begins suddenly with fever, fatigue, arthritis and/or joint pain. Those with it\nare frequently misdiagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis. Ninety percent of lupus occurs in women in\ntheir 30s. Other symptoms include a characteristic facial \"butterfly\" rash, severe hair loss, and papular\nskin lesions. This rash forms over the nose and cheeks in something of a butterfly shape (which tends to\nintensify because of sunlight).\nThe skin lesions are small, yellowish lumps. They leave scars when they disappear. (\"Lupus\" means\n\"wolf\" in Latin; indicating the rough-skinned appearance it gives to the skin.)\nAlso generally present are kidney disease (in 50% of those with lupus) and low white blood cell count.\nAll this, in turn, produces inflammation of the joints and/or blood vessels, affecting many parts of the\nbody.\nSometimes the first appearance of the problem is an arthritic-like condition, with swelling and pain in\nthe joints and fingers.

In the U.S., estimates run to 200,000 to 4 million;\nof which 90% are women.\nBecause each symptom affects different parts of the body, physicians and dentists often treat the\nsymptom which applies to their field as minor and of little consequence.\nTests are available to diagnose the disease. The cause is, so far, unknown. And, to date, there are no\nknown cures. The treatments, some of which are noted below, only help a person live with the condition,\nrather than solving it.

Causes can include heredity,\nor a debilitating disease. But there can be other reasons.\n• Exercise is important. Lack of it causes loss of bone and muscle mass, and inevitable\nphysical degeneration. Walk out of doors every day! Your life depends on it. Breathe\ndeeply. Be positive and cheerful as you walk. Hold your head up and enjoy it.\n• Hearing loss can accompany aging. Too much fat in the diet, and lack of vitamin A can\ncause hearing problems. Some physicians suggest that hearing loss is a sign of later heart\ndisease.\n• Processes of aging are accelerated by poor living, wrong eating and drinking habits, and\ndangerous activities. Some people make themselves prematurely old.\n• Older people do not absorb nutrients as well as younger people. This includes vitamins,\nminerals, and amino acids. Enzymes and co-enzymes are not produced as abundantly as\nthey formerly were. Food supplements are needed even more than in earlier years.\n• Eat good, nourishing food, but do not overeat. You are not working hard physically, as\nyou once did. Experimental rats were given much less in food calories, and lived 50%\nlonger.\n• Systematic undereating is one of the key secrets of longevity. Lose weight and keep\nslim. Extra weight rapidly ages you.\n• Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. A high fiber diet is important. If you are not\nhungry, then do not eat very much.\n• Brittleness and fragility of bones result as calcium is more poorly absorbed. Make sure\nyou are obtaining an adequate supply of calcium, vitamin D, and copper.\n• Drink freshly-made carrot juice every day.\n• If possible, drink only spring or steam-distilled water. Keep your body's water table\nhigh. It will go a long way toward protecting you against later heart and blood vessel\nproblems.\n• There is increased oxidation of cells with the advance of years. Take vitamin E to help\nsafeguard against this. Vitamins A and C are also antioxidants.\n• The B complex are needed for good brain function, proper digestion, sound nerves, and\nphysical stamina.\n• Vitamin C in your diet will lessen the likelihood of strokes and blood vessel ruptures. It\nstrengthens the body, and promotes healing of wounds. It fights infection.\n• Make sure you are obtaining enough minerals. Take a vitamin/mineral supplement so\nyou will get enough potassium, iron, selenium, zinc, and all the rest.\n• Eat a little Nova Scotia dulse or Norway kelp each day to get those needed trace\nminerals.\n• Stop smoking, drinking, and living in excess. Throw out the caffeine and processed\nfoods. Go to bed on time. If you cannot sleep in the middle of the night, pray and thank\nGod for your blessings. Go outside and breathe deeply of the good night air, then go back\nto bed and to sleep.\n• As much as you can, stay away from medicinal drugs, and you will be happier for it.\n• A person who is depressed or negative will age faster. Cheer up, go to God and surrender\nyour life to Him. Obey His Ten Commandment laws and trust your life to Him. Be\npeaceful in Christ. Find in Him your strength and hope.\n• It can be more difficult to deal with stress as you get older.

Elevated wheals result, along with\nswollen eyes. The subsequent scratching makes you appear swollen and scratchy. The intense itchy\nwheals which may result may disappear in minutes, hours, or several days.

It is known that poisonous substances in food, metals, drugs, and other toxic\nsubstances can do it. For example, risk of shingles increases with the use of anti-cancer drugs. Anything\nthat weakens the immune system can bring on an attack of shingles. Once it occurs, the pain can\ncontinue on for months or years. So it is better to prevent an attack.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSharp, burning pain along a nerve route somewhere in your body for 3-4 days. There\nare angry red blisters at that pain site several days later. These are very painful and itchy. Later the\nbumps blister, turn cloudy, and form scabs. It usually lasts 7-14 days from the time the blisters appear\nbefore the scabs drop off. This is no ordinary rash; it is shingles, which is a viral infection of a nerve. It\nmost often occurs on the skin of the abdomen, under the ribs and above the navel. But it can appear\nanywhere on the body. It most frequently occurs after the age of 50.\nIf shingles starts near an eye, beware! The cornea can become infected and blindness may result. You\nwould then do well to consult an eye specialist."},{"id":"disease-general-keratosis","title":"Keratosis","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Take vitamin A supplementation.

This is important. It might be well to select a warmer climate\nin which to live. Always wear gloves in cold weather (mittens will keep you even\nwarmer). Wear shoes; do not walk without them when it is cooler. Wear extra warm socks\nin the winter. Dress warmly at all times. Gloves, mittens, and shoes should be warm\nbefore putting them on, since it is difficult for one with this problem to warm them. Wear\nshoes which breathe, so you do not end up with damp, cold feet. Wear a warm hat in cold\nweather.\n• Avoid contact with cold objects, even for brief moments. While preparing meals, use\ntepid, not cold, water.\n• When an attack occurs, immerse the body part in warm (not hot) water, no warmer than\n90o F. Why not warmer water? During an attack, without realizing it, one's skin can more\neasily burn.\n• Massaging the hands and fingers every evening helps reduce the severity of the attacks,\nby stimulating blood circulation in that area.\n• Stressful situations produce a spasm of the blood vessels. As much as possible, avoid\nsuch situations. Keep calm, cheerful, and relaxed. Plan ahead and avoid scheduling\npressures. Trust in God and believe He will care for you. Vigorous outdoor exercise will\nstrengthen the entire body, and also relax it. Exercise tends to neutralize the attitude and\neffects of stress.\n• Avoid fatty and fried foods, all junk foods. At least 50% of your diet should be raw food.\nAvoid food items which tend to bother you (allergenic foods). Avoid caffeine (caffeine,\ntea, soft drinks, chocolate). Caffeine restricts blood flow. Use a fat-free, sugar-free diet.\nSugar increases blood viscosity as well as triglycerides. Avoid food seasonings.\n• Do not take any tobacco product or use alcohol. Nicotine causes constriction of the\nblood vessels and it produces plaque in them, both of which reduce blood flow. Do not be\neven in the same room where someone is smoking.\n• Medicinal drugs for Raynaud's do not seem to help. The side effects outweigh the\nbenefits (ergot, beta blocking drugs, cytotoxic agents, etc.). Do not take birth control pills.\n• Avoid machinery which vibrates the hands. In one study, 50% of pneumatic drill\nworkers had Raynaud's, compared with 5.6% for the average population. Such equipment\nincludes chain saws, metal grinders, stone cutters, lathes, and manual typewriters.\n• Drink enough water, but not soft drinks. Eat a high fiber diet which includes some\npsyllium seed, to help clean the colon. Eat slow-cooked grains and a low protein diet.\n• Take vitamin E (80-1,200 unites per day), unsaturated fatty acids alone (wheat germ oil,\netc.), tryptophan.\n• Take calcium (2,000 mg daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg daily). Get enough iron in\nyour diet. (webmaster's Note: It is reported that Zinc is also very helpful in this condition.\nsee http://coldcure.com/html/zinc-angina.pdf )\n• Sprinkle a small amount of cayenne on your food, to increase circulation. Other helpful\nherbs include garlic, ginkgo, biloba extract, and pau d'arco.\n• Sunbathing is also helpful, for it strengthens both the body and the blood.\n• One physician (Donald McIntyre) suggests occasionally swinging the arms in circles, 80\ntwirls per minute, to throw blood into the hands. He says to do it as a pitcher does it:\nswinging the arm up from the back and then hard downward in front. It has been found\nthat those with back problems can swing their arms entirely in front of the body with the\nsame beneficial effect on the hands (upward in the trunk and downward to the side).\n—Also see \"Buerger's Disease.\"\n\nCauses\n\nA cold attack is generally brought on by exposure to cold or emotional upset. The hands go\ninto the refrigerator for a moment, a difficult written exam must be taken, or a verbal conflict occurs.\nSpasms of small arteries result.\nThe underlying cause may be less easy to identify. It might be high blood pressure, drugs, connective\ntissue disease, inflammation of the arteries, or equipment vibrations which injure the blood vessels.\nSome individuals have lived in a cold, improperly heated environment for too many months or years,\nand the problem developed. Try to avoid resting or sleeping in ice cold places.\nFood allergies, junk food, or a poor diet which is high in starches and low in greens, vitamins, and\nminerals may cause it.\nApparently the cause is not a \"thoracic inlet syndrome\"; that is, squeezing of nerves or arteries issuing\nfrom the thorax by muscles or bones.\nInstead of Raynaud's, you might have Buerger's disease (a nerve disorder which gradually cuts off nerve\nsupply to the extremities). Buerger's disease is primarily caused by using tobacco products. (Buerger's is\na steady cutting off of nerve flow; whereas Raynaud's is an intermittent blood flow.)\nAntihypertensives, ergot drugs, channel blockers, or alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers can be the\ncause.\nThere are two forms of this condition:\n(1) Raynaud's phenomenon: This may be due to various bodily disorders. It occurs evenly\nin both men and women, and usually begins after the age of 30. Symptoms in the\nphenomenon may affect only one side of the body.\n(2) Raynaud's disease: This is primary disease, and occurs mainly in women. The disease\ngenerally begins in the teens or early twenties. But it can occur at any time in the life.\nAttacks normally affect both sides of the body equally.\nFrequency of the attacks are significant: They may be rare or occur as often as several times a day. Mild\noccurrences only last a few minutes; severe ones may continue for hours. Between attacks the hands will\nat first appear normal; later they may remain slightly bluish. Gradually the attacks will be more frequent\nand last longer.\nIn later years, the hands will be slightly bluish all the time. The fingers become swollen. The skin turns\npale, discolored, shiny, taut, and smooth. The nails become clubbed and deformed. In advanced stages,\npoor blood supply can weaken the fingers and damage the sense of touch. The sense of feel may\ndecrease and delicate movements become more difficult to perform. Infections and gangrene may occur\nmore frequently in the affected area.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe small arteries in the extremities constrict or tighten. The hands and feet are\nextremely sensitive to the cold, and suddenly contract. Lack of oxygenated blood causes the fingers or\ntoes to become whitish or bluish in hue. As a result, the affected area may temporarily shrink in size!\nUnless these attacks are reduced, ulcers may form, which further damage the tissue and produce chronic\ninfection under, and near, the fingernails and toenails.\nThe hands are the areas most often affected. But it can occur in the fingers and possibly toes, nose,\ntongue, cheeks, ears, or chin. The blood spasm may initially blanch the area. Tingling, and then\nswelling, may occur and become painful. The appearance may change to a bright red, as the blood\nvessels again distend and fresh blood is sent back into the area.\nThe attacks usually do not last long. But, in those instances in which they do, gangrene can develop."},{"id":"disease-general-buerger-s-disease","title":"Buerger'S Disease","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Stop using nicotine in every form; it is killing you in more ways than one.\n• Use the treatment outlined for Raynaud's disease.

As soon as a corn develops, apply oil to soften it.\n• Soak your feet in very diluted chamomile tea. It will both soothe and soften the hard\nskin. (The stain the tea makes on the feet will come off easily with soap and water.) Or\njust soak the feet in comfortably hot water for several minutes. Then apply a hand cream\nwhich contains 20% urea.

Use a pumice stone and emery board to trim down the corn or\ncallus.\n• Yet another formula is to crush 5-6 aspirin tablets and mix into a paste, by adding a half\nteaspoon each of water and lemon juice. Apply this to the hard-skin areas. Put the foot in a\nplastic bag, wrap a warm towel around it, and sit for 10 minutes. Then unwrap the foot\nand scrub the area with a pumice stone.

If diabetes is\ninvolved, add chromium supplementation. Avoid excess cholesterol, sorbitol (artificial\nsweetener), unsaturated fatty acids, and mercury tooth fillings (amalgam).\n• Higher blood sugar levels in diabetics and hypoglycemics causes the cells in the lense to\nabsorb large amounts of glucose.

Place a drop of honey in the corner of the eye at night.\nThis will help absorb the crystals.\n\nCauses\n\nThe most common cause is senility.\nCongenital cataracts occur if the mother had rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, or if the\ninfant has galactosemia (inherited inability to digest galactose [a type of milk sugar, resulting from\nlactose] properly). These cataracts generally do not get worse. Not using milk products at all can help\nprevent this in adults.\nTraumatic cataracts result from blows which rupture the anterior lens capsule, harmful chemicals,\nintense infrared radiation, or X rays. Radiation causes free radical damage in the eyes. This causes the\nlens to absorb aqueous humor. The lens becomes cloudy and must be removed, to restore eyesight.\nPeople living closer to the South Pole (which has part of its ozone layer stripped away) are more likely\nto develop cataracts.\nOther causes include hypoparathyroidism, Down's syndrome, and atopic dermatitis. The longer one has\ndiabetes, the greater the risk of cataracts.\nHair dye has been shown to cause cataracts. Only 23% of those not dying their hair get cataracts;\nwhereas 89% of those who dye their hair develop them.\nComplications of tumors, detached retina, iritis, glaucoma, and severe myopia can also bring it on.\nOther studies reveal that people with stress, allergies, or who eat seafood (thus ingesting methylmercury)\nare more likely to develop cataracts.\nIt is now known that a reduction in vitamin C or B in the diet can help produce cataracts. High blood\n2\nsugar levels and low calcium levels can also bring it on.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe lens of the eye becomes clouded, so that the eye is unable to properly focus on\nobjects.

Whatever the cause, stress sometimes adds to it.\nTinnitus is not a sign of a more serious problem or a precursor of any serious disease—unless it is\nassociated with Meniere's Disease (which see).\n\nSymptoms\n\nSounds in the ear: ringing; whistling; roaring; hissing; chirping; buzzing; and whining\ncricket sounds, when there is no outside physical source for these sounds. At first, they come and go; in\nadvanced stages, the sound is constant. No one else hears them.\nThere are reported instances in which others have heard the sounds from as much as 4 feet from the\nperson's ear. \"Tinnitus,\" in Latin, means \"to tinkle,\" or a \"bell-like ring.\"\nThe frequency of tinnitus increases with age.

It is also called pyorrhea, or gum disease. Gingivitis (which see) is\ninflammation of the gums, an early stage of periodontal disease.\nThe explanation given by many medical-dental professionals for periodontal disease is that plaque\n(sticky deposits of mucous, food particles, and bacteria) adheres to the teeth and gradually accumulates.\nThis plaque causes the gums to become infected and swollen. That infection (called gingivitis), leads to\npyorrhea (also called periodontitis) in which the bone underlying the teeth is eroded away by the\ninfection.\nThe other explanation is that much of what is known as pyorrhea is primarily caused by an inadequate\nintake of calcium, copper, vitamins D and C; by the eating of processed, and junk, food; and by erosion\nof acids, placed in the mouth.

The professional explanation for the problem is that the wearers do\nnot take proper care of them, and that the gums periodically change shape, etc.\nThere is another, less-known, reason: When the decision is made to extract teeth and fit an individual for\ndentures, the teeth are pulled out and the molds prepared for the false teeth. The entire process is done as\nquickly as possible, so teeth will appear to be in the mouth again as soon as possible. In addition, it is a\nconvenience to the dentist to take the molds the same day that the extractions were done.\nBut when the extractions are made, the gums understandably swell! A number of sizeable wounds have\nbeen made in the mouth, and the gums are swollen and inflamed. That is not the time to take the molds.\nInstead, the person should wait at least one week for the gums to heal and readjust into their normal post-\ndental sizes and shapes. Then those molds should be made.\nIf your dentist tells you that you need all your teeth pulled out, discuss the matter with him and perhaps\ncheck with another dentist or two. Very often only certain teeth need be removed and a bridge can be\ninstalled, which locks onto the teeth which remain. This is far better than wearing dentures. Do all you\ncan to keep your teeth.\nLIVING WITH DENTURES—\n• Practice speaking. By yourself, read aloud from books and learn how to articulate\nvowels, consonants, and various combinations.\n• Temporary denture adhesives may be necessary when you are first getting used to your\nnew dentures. But you should not need to rely on adhesives all the time. The dentures\nshould fit properly. Do not let the dentist take molds too soon.\n• When you can, take out the dentures so the gums can rest.\n• Begin by eating soft foods, and gradually get used to chewing with dentures.\n• After each meal, scrub the dentures with soap and lukewarm water. Wash your gums\ngently with a soft toothbrush, to remove the plaque.\n• Massage your gums every day. Place your index finger over the outside of the gums,\nanother finger over the inside portion, and rub back and forth.\n• Rinse your mouth each day with warm water mixed with a tsp. of salt.\n\nSymptoms\n\nLoose-fitting dentures; dentures which may hurt the gums when chewing; dentures\nwhich cause difficulty in speaking properly."},{"id":"disease-general-saliva-problems","title":"Saliva Problems","lang":"en","text":"Symptoms\n\nNot enough saliva, causing a dry-mouth condition.

It often stops the hiccups in minutes. The sugar in\nthe mouth probably sends different signals along the nerve routes, interfering with the\nhiccups.\n• Close your mouth, hold your nose and ears closed with your fingers and thumbs, and\nswallow 3 times before you let go. This creates a slight vacuum and changes the rhythm of\nthe diaphragm enough to bring relief.\n• Chew and swallow ice for 10-15 minutes.\n• Stand behind the person as he sits on a chair.

After 430 million hiccups, he passed away.\nAlmost all hiccups are one-sided; that is, only one side of the diaphragm contracts. Overeating or\nexcessive drinking is the most common cause. It causes the stomach to extend downward and press\nagainst the diaphragm—which then starts its hiccuppy motions.\nA hiccup is a repeated involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, immediately followed by a\nsudden closure of the glottis.\nBut that information does not help solve the problem. Here is advice that may. All of these methods\nreally work for some people. See what is best for you.

This enables the stomach to slide up\nsomewhat.\nThe weakness is often caused by increased pressure upward, from what is in or near the abdominal\ncavity: obesity, pregnancy, tumors, heavy lifting, overeating, straining at the stool, or tight clothing.\nIt is said that nearly half the people over 40, in the U.S., have hiatal hernias. But most are unaware of it,\nsince these hernias are often quite small and are hardly noticed. They occur in women four times as\noften as in men, perhaps due to tight clothing. They generally first occur after the age of 40.\nThe acid material that comes up into the windpipe, from the larger hernias, frequently causes ulceration\nin the esophageal wall.\nBut ulcers can also occur in the duodenum, which is the top part of the small intestine, just below the\nstomach.\nPeople with this condition have a tendency to have overacid stomachs.\nBetween the esophagus and stomach is the esophageal sphincter. This is a circular valve which can open\nand close. But its strength is damaged by drugs, tobacco (smoked or chewed), or certain foods. This\nweakening allows food and acid to go back up into the windpipe.\nThose certain foods include coffee and chocolate (because of the methylxanthines in them), spicy foods,\ntomato, alcohol, peppermint, spearmint, and citrus juices. Tobacco and coffee are especially bad. Whole\nmilk can also be a problem. Weakening of the sphincter occurs within 30 minutes after drinking coffee.\nOne puff of a cigarette can lower sphincter pressure to zero; the result is called \"smoker's heartburn.\"\n\nSymptoms\n\nHeartburn and belching. There may be difficulty in swallowing. Material from the\nstomach may suddenly return into the throat or mouth, causing a burning sensation. It may feel as if\nthere is a lump in the throat, or that food is sticking at a point in the throat. Sometimes bloody mucous is\ncoughed up."},{"id":"disease-general-vomiting","title":"Vomiting","lang":"en","text":"Overview\n\n(Emesis)\n\nCauses\n\nThe cause is often overeating, eating the wrong food, poor combinations, or excessive\nalcohol consumption. But it can also be caused by food allergies, poisoning, food poisoning, or infection\n(flu, Epstein-Barr syndrome, candida, etc.) If the vomitus (that which comes up) looks like \"coffee\ngrounds,\" it includes large amounts of blood from a bleeding ulcer or stomach cancer. This is an\nemergency, for extensive internal bleeding can result in death. Take him to the emergency room.\nIf it occurs in infants, accompanied by fever and the child is unresponsive, it could indicate meningitis.\nCall a physician immediately. (See meningitis.)\nBut it might be that you need to induce vomiting, after someone eats a poisonous plant, rat poison, etc.\nTO ASSIST VOMITING TO OCCUR—If you have eaten something poisonous or are having a\ngallbladder attack, an emetic will help. Drink an emetic herb tea. Lobelia is probably the best. Make an\nherb tea of lobelia or peach leaves, and take a teaspoonful every 15 minutes for 3-4 hours.\nEMETIC HERBS—When giving lobelia tea, give the full dose all at once or you will not induce\nvomiting. Add 1 oz lobelia to a quart of boiling water; let it steep for 5-10 minutes if you are in a hurry\n(15-20 minutes is better). Then give a cup or two of the liquid (not hot), and let him vomit.\nOther emetic herbs include bayberry bark, myrica, white willow, and ragwort.\nIn his book, Back to Eden (see order sheet), p. 260, Kloss gives a complicated formula for giving herbs\nto help a person vomit. You might wish to refer to it.\nTO STOP VOMITING—Give very small doses of lobelia; it will relax the person and the vomiting\nwill cease. Use a teaspoon of boiling water, steep, take a teaspoonful of this every 15 minutes, until\nrelief is obtained. A cup of hot peppermint or spearmint tea, taken after the stomach has been cleaned\nout, will also help settle it. Catnip or sweet balm are also useful. A hot fomentation over the stomach, or\na hot water bottle with a moist towel under it, will help settle the stomach.\nAFTER VOMITING—Do not eat for several hours, but carefully take fluids, as you are able.\nYou lose a lot of fluid when you vomit. Be sure and replace it. Drink water, do not become dehydrated.\nThose fluids should be clear: water, weak tea, or fruit juices. Milk and heavy soups may be too much for\nthe stomach just then.\nDrink small amounts of peppermint tea.\nVomiting also flushes out minerals. These need to be replaced with electrolyte drinks, clear soups, or\napple or cranberry juice. If only water, add a couple pinches of sugar and salt to it. After vomiting, it is\nbest to sip the fluids, then pause, then sip a little more; do not gulp them down. Do not drink cold fluids;\nit is a shock to the weakened stomach. Do not drink carbonated products at this time.\nWhen you are ready to eat, start back with a small carbohydrate meal, such as rice soup. Avoid fatty\nsubstances, for they would remain in the tired stomach too long.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe person vomits."},{"id":"disease-general-dyspepsia","title":"Dyspepsia","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Do not eat when you are in a hurry or under stress. You should be able to relax when you\neat. Do not eat when you are upset or excessively tired. Do not drink liquids with your\nmeal, for this dilutes your stomach juices. Take time to chew your food thoroughly.\n• Eat more live (raw) foods rather than primarily heavily cooked items. Fresh, raw foods\nare rich in enzymes that help digest and assimilate the nutrients. But those enzymes are\ndestroyed when heated to more than 120o F. All processed foods have been heated above\n120o F.\n• Cut down on the meat or eliminate it entirely. It is very hard to digest, and frequently\ncarries bacteria and parasites.\n• Be sure and include enough fiber in your meal. Otherwise you are more likely to have\nconstipation, with consequent absorption of toxins back into the system.\n• Include trace minerals in the diet (in Norway kelp and Nova Scotia dulse), and obtain\nadequate vitamin and mineral supplementation. If you are having a difficult time\nabsorbing your food, you need to maintain good supplementation all the more.\nSwallowing air (by chewing with the mouth open or talking while chewing) can cause\nindigestion.\n• First thing in the morning, juice a lemon and and drink it in a cup of water. This will\nhelp prepare your stomach for its daily duties.\n• Ginger is good, to lessen digestive nausea.\n• Catnip, chamomile, fennel, and peppermint are all helpful in reducing indigestion. Mint\ntea calms the stomach.\n• Papain, papaya (containing the digestive enzyme papain), and fresh pineapple\n(containing another digestive enzyme, bromelin) are also very helpful.\n• Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D are needed.\n• English bitters are very helpful. Take them before each meal.\n• Helpful herbs include balm, bitter orange, celandine, hops, fennel, and yarrow.\n• Alcohol; vinegar; caffeine; and spicy, refined, or greasy foods promotes indigestion.\n• Food allergies, such as lactose intolerance, can cause it also, so locate them. (See\nAllergies.) Avoid foods which tend to bother you. Take the pulse test in order to determine\nyours. (See Pulse Test.)\n• Do not eat too heavily of legumes, especially lentils, peanuts, and soybeans. They\ncontain a substance which slows down certain digestive enzymes.\n• Avoid these food combinations: milk and sugar, fruits and vegetables, sugar and protein.\n• Take an out-of-door walk after breakfast. If you can, do it where the air is fresh, not by a\nhighway.\n• Keep in mind Kouchadoff's discovery. This Russian scientist experimented with cooked\nfood and found that, when it was eaten, the white blood cells increased rapidly in the\nsmall intestine. As part of our immune system, they increase to fight hostile invaders. In\nother words, when your white blood cell count goes up, a threatened infection or disease is\nbeing prepared for.\n• Eating raw foods protects the immune system, and does not cause an increase in white\nblood cell count.\n• Dr. Bircher-Benner, of Switzerland, discovered that eating raw food at a meal before\ncooked food prevented the formation of white cells in the intestines. Therefore, he always\nserved raw salads before cooked foods.\n—Now, for the other side of the coin:\n• There is a theory which some accept and others reject. Consider this:\n• A major cause of indigestion is eating salads and other light food at the beginning of the\nmeal, and waiting till partway through the meal to eat the protein foods. But protein foods\nneed lots of HCl for proper digestion; the other foods do not. So begin your meal with\nyour protein foods. You can eat salads with your protein food, but not before it.\n• Which theory is correct? The truth may be in the middle: Those who have an abundance\nof HCl tend to do better eating some protein at the beginning of the meal, and those who\ndo not have as much do better eating the raw foods, to begin with.\n—Also see \"Nervous Dyspepsia,\" \"Bloating,\" \"Achlorhydria,\" \"Allergies,\" and \"Pulse Test.\"\n(Poor Digestion; Indigestion)\n\nCauses\n\nThe main causes are dietary habits and stress. Lack of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and enzymes\nare other major causes. Lack of enzymes keep vitamins and minerals from being used properly.\nInadequate HCl means the protein food will not be digested correctly.\nOther contributing factors include peptic ulcers. Intestinal obstruction can also lead to indigestion. If the\nliver, pancreas, or gallbladder are not function properly, it is more difficult for the body to digest food.\nA key factor can be hydrochloric acid production (see Achlorhydria).\nIf food does not digest properly, it tends to ferment in the intestines. This produces hydrogen and carbon-\ndioxide gas, which causes bloating and pain. (See Bloating.)\n\nSymptoms\n\nGas, a bloated feeling, rumbling noises, belching, possibly a burning feeling, and\nvomiting."},{"id":"disease-general-nervous-dyspepsia","title":"Nervous Dyspepsia","lang":"en","text":"(J.H.

But some will continue to have\nchronic symptoms arising so often, for months or years. This is called chronic relapsing\npancreatitis.\n• It is wise to do everything possible to avoid the chronic condition or, if it is has begun,\ntry to clear it up as much as possible.\n• Fast and take only water until the acute symptoms subside. Food in the stomach triggers\nthe pancreas to start working, and this you do not want just now.\n• Give slippery elm enemas. Cut the slippery elm bark into very small pieces, and put a\nlarge handful in 4 quarts of water. Simmer for 1-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Then let it\nset, covered for 30 minutes. Strain and use it warm. Drink it and use in enemas.\n• Place a heaping teaspoonful of lobelia in a cup of boiling water and let it steep for a half\nhour; then add a tablespoon of this lobelia tea to each cup of slippery elm tea, and drink.\nAlso drink a cup a hour before each meal and before retiring.

Without it,\nfats cannot be properly handled by the body. So eat a low fat diet for the rest of your life.\n• Go on a low sugar diet. A heavy diet of refined carbohydrates can cause pancreatitis.\n• Say good-bye to all alcoholic beverages, and also to caffeine.\n• Avoid overeating. This also overworks the pancreas.\n• There are no medications which can solve this problem. Indeed, it was medications\nwhich may have led to it; continuing to take them may only intensify the disease.\n• Even though total pancreatactomy may be recommended, avoid surgery. It will probably\nonly worsen the condition.\n• In case of a very serious acute crisis, give frequent hot steam pack fomentations to the\nabdomen. Give charcoal internally, and apply it as a poultice over the affected area. Place\nthe person on a strict program of what he eats and drinks.\n\nCauses\n\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Normal cells are replaced with scar tissue and\ncalcium deposits. It frequently produces mild diabetes.\nThe most frequent causes of pancreatitis are drinking alcohol, viral infection, and diseases of the bile\nducts or gallbladder. A diet rich in fats and meat lays a solid foundation for pancreatitis to occur. Other\ncauses include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, and a considerable variety of prescribed\nmedications. Oral contraceptives, steroids, estrogen, and ACTH can also do it.\nTo this list should be added abdominal injury, obesity, poor nutrition, and electric shock.\nCertain diseases can also induce it: hepatitis, mumps, and possibly anorexia nervosa.\nThe pancreas produces two important hormones: insulin and glucagon; both of which regulate blood\nsugar levels and aid digestion. As a result, pancreatitis can produce glucose intolerance and diabetes.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAcute cases: A sudden attack of severe burning or stabbing pain in the upper abdomen,\npossibly accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain may spread to the back and is made worse by\nmoving. Food, alcohol, and vomiting may worsen the pain.\nChronic cases: The pain is milder and pain attacks do not come on suddenly. There is excessive gas,\nmuscle aches, and fever. Permanent damage to the pancreas can occur, because the constant\ninflammation can produce fibrosis in that organ. The chronic state results in irreversible changes in the\ngallbladder.\nOther symptoms of pancreatitis include abdominal swelling and distension, hypertension, sweating, and\nabnormal fatty stools.\nDiabetes, digestive problems, and cancer can also result, as well as hearing, respiratory, and kidney\nfailure."},{"id":"disease-general-infectious-jaundice","title":"Infectious Jaundice","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Give him bed rest, keep his bowels open, using daily enemas if necessary.\n• If he can take food, give him a liquid diet.

They worsen the\ncondition rather than improving it. A full 50% of those who undergo surgery report a\nrapid increase in symptoms afterward.\n• Helpful herbs are black walnut, burdock, goldenseal, pau d'arco, psyllium, saffron, aloe\nvera, fenugreek, slippery elm, and white oak bark.\n—Also see \"Ulcerative Colitis.\"\n(Regional Enteritis; Ulcerative Colitis)\n\nCauses\n\nCrohn's disease is also known as regional enteritis. Ulcerative colitis is a different disorder,\nbut similar enough in symptoms and treatment that we will list them together.\nThe difference is that ulcerative colitis only involves the first two layers of the intestinal wall (the\nmucosa and submucosa); whereas Crohn's disease also affects the next two layers (the connective tissue\nand the wall muscles).\nCrohn's disease is a chronic ulceration of one or more sections of the digestive tract. Three special facts\nare (1) the ulceration reaches into all layers of the gastro-intestinal (GI) wall, (2) the entire GI tract can\nbe involved, from mouth to the anus, and (3) this is usually a long-lasting condition.\nAs the inflamed portions heal, scar tissue remains, which keeps narrowing the channel.\nMany puzzles still surround this condition. The origin is not clearly understood, and certain racial groups\ncontract it more than others (Jews have it more than anyone else).\nBut certain facts stand out:\nFood food allergies may help it start, and identifying and avoiding them helps reduce it.\nA lack of vitamins C and E in the diet aggravates the problem.\nPeople in Europe and North America have it far more than those living elsewhere in the world.\nJews in America have it much more than Jews in Israel. Caucasians have it less often than Jews, but\nmore often than other races.\nTherefore it is likely that the modern, Western, diet is a significant factor. Eating simple, nourishing\nfood is an important aspect of dealing with this problem.\nRarely does the disease strike once and go away. Most of the time it recurs for years. When this\nhappens, the ongoing scarring keeps reducing bowel functions.\nIf ignored, eventually Crohn's disease can lead to cancer.\nNo definite cure is known, but certain things tend to alleviate the problem.\nIt is believed that Crohn's disease is an autoimmune problem; that is, the GI tract has become so toxic\nfrom years of mistreatment, that the immune system becomes confused and begins attacking the part of\nthe body housing the toxic food.\n\nSymptoms\n\nLoss of energy, appetite, and weight. Chronic diarrhea, fever, chronic rectal bleeding,\nmalabsorption, pain in the entire abdomen, excess fat in the stool (resulting in pale, bulky stools that\nfloat). Malnutrition results."},{"id":"disease-general-diverticulitis","title":"Diverticulitis","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• In order to avoid the formation of those little pouches, always avoid constipation.\nThis is done by including enough roughage in your diet (fresh fruit and vegetables, bran,\nand other sources of fiber), and by drinking enough water, etc. (See \"Constipation\" for\nmore information.) Psyllium seed and flaxseed also help soften the stools.\n• Have a bowel movement when you sense you ought to. Do not wait.\n• Obtain adequate exercise, especially out-of-doors.\n• Prunes, pureed fruit juices, and herb teas are very helpful.\n• Carrot, beet, celery, and green juices are excellent. Of the fruit juices, papaya, apple,\npineapple, and lemon are outstanding for your purposes.\n• Chew nuts, seeds, and popcorn well, so they will be less likely to enter the diverticula.\n• Eat smaller meals.\n• Rats placed on high-fat diets, for 90 weeks, all developed colon diverticula.\n• Avoid caffeine products. They all tend to irritate the colon.\n• Do not eat a lot of sugar.\n• Smoking and stress make the symptoms worse.\n• Girdles, belts, and tight bands around the waist tend to increase abdominal pressure on\nthe colon.\n• Helpful herbs include slippery elm, peppermint, chamomile, and aloe vera.\nDURING AN ATTACK—As soon as an attack begins, give yourself a cleansing enema (2 quarts of\nwater and the juice of a fresh lemon). Take 4 charcoal tablets with a large glass of water.\nIn case of pain or spasm in the colon, apply a heating pad over the abdomen.\nDuring the acute phase of an attack, it may be best to eat a low-fiber diet for a short time. Then return to\nthe high-fiber regime.\nIf the attack is severe, temporarily blend your food. Drink carrot, cabbage, and green juices.\nTo relieve pain, massage the abdomen on the left side. Stand up and stretch.\nTry to have bowel movements on schedule. Take fiber first thing in the morning, and down a quart of\nwater before breakfast.\nCheck your stools daily. If they are black, this means blood is present; take a sample to a physician.\n\nCauses\n\nDiverticula are small pouch-like sacs on the inside of the large bowel, generally in the\ndescending colon. When a person is constipated, he tends to push too hard. The air pressure exerted by\nthis muscular squeeze on the bowel muscles can force small pockets to form in the walls of the lower\ncolon.\nOnce they form, diverticula never go away. Of themselves, they provide no symptoms. The problem is\nthat fecal matter can collect in them and eventually attract bacteria. This results in infection or\ninflammation, which produces the fever, chills, and pain.\nDiverticulosis is when you have diverticula. It is basically symptomless. Diverticulitis is when they are\ninflamed or infected; then the unfortunate symptoms reveal themselves.\nThis is another disease caused by \"civilized\" refined and junk foods. It is practically unknown in Third\nWorld nations, and was almost totally unknown before our century.\nMore than half of those over 60 in America have this problem.\n\nSymptoms\n\nNo symptoms until they become infected or inflamed, resulting in chills, fever, and\npain. The pain may be localized in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and may be constant.\nSometimes there is a brief period of diarrhea."},{"id":"disease-general-rectal-fissures","title":"Rectal Fissures","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Avoid constipation.

This can be caused by stress, malnutrition, shock, or injury. But, today, the\nterm is generally applied only to those who have anorexia nervosa. This article only applies to this latter\ndefinition.\nSome consider anorexia nervosa to be a psychiatric illness. Others believe that reaction to a strong,\nunderlying collection of allergenic foods is the problem. The often repeated phrase, \"I always feel better\nwhen I don't eat, and feel bad when I do,\" can apply to both viewpoints.\nAbout a third of those with this problem prematurely die from starvation, infections, heart disorders, or\nsuicide.\nThe underlying cause must be dealt with. Love and understanding is needed. Help from someone outside\nthe family may be needed.

Also see \"Crohn's\nDisease.\"\n(Celiac Sprue, Gluten Intolerance)\n\nCauses\n\nCeliac disease affects the small intestine. There are abnormalities in the intestinal lining, due\nto a permanent intolerance to gluten. Gluten is in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. (Corn, rice, millet,\nsoybeans, quinoa, and amaranth do not contain gluten. There seems to be a little uncertainty about\nbuckwheat.) The protein, gliaden, is thought to be the toxic part of the gluten. It interacts with the lining\nof the intestines, causing the tiny absorptive fingers which jut from it (the villi) to flatten and atrophy.\nAs a result, nutrients are not absorbed (including vitamins A, D, and K) and the disease symptoms\nappear.\nUnfortunately, many physicians and the food industries recommend that grains be introduced into the\ndiet of the infant when they are less than a year old. This can prompt celiac disease to first appear then\nor even decades later.\nThis is important! Tell every expectant mother not to feed her child grains until it is at least a year old.\nRemoving gluten from the diet of a celiac produces a marked change; whether an infant, child, or adult,\nthe person starts feeling better again. But he must not return to gluten foods.\nSome infants do not tolerate cow's milk protein, and react to it with celiac symptoms, even before gluten\nis given to them. So remove that also from them.\nCeliac disease is often misdiagnosed as spastic colon, irritable bowel syndrome, or something else which\naffects the intestines.\nYet, if left untreated, celiac disease can be quite serious. It can lead to pancreatic disease, infertility,\nmiscarriages, internal hemorrhaging, bone disease, gynecological disorders, nervous system damage,\nintestinal lymphoma, and many more. For example, anemia is common, due to poor absorption of folic\nacid, iron, and vitamins B and K.\n12\nScarring of the intestinal lining can progress so far that, by the age of 45 to 50, 90% of the intestine can\nbe damaged, resulting in a significant reduction (as much as 70%) of the absorptive surfaces.\nBut there is evidence that partial repair to those walls can be made within several months, if you\npermanently part company with the offending foods.\n\nSymptoms\n\nDiarrhea, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies such as anemia. Other symptoms\ninclude frequently pale and/or light-yellow, foul-smelling stools that float; fatigue; depression;\nabdominal swelling; muscle cramps; wasting; and bone and/or joint pain. Diarrhea is the most\ncommonly observed symptom.\nInfants and children may show vomiting; stunted growth; intense burning sensation of the skin; and a\nred, itchy skin rash.

But for many\nwho are habitually underweight, the solution is to continue eating moderate-sized meals,\nbut eating only nourishing food (no junk or processed food). Adequate and complete\nproteins are essential.\n• Be sure and correct vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n• You may need to take digestive enzymes and/or supplemental hydrochloric acid (betaine\nHCl).\n• Obtain moderate out-of-door exercise each day. This will help your system digest the\nfood.\n• Obtain adequate rest at night, and try to lie down and rest 15, 30, or 60 minutes before\neach meal. This is important, and will strengthen your body for the challenge of coping\nsuccessfully with another meal.\n• Avoid stress of various kinds.\n• Eat in relaxed surroundings. Do not eat when you are nervous or upset.\n• Try to maintain regularity in all your habits and activities.\n• For infants, mashed bananas are more easily digested than some other foods.\n• There may be a food allergy, such as wheat, cow's milk, etc. (see Pulse Test).\n• It is vital that you not consume fried food, junk food, drink, and processed food. Avoid\ncaffeine, tobacco, and alcohol.

Some of them wish they could be thinner.\n(Thinness)\n\nCauses\n\nUnderweight is a problem for some, but not for others. Actually, as one ages, underweight\ncan be an advantage in a number of ways. If you are in good health, although underweight, there may be\nno need for concern to gain weight. Underweight people live longer and are in less danger from heart\ndisease.\nBut underweight may be associated with health problems; it should especially be a cause for concern if\nunintended, sudden weight loss has occurred.\nTry, if possible, to ascertain the cause of the weight loss or inability to gain weight. Here is a list of\nseveral possible causes:\nUnplanned-for weight loss can be caused by an inability by the gastro-intestinal tract to digest and\nabsorb food properly, resulting from ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, etc.\nIt can be caused by intestinal parasites or liver and pancreas problems.\nIt can be caused by digestive enzyme deficiency, allergy, or food sensitivity.\nIt can be caused by endocrine imbalances, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or (sometimes)\nhypothyroidism. If you are both underweight and feel cold all the time, you may be hypothyroid (which\nsee). Problems in the thyroid, pancreas, or adrenal glands can make weight gain impossible.\nHypoglycemics and diabetics have an especially hard time maintaining proper weight.\nIt can be caused by a chronic illness, surgery, stress, or emotional trauma (such as the death of a loved\none).\nIt can be caused by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, medicinal or street drugs, or AIDS.\nIn addition, there may be an eating disorder: The person eats too little (anorexia) or, in some cases, eats\ntoo much.\nZinc deficiency can reduce appetite, and so can some wasting diseases, such as cancer.\nThe consistency of the bowel movement and a check for undigested foods can be a valuable diagnostic\naid.\nThe experts tell us that, for adults, weight should not be gained at the rate of more than a pound a week.\nIn infants and children, the cause may be not enough food; in old people, it may result from disinterest in\neating or poverty.\nYou should especially be concerned about an infant or small child who suddenly seems to stop gaining\nweight normally. This may be caused by celiac disease (which see) or something else.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe person weighs 10% less than an average person of his height and weight.\nSymptoms, when underweight, is a problem to be addressed.

Tobacco smoke should be banished from the\nhome, car, and place of work. Also avoid hair spray and other sprays.\n• Avoid allergens that you know of.\n• Maintain a program of regular exercise. Walking out-of-doors is always the best. Try\nusing 1- or 2-pound hand weights and work the muscles in the neck, upper shoulders, and\nchest. Those with chronic emphysema need strong muscles there more than others do.\n• Eat less and a little more often. Prolonged digestion requires more oxygen and blood to\nthe stomach, and away from other parts of the body which also need them.\n• Avoid gas-forming foods, such as legumes and cabbage. These cause abdominal\ndistention which can interfere with breathing.\n• Sip warm, clear liquids in the morning (such as herb teas), to help clear mucous from the\nairways.\n• Excessively hot or cold foods may induce coughing.\n• Avoid hard-to-chew foods and maintain a low- salt diet.\n• Do not eat when emotionally upset or angry.\n• Drink enough water. The fluid intake is needed to keep the mucous, in the lungs, thin.\n• Maintain your ideal body weight. Some of those with this problem tend to put on weight\nand retain fluid. The closer you are to your ideal weight, the better for your lungs. Stay on\na low-calorie diet. The thinner you are, the less flesh your lungs have to supply oxygen to.\n• Obesity and constipation decrease the patient's resistance to respiratory infection.\n• Keep your clothing loose; this helps you breathe better.\n• Learn to breathe correctly. The tendency is to breathe short and fast. But make yourself\nbreathe steadily, from the diaphragm. Strengthen your respiration muscles by blowing out\nslowly through pursed lips for 30 minutes a day. Try to exhale twice as long as it took you\nto breathe in.\n• Learn to cough properly. Inhale slowly and deeply, exhale through pursed lips, and\ncough in short huffing bursts rather than vigorously.\n• Pace yourself in your work. Work steadily; it is not necessary to work fast.\n• When working, lift while you exhale through pursed lips; inhale while you rest. When\nclimbing steps, climb while exhaling; inhale when you stop to rest.\n• Go through the day relaxed, not with a sense of alarm over your air problems.\n• Avoid contact with anyone with a respiratory infection.\n• Avoid drugs which suppress coughs. They dry up secretions, which you do not want.\n• Use only essential and unscented soaps. Avoid perfumes, gas stoves, carpeting, curtains\nand draperies which cannot easily be cleaned. Avoid hot, humid climates. Avoid furry,\nfeathered animals in your home.\n• Get plenty of fresh air. Use a warm scarf or mask over the mouth and nose when\noutdoors in cold weather. Keep the body warm at all times.\n• Place 3, 4, or 5-inch blocks under the foot of the bed. This will help prevent mucous\nfrom accumulating in the lower part of the lungs during the night. (But not too steep, for\nthat would be hard on the heart.)\n\nSOLVING THE PROBLEM—\nThe suggestions above are typical of what you will find in most books. It is difficult to find remedial\nsolutions, but here is one:\nSeveral years ago, a Christian mother visited her neighbors, and met a woman with emphysema. It was a\nsmall, stuffy house and the lady smoked. So the mother went back home and eventually found a\ntreatment; it was a wet heating pack from Kneipp's book, written nearly two centuries ago. She gave the\ntreatment to the woman, who got well within several weeks. This was the treatment:\n• Place a plastic sheet on the bed, both above the bottom sheet and beneath the top sheet\nand covers. Dip another sheet in very cold water, and wring it out somewhat—quickly, to\nkeep in the cold.\n• Work quickly: Wrap the sheet about the person, who is standing unclothed. The sheet\ncovers everything but the head and perhaps part of the neck. Than wrap a dry blanket\naround him. The person immediately gets into the bed, and is covered well with the top\nsheet and blankets. This is essentially something like a heating pack, but done only with a\nwet sheet. The effect is immediate freezing cold, which the body gradually warms. The\nperson can remain like this all night.\nIn the years that followed, the mother mentioned the incident to a number of medical people and doctors,\nwho were astounded; for everyone says there is no cure for emphysema.\n\nCauses\n\nThe word, \"emphysema,\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"to puff up with air.\" The\nwalls of the lungs lose their elasticity, so air cannot be easily pushed in and out, as should normally\nhappen. So there is air in the lungs, but it is not moving in and out. As emphysema progresses and there\nis more obstruction to airflow, the lungs enlarge with trapped air.\nThe most frequent cause is smoking, but air pollution also receives some of the blame. Live in the\ncountry and do not have tobacco in your home, and you should be able to avoid this problem.\nEmphysema has become the most common modern lung infection in the Western world. Needing a\ncontinual exchange of air to survive, we use about a thousand cubic feet of air each day. It passes over\nlung surfaces which, if laid flat, would be as large as a tennis court. In emphysema, a large portion of the\nalveoli (the grape-like sacs where the air exchange occurs) are destroyed, and the blood is not properly\naerated.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIt is only with great effort that the person can exhale air from his lungs. There is\ncontinual breathlessness. Most any exertion brings coughing. It is hard to breathe in, but worse to\nbreathe out. The neck veins often stand out from the effort, and he breathes through the mouth in order\nto try to get enough air in and out. Breathing is usually rapid and short. He may breathe 25-30 times a\nminute, and still not get enough air.\nEventually his chest becomes barrel-shaped, his face ruddy, and he speaks with short, broken phrases."},{"id":"disease-general-legionnaire-s-disease","title":"Legionnaire'S Disease","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Essentially follow the regime listed under \"Pneumonia\" and \"Bronchitis.\" See your\nhealth care provider.

(The full explanation is somewhat more complicated.)\nHardened walls produce higher blood pressure, but plaque-hardened and narrow vessels does it also.\nThe end result of both is a heart attack.\nThe main difference between the two is that arteriosclerosis is primarily the hardened walls themselves\n(which the plaque especially produced). Whereas atherosclerosis is the thickening of that plaque in the\narteries, so that the space for the blood to flow through keeps narrowing. In arteriosclerosis, these\ndeposits are primarily composed of calcium; in atherosclerosis, the deposits consist of fatty substances,\nprimarily cholesterol (a blood protein). But, much of the time, an odd assortment of both, along with\nlipoproteins, fatty acids, fibrous scar tissue, and blood clump together.\nBoth conditions have essentially the same effect on circulation, both cause hardening of the artery walls,\nboth cause high blood pressure, and both eventually lead to one or more of the same things: angina\n(which is chest pain following exertion), heart attack (the heart muscle can no longer bear the lack of\nblood supply to it), and stroke (when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off). Death may or may\nnot follow. The problem is that a clot of this plaque breaks loose, flows through the arteries, and gets\nstuck in a narrower artery. If this occurs in the heart muscle, angina and a heart attack may result; if in\nthe brain, a stroke occurs.\nTo complicate the matter further, not only can arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis cause high blood\npressure, but high blood pressure intensifies them both.\nCauses include elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels, eating high cholesterol foods (such as meat,\neggs, whole milk, or milk products).\nOther causes include smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, diabetes, emotional stress,\nlack of exercise, or a family history of the disease. Advancing age increases the risk factor.\nPain in the legs (usually in the calf, but sometimes in the feet or elsewhere in the legs), which increase\nwhen walking but stops as soon as one rests, is intermittent claudication (which see). There may also be\nweakness, numbness, and a heavy feeling in the legs. This is a symptom of atherosclerosis in the limbs\n(peripheral atherosclerosis). There can also, but less often, be pain in the arms.\nThere is a home test you can do to help determine if this is beginning to occur: Test the pulse in your\nlegs and foot. There are three places where this can be done: Apply light pressure on the top of the foot,\nthe inner hollow of the ankle, and in the hollow behind the knee. If you feel no pulse, then the artery\nmay be narrowing.\nAtherosclerosis is the most common form of arterial disease in the U.S. and most frequently occurs in\nthe lower limbs. It is the primary cause of death over the age of 65. Over 50% of the people between 65\nand 70 will die of some form of this.\n\nSymptoms\n\nEarly warning symptoms are intermittent claudication (which see). These are pains in\nthe legs and possibly feet, which leave upon resting. High blood pressure (see \"Hypertension\").

Problems are like a wall; you can go through\nthem, go over them, or go around them. You go through a problem when you eliminate it. You surmount\nan immediate problem when you figure out a way to sidestep it and still do what is needed. You go\naround it when you learn to live with an ongoing situation you cannot solve. You stop worrying about it\nor letting it bother you, and turn your attention to other things.\nHere are several basic suggestions:\n• Think positive in every situation. See a good side to it, and learn to make the best of it.\nSee it as an interesting challenge to solve difficulties. Trust in God to help you weather\nevery crisis and carry on through to the end.\nThink about something else for a time. That will help your brain to rest and your emotions\nto calm down. Gradually answers will come to mind.\n• Counsel with a good friend. If it is a problem with your husband, counsel with a woman,\nnot with a man. The same holds true for a man.\n• The primary problems in a person's life are employment, spouse, money, children,\ndeadlines, and guilt.\n• Sometimes you need to temporarily leave a threatening situation and get away and calm\ndown, take time to pray and rest your mind.\n• Stretching your muscles can help move a circulation made sluggish by the situation, so\nyou can think better. Massage muscles which have tensed up. Drop your jaw and move it\nleft to right. This helps relax the jaw muscle.\n• Take a hot bath; that really relaxes you, so you can start thinking constructively again.\n• Go outside and walk in the open air. Hold your head up, breath deeply, and relax.\n• Many times, the underlying need is to go to God and ask forgiveness, obey His Ten\nCommandment law, and start living a new, clean life. Make things right with those you\nhave wronged.\n• Believe that, with God's help, the situation can be dealt with.

This nerve comes out of the spine and a\nbranch runs down each leg, along the back of the thigh, down the inside of the leg, to the ankle.\nThere are two primary causes of sciatica:\nThe first is chilling the thigh over a lengthy period of time. The experts tell us that sciatica usually\nbegins as a neuralgia of the sciatic nerve. If you sit on cold surfaces a lot (steel folding chairs in cool\nrooms, or steel tree chairs while hunting, or steel boat seats while fishing, etc.) for lengthy periods of\ntime, you can irritate the sciatic nerve and produce sciatica.\nFortunately, this form of sciatica is quite easy to solve: Apply neuralgia-type treatments, and only sit on\nwarm surfaces or surfaces your body can heat relatively easily. Do not overlook chairs with foam that\nare too deep to easily warm up within a short time (say, 8 inches).\nOn your favorite chairs, place a folded, wool blanket or a piled thinner blanket. That is something you\ncan warm up. Experiment, and see what works best for you. If your body does not begin warming it up\nin a few minutes, lay something down that will.\nUnfortunately, there is a second, and much more serious, cause:\nThe second cause of sciatica is damage to the lower spine. There may be a history of an accident, a fall,\nthe lifting of a heavy weight, or a twist under some tension. Pain was first felt in the lower back. Later\n(weeks or even years later) pain begins to be felt at one or more places along the entire course of the\nsciatic nerve—back of the thigh, outer side of the calf, or in the top of the foot to the big toe.\nOne of the cartilaginous plates (disks, also spelled discs) in the lumbar region of the lower back has been\ndamaged. The cartilage bulges and later breaks, creating pressure backward against a nerve root. (It is\nalso possible for a tumor to develop and press against the sciatic nerve, but this is far less likely.)\nOther important facts are these: (1) The person probably was not maintaining a nourishing diet, with\nsupplemental calcium, and other bone-building factors. (2) He may have been overworking his body in\nrunning, weight-lifting, etc. (3) He was not lifting objects properly. (4) He was working at an\noccupation, such as lifting heavy patients in a nursing home, which is hazardous.\nIn older people who do not obtain enough bone-building materials in their diet, degenerative problems\ncan occur in newly formed spicules, or ridges, of bone. These may press on a nerve root.\nSome people derange their lower back by the simple method of always carrying a thick wallet in one\npants back pocket.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPain is noted down the back of the thigh, the outer side of the calf and along the outer\nside of the foot, or on the top of the foot to the big toe. The person compensates by placing more weight\non the other leg and foot. The pain is often worse at night and coughing, walking, heavy labor, or\nsneezing increases both the pain in the back and in the sciatic nerve.\nStill later, numbness may be felt when the hand is rubbed over the area where the pain is felt.\nLater still, a wasting of the muscles of the calf and a weakness in running and even walking may be\nnoticed."},{"id":"disease-general-brachial-neuralgia","title":"Brachial Neuralgia","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Back adjustments by a competent chiropractor may be the solution.\n• Keep the hands and arms warm at night, especially if there is a cool draft on the body.\n• Improve the diet. A good, nourishing diet which will build the nerves and bones is\nimportant. Raw green vegetables are needed, along with daily vitamin/mineral\nsupplements. A diet similar to that used in treating arthritis (which see) is helpful.\n• Maintain an ongoing exercise program, to strengthen the muscles of the shoulders and\narms and improve the posture: arm lifts, neck exercises, shoulder shrugs, horizontal upper\ntrunk push-ups, etc. Also helpful: swimming, ball throwing, and similar activities.\n• Avoid heavy lifting. When you have to lift, shrug first, and remain in a semi-shrugged\nposition while you lift. This will ward off nerve compression.\n(Thoracic Outlet Syndrome)\n\nCauses\n\nThis is to the shoulder, what sciatica is to the leg. A nerve, leading to the shoulder, is\npinched in the spine.\nBut it can also be caused by overworking of the arms, carrying excessively heavy weights, poor posture,\nand letting the arms and hands get cold at night. More rarely, there may be an abnormality in the seventh\ncervical rib.\nThe lower branch of the brachial plexus of nerves exits from the lower cervical vertebrae, then passes\nunderneath the clavicle and on into the arm. If this somehow experiences compression, the nerves to the\narm and hand will be affected.\nIt is best to solve this problem, since it is likely otherwise to gradually keep getting worse.\nA similar affliction is called the cervical rib syndrome. But it occurs more often in younger people, and\nproduces pain or numbness soon after heavy lifting, wearing a heavy coat, etc. The symptoms occur in\nthe day, not at night.\n\nSymptoms\n\nOne to three hours after falling asleep, there is a sense of pins, needles, numbness, and\npain in one or both hands. The discomfort generally wakes the person. There may be wasting in the\nsmall muscles in the hands, as well as coldness or swelling. It generally occurs among adults, not\nchildren.\nThe symptoms can eventually include the lower arm, upper arm, and even the shoulder, and are\ngenerally worse after a day of heavy lifting.\nDuring the day few symptoms are present, unless heavy lifting occurs."},{"id":"disease-general-multiple-neuritis","title":"Multiple Neuritis","lang":"en","text":"(J.H.

Here are several suggestions, to help you strengthen your nerves. This is a building\nprogram:\nThe vitamin B complex (100 mg per day; best taken as 50 mg twice a day) is especially important in\nmaintaining good nerve action and response. Deficiencies of the B complex are common among people\neating modern, devitalized, processed, and assorted junk foods. Take a good vitamin/mineral supplement\nat least twice a day. It should include all the B vitamins.\nVitamin B , also called thiamine (100 mg, twice a day) is especially needed for neuritis.\n1\nVitamin B (niacin, 50 mg twice a day). Do not take more than 100 mg of niacin a day. Niacinamide is\n3\nequivalent to niacin, and does not produce the flushed face which niacin does.\nVitamin B (2,000 mcg, twice a day).\n12\nVitamin B (250-500 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for carpal tunnel syndrome.\n6\nFolic acid (400-800 mcg, daily).\nInositol (1000 mg, 1-2 times a day), especially for diabetic neuropathy.\nIn addition to the above B vitamins, also take Vitamin C with bioflavonoids (3,000-6,000 mg daily,\nwhen you have a nerve crisis).\nVitamin E (400 IU, 2-3 times a day), especially with post-herpes syndrome.\nVitamin A (5,000 IU, a day), but not over 10,000 IU a day if you are pregnant. It is best to take vitamin\nA supplementation in the form of beta-carotene.\nMinerals include calcium (400 mg, 2-3 times daily), magnesium (200 mg, 2-3 times a day), zinc (50-80\nmg daily, not to exceed 100 mg daily from all supplements), and iodine.\nEssential fatty acids, obtained from 1-2 tbsp. of cold pressed oils daily. Never put it into your cooking;\ninstead, put it on your food after the plate is served.\nFresh and steamed vegetables are rich in minerals which are needed for the nervous system and brain.\nBrewer's yeast, kelp or dulse, lecithin, and wheat germ oil are very helpful. Eat regularly, chew slowly,\nand do not overeat.\nOctocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.\nIncrease your fluid intake.\nObtain enough rest at night and avoid sexual enervation. Medical professionals know that such\nenervation is one of the quickest ways to produce weakened, degenerate, and diseased nerve tissue.\nA good balance between exercise and rest has a powerful effect in building the body, if a nutritious diet\nis maintained.\nAvoid stimulants and all processed, refined, and junk foods.\nCool and cold water treatments will help tone and strengthen the nerves.\nThe nervine herbs include skullcap, hop, chamomile, valerian, dong quai, wood betony, passion flower,\nlady's slipper, mistletoe, and small amounts of lobelia.\nReviewing some of the nutrients needed, as they apply to the brain, we learn this:\nThere is a direct relation between the transverse colon and the brain. When the colon is clogged, mental\nillness is triggered in some and an attack of epilepsy (which see) in others.\nEliminate the \"glue foods\"; these tend to clog the colon, produce a buildup of mucous and toxins in it,\nand lead to mental problems. Such foods include White flour, sugar, eggs, meat, peanuts, and dairy\nproducts.\nA high carbohydrate (whole grain) diet stimulates the amount of tryptophane in the brain, and produces\na calming, peaceful feeling.\nBrain cells cannot function properly without proper nutrients.\nDeficiencies of the B complex and vitamin C decrease the metabolic rate of the brain. Lack of niacin can\nproduce deep depression, often seen in psychosis. Symptoms of a severe vitamin B deficiency are\n6\nheadache, irritability, dizziness, extreme nervousness, and inability to concentrate. Pantothenic acid\n(another B vitamin) is needed to handle stressful situations. A thiamine deficiency results in a lack of\nenergy, constant fatigue, loss of appetite, and irritability; if this continues too long, there are emotional\nupsets and overreaction to normal stress. Lack of vitamin C leads to irritability.\nAdequate calcium in the diet is vital. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for ways to maintain enough calcium\nin the body. Inadequate calcium results in insomnia, tenseness, and fatigue.\nCalcium and magnesium protect the nerves from damage.\nToo much copper in the body occurs in schizophrenia, and can be reduced by dietary intake of zinc and\nmanganese. Vitamin C deficiency can cause copper retention which accumulates in the brain and liver.\nVitamin B complex (especially B , B , B and folic acid) reduces excess estrogen from the liver and\n3 6 12,\nprevents it from causing mental troubles.\nMany of the schizophrenias, autism, abnormal behavior, and subsequent learning disorders are caused\nby too much lead or copper in the body. Check your plumbing pipes. Plastic water pipes are the safest.\nA person with a magnesium deficiency tends to be uncooperative, withdraw, apathetic, or belligerent.\nIt is vital to obtain enough oxygen, if you want a clear mind which functions properly. Vitamin E helps\nthe brain obtain enough oxygen from the amount supplied to the lungs.\nA lack of thyroxine, the hormone from the thyroid, results in a slowing of physical and mental functions.\nHyperthyroidism is related to emotional disturbance, forgetfulness, slow thought processes, and\nirritability.\nWhen the adrenals do not function properly, depression and other forms of mental illness may result.\nExercise, especially out-of-doors in the fresh air, combined with relaxation helps rejuvenate the body\nand mind.\nGinkgo biloba improves brain function and cerebral circulation, and enhances memory."},{"id":"disease-general-seasonal-affective-syndrome","title":"Seasonal Affective Syndrome","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• In most cases, an improvement in diet will greatly help. Foods rich in the B complex are\nneeded, along with fresh fruit and vegetables. The nervous system needs to be built up\nwith better food.\n• Negative attitudes are also powerful. Train your mind to be thankful for the blessings\nyou have.\n• If possible, obtain a full-spectrum light for your dining room and work area.\n\nCauses\n\nThis condition, also called the \"winter blues\", is caused by several factors:\nThe winter months bring dark and dreary overcast days, and this emotionally bothers some people more\nthan others.\nThe winter months have shorter hours of daylight and more overcast skies during the daytime, resulting\nin less light entering the eyes. This light deficiency sends signals to the pineal, pituitary, and\nhypothalamus glands; and they do not function as fully as usual.\nThere is often more stress and greater nutritional deficiencies in the winter. Less fresh fruit and\nvegetables may be available.\nAll this combines, in some, to produce seasonal affective syndrome. In our waking hours, we need\nsunlight every so often. We have a friend who, moving to Labrador, on the eastern Canadian coast,\ncould not tolerate the incessant dreary fog, and moved away within a year.\n\nSymptoms\n\nWithdrawal, social isolation, depression, cravings, weight gain, loss of energy,\noversleep, decreased sexual desire."},{"id":"disease-general-tennis-elbow","title":"Tennis Elbow","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• For 3-4 days, do not do the types of activities which cause the pain.\n• Apply cold or hot to the affected area, according to which helps you best: Apply ice on\nthe affected area for 30-90 minutes each day; the more the pain, the longer the application.\nOr apply heat, especially after the first few day.\n• Careful exercise is also needed, to eliminate tennis elbow; rest is not enough. The\ntendons need to be strengthened. Purchase a hand gripper at a sporting goods store, and\nslowly increase your usage of it until you are using it 5-10 minutes, 4 times a day. When\nyou use it, the elbow should be straight and the wrist bent. This will stretch the extensor\ntendons and help strengthen the fibrous tendons.\n• Other exercises are also helpful. Place your forearm on a table, palm down, and grip a 3-\npound dumbbell. Flex the wrist upward slightly; hold for 5 seconds, lower and rest for 3\nseconds. When you can easily do this 15 times, increase the weight by 1 pound. Over a\nperiod of 4-6 weeks of doing this every day, you may be able to move up to 8-10 pounds\nlifted without pain. Medical Tribune (January 12, 1977) reported that 14 of 18 patients, on\na four-week program with this exercise, obtained complete pain relief.\n• Athletes sometimes place a band several inches wide around the forearm near the elbow,\nand another just above the wrist. Be sure they are not too tight.\n• Avoid cortisone injections, for these can produce tendon atrophy or even dissolve it!\n—Also see \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.\"\n\nCauses\n\nTennis elbow is an occupational and recreational problem. Those who do a lot of hand-\ngripping can have this disorder. This would include golfers, carpenters, factory workers, housewives,\nand even politicians who shake hands a lot.\nThe weakness occurs when gripping an object, and is not a true muscle weakness. The tendons are\ninvolved.\n\nSymptoms\n\nTenderness and pain in the elbow, weakness in the hand."},{"id":"disease-general-carpal-tunnel-syndrome","title":"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• As soon as the tingling begins, begin doing some gentle hand exercises. Rotate the wrist\nin a circle for 2 minutes. This exercises all the muscles of the wrist, restores circulation,\nand gets your wrist out of the position that usually causes the trouble.\n• Raise your hands above your head and rotate your arms while rotating your wrists at the\nsame time. Also do some neck turns; look over your right, then left, shoulder. Learn to\nexercise and relax as you work.\n• Vitamin B helps eliminate the problem.\n6\n• Eat half a fresh pineapple daily, for 1-3 weeks. The bromelain in it will reduce swelling\nand pain.\n• Eat only moderate amounts of oxalic acid foods (beets, beet greens, sorrel, Swiss chard,\ncabbage family, eggs, parsley, asparagus.). Avoid spinach, and especially rhubarb. Fish\nhave oxalic acid also.\n• Avoid salt and all sodium foods, for they promote water retention.\n• Try to reduce the impact of repetitive mechanical tasks on your wrists and hands. If\npossible, stop all such movements for several days and see if improvement occurs. If so,\ntry to do these functions less frequently. If possible, rotate your duties, so you do not do\nthose repetitive tasks every day.\n• Keep your weight down. Extra weight puts more pressure on the carpal tunnel.\n• Keep your arms close to your body and your wrists straight while sleeping. For example,\nif you let your hand drop over the side of the bed while you are sleeping, the pressure on\nthe median nerve is increased.\n• You might wish to temporarily wear a wrist splint at night. This helps keep the wrist\nstraight.\n• Do not wrap your wrist in an Ace bandage. This could cut off the circulation.\n• If you have to carry something, make the sure the handle is the right size. If it is too\nsmall or large, it could hurt your wrist.\n• Aloe vera, yarrow, and yucca help restore flexibility and reduce inflammation. Skullcap\nrelieves muscle spasms and pain. Wintergreen oil reduces pain and aids circulation to the\nmuscles.\nPREVENTION—Carpal tunnel syndrome is a problem which many can develop in our time. Here are\nseveral suggestions for avoiding its occurrence:\n• Use a tool instead of flexing your wrists forcibly.\n• Use your whole hand and all your fingers when you grip an object.\n• In doing a task, use your whole arm, not just your wrist. For example, when hammering,\nswing your arm rather than just your wrist.\n• Maintain good posture and keep your elbows bent when typing, writing, etc. What is the\nideal position? Cock your wrist back slightly, so that your thumb is parallel to your\nforearm. Your hand should be in approximately the same position as if it were holding a\npen. This position keeps the carpal tunnel as open as possible. Place a wrist pad on the\ntable, just in front of the keyboard.\n• Before starting handwork, exercise the fingers and wrists for a couple minutes, to warm\nthem up. Take a break from handwork every hour. Shake out your hands every so often\nthroughout the day.\n—Also see \"Tennis Elbow.\"\n\nCauses\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a cumulative trauma disorder that develops over time, due\nto repeated stressful movements of the hands and wrist. It affects 23,000 workers a year. The median\nnerve in the wrist is compressed or damaged. This nerve controls the thumb muscles and sensation in the\nthumb, palm, and first three fingers. The median nerve passes through a very small opening, about a\nquarter inch below the top of the wrist.\nEither compression or injury to this nerve can cause problems: Pressure from the bone spurs\ninflammatory arthritis or tendonitis, swelling due to pregnancy or water retention.\nOther causes include repeated stressful motions, such as writing, typing, or hammering. Bookkeepers\nand checkout clerks can develop it; so can hairstylists, musicians, writers, drivers, athletes, restaurant\nservers, and jack hammer and chain-saw operators. The occurrence of CTS has greatly increased since\nthe 1980s, when personal computers came into use. The tendons swell and compress the median nerve\nthat runs to your hand, causing great pain. A common pattern is rapid and continuous use of the fingers,\nproducing a repetitive wrist motion injury. Women between 29 and 62 experience CTS more often than\nanyone else.\nRaynaud's disease, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and menopause increase the risk of developing\nCTS.\nOther disorders, especially arthritis in the neck, have similar symptoms. But, if the first three fingers in\none or both hands are affected by the pain, then it is probably CTS.\n\nSymptoms\n\nMild numbness and faint tingling to excruciating pain, but generally only burning,\ntingling, or numbness in the thumb and first three fingers. Crippling atrophy of the thumb can result.\nSymptoms are often worse at night or in the morning. The pain may eventually spread to the arm and\nshoulder. Symptoms normally affect only one hand, but may be present in both."},{"id":"disease-general-convulsions","title":"Convulsions","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Loosen the clothing and give plenty of fresh air. If the cause is undetermined, keep him\nfrom injuring himself. Place a soft pad between his teeth, to avoid biting his tongue or\ncheeks.\n• If an infant, put him in a bath of 95o F. or in mustard and water bath at 85o F. Cold\nshould be applied to the head. The cause must first be found, or injury may result from the\nbath. If fever is present, it should be a tepid or cool bath.\n• Produce vomiting by placing the finger down the throat. If gums are hot and swollen,\ngive cold water and rub gums with a cloth that has been held on ice.\n• The bowels should be emptied immediately with an enema. Take some laxative herbs, to\nclean out the small intestine. Fast on fruit juices, water, or nervine herb teas (listed below)\nuntil all symptoms subside. Keep the body warm.\n• After this, rest in bed, absolutely quiet; give careful diagnosis without disturbing him.\n• One successful method of therapy has been the injection in 1 large dose of 600,000 IU of\nvitamin D. This helps the utilization of calcium.\n• Take calcium (2,000 mg, daily) and magnesium (1,000 mg, daily) supplements. Also B\n6\n(100 mg, twice a day) and chromium (75-100 mcg, 3 times a day).\n• Helpful herbs include catnip, skullcap, and peony. Two cups of valerian root may be\ntaken every 2 hours after the convulsions. Antispasmodic tincture (which see) is best and\nworks faster.\n• Other useful herbs include rue, black cohosh, valerian, vervain, peppermint, chamomile,\nwild cherry bark, goldenseal, and a little cayenne.\n• One Central American naturopath says that, over the years, he has treated a thousand\ncases of convulsions—and fully one-half were caused by parasites. Other important\ncauses are constipation and wrong diet. He puts them on a cleansing and building\nprogram, discarding all meat eating, and requiring that they never return to it (so they will\nnot again become infested with worms).\n• If parasites are the cause, use garlic enemas, plus eat garlic (see \"Worms\" for more\ninformation).\n• There is a definite possibility, especially in children, that a food allergy is involved, very\npossibly accompanied by malnutrition (maybe partially caused by being fed too much\njunk food and soft drinks). After the convulsion is past, begin testing with pulse tests for\nfood allergies (see \"Pulse Test\").\n• If it should be a spasm of asthma, take 8 drops of antispasmodic tincture (which see) or\ninhale eucalyptus oil.\n• If it is a muscle spasm, wring a towel out of hot water and lay it on the area.\n• A coughing spasm can be relieved by the tincture or an emetic.\n—Also see \"Antispasmodic Tincture\" and \"Epilepsy.\"\n(Spasms, Seizures, Fits)\n\nCauses\n\nConvulsions are uncontrolled body movements set off by an electrical malfunction of the\nbrain.\nConvulsions can be caused by epilepsy, meningitis, tetanus, uremia, hysteria, or eclampsia. They can\nalso be induced by poisoning from camphor, cyanide, strychnine, santonin, brucine, or aspidium.\nIn children the cause is often wrong diet, rickets, syphilis, malaria, toxemias, or acute infectious\ndiseases.\nIn adults, the cause is often epilepsy, heat cramps, strychnine, or food poisoning.\nConvulsions, due to tetanus and hydrophobia, are easily distinguished and, for the most part, involve a\nsmall portion of the voluntary muscles. Strychnine poisoning causes spasms which involve the whole\nbody.\nHigh fevers of 104o-105o F. are often a cause of convulsions in children.\n\nSymptoms\n\nParoxysms of involuntary muscular contractions and relaxations, which occur most\nfrequently in children."},{"id":"disease-general-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis","title":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","lang":"en","text":"(J.H.

In addition, the thin membranes that cover the spinal cord may also be\ninfected. It is a contagious disease.\nCauses include several different viruses (including those causing polio, measles, rubella, fungi, yeast\ninfection) and several types of bacteria.\nInfection can spread from the nose and throat to the meninges. A depleted immune system (along with\nnose and throat trouble) can cause it to enter the blood stream and go to the brain.\nIf not treated properly, a case of flu or ear, nose, and throat infections can develop into meningitis.\nEating heavy meals or taking drugs while sick can cause an infection to drive deeper into the system and\nenter the brain area.\nOther factors aiding in the development of meningitis are alcoholism, brain surgery, brain cancer,\nexposure to chemical agents, head injury, pneumonia, Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, or anything\nthat weakens the immune system (chemotherapy, radiation treatment, steroid therapy, HIV infection,\nand certain types of cancer).\nOf the three main types of meningitis, viral infection is more common and produces milder symptoms,\nsuch as malaise and headache, which generally clears up on its own in a week or two.\nBut the bacterial type requires prompt, aggressive treatment—or brain damage or death can result. (Any\ntime a bacterial infection occurs [such as strep throat or an ear infection], eliminate it; do not ignore the\nproblem.)\nFungal meningitis progresses more slowly, but also requires medical care.\nDo not guess! Call a physician!\nMeningitis is more common in children than adults.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms vary considerably, but usually include a sore throat, fever, headache, stiff\nneck, and vomiting. Children and adults can become critically ill in 6-24 hours after the first appearance\nof the symptoms. This condition requires rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Take him to the\nemergency room immediately! Demand immediate help!\nSymptoms include sore throat, red or purple skin rash, fever, chills, malaise, headaches, vomiting,\nsensitivity to light, nausea, delirium, stiff neck, and convulsions.\nIn infants: vomiting, fever, difficult feeding, irritability, a high-pitched cry, a bulging fontanel (soft spot\non top of the head).

The name means \"muscle weakness.\"\nAdolescents and young adults, especially women, are the most likely to have this problem. But it\nsometimes occurs in newborn infants and adults over 40. In the latter case, a tumor in the thymus is\ninvolved. It rarely occurs past 50.\nThe muscles of the face and neck are primarily involved, but those in the trunk and extremities may also\nbe involved.\nSome cases are mild; others are rapidly fatal. When the respiratory system is involved, death is much\nmore likely to result from this disease. Progress of the disorder is variable, and prolonged remission may\noccur.\nIt is thought to be an autoimmune disease that causes malfunctioning of the enzyme, acetylcholine,\nwhich is responsible for inducing muscles to contract. (It is conjectured that there may also be an excess\nof cholinesterase at the myoneural junction in which the nerve impulses fail to induce normal muscle\ncontractions, but this is less likely.)\nThere is a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. Either the\nacetylcholine release is not adequate or the muscle response to the acetylcholine is not sufficient. An\nautoimmune factor may be involved (i.e., there are so many toxins in the body, that the system interferes\nwith normal functions.)\nAutointoxication may thus be a primary cause. Toxins accumulate in the bloodstream from chemicals,\nchronic constipation, etc. Either they destroy the muscular system or they trigger other body systems to\ndo so.\nChronic constipation can cause the cecum to press against the ileocecal valve, releasing poisons of the\ncolon back into the small intestine. This is a dangerous situation, since toxins in the small intestine are\nabsorbed into the blood far more quickly than when they are in the colon.\n\nSymptoms\n\nMuscular weakness, fatigue, emotional stress, and droopy eyelids. Difficulty in\nbreathing, swallowing, and speaking.\nThe onset is gradual, and the symptoms are worse in the evening. The person complains of difficulty in\nchewing, swallowing, and talking."},{"id":"disease-general-parkinson-s-disease","title":"Parkinson'S Disease","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• It is very important that the person afflicted with Parkinson's disease keep active.\nMuscles which are not used atrophy more quickly. The person's own determination and\nfaithfulness in an exercise program will forestall the progress of the disease better than\nalmost anything else. Every exercise keeps the muscles more useful. Use a wide variety of\nsimple exercises! Buy a book on weight lifting; but, of course, use much smaller weights.\nSwing the arms forcefully when walking. Exercises involving joint movements (including\nthe neck) are very important.\n• Keep the feet a distance apart, when walking, and take short steps, when turning.\n• Typing, writing, working with clay, etc., helps the fingers.\n• Breathe deeply in and out.\n• Take frequent rest periods.\n• Read aloud, to keep the mouth muscles in good condition.\n• Any act difficult to perform should be done daily.\n• A nutritious diet, adequate rest, exercise in the open air, enough fluids, and sunlight help\nslow the effects of Parkinson's disease.\n• Octocosanol is found in wheat germ oil. It helps the neuron membranes.\n• Eat foods and take supplements containing antioxidants. The most important of these is\nvitamin E (3,200 IU daily!) and vitamin C (3,000 mg daily!). This can slow the\nprogression of Parkinson's disease by 2-3 years! Theoretically, a person who takes\nsignificant dosage levels will never contract Parkinson's disease in the first place. It\nappears that free-radical damage may be a major cause of damage of dopamine-producing\nbrain cells.\n• Iron supplementation seems to help in some cases. The production of tyrosine, an\nenzyme involved in dopa production (the precursor of dopamine), is stimulated by iron\nsupplementation in the diet.\n• Here are some additional helps and dosages of worthwhile natural substances:\noctocosanol (300 mcg, three times a day), Neuro-Gen leucine (10 gm/day), l-methionine\n(5 gm/day), essential fatty acids (1tbsp., twice a day), ltyrosine (100 mg/day), dl-\nphenoalanine (100 mg, three times a day), B (200 mg, three times a day), B (100 mg,\n1 6\nthree times a day), betaine HCl (75-200 mg three times a day before meals).\n• Overweight is a problem; take the extra weight off.\n• Ingestion of aluminum is a factor in Alzheimer's disease, and it may also be involved in\nParkinson's disease. Do not use aluminum cookware or use deodorants containing it (alum\nis aluminum). Also avoid lead. Some people with Parkinson's disease have high levels of\nlead in their brains.\n• L-dopa (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine), in form of the drug brand, Levodopa, is a synthetic\ndopamine which is given to patients, to supply the missing dopamine. Intriguingly\nenough, actual dopamine (from animal sources) cannot be given, because there is a blood-\nbrain barrier rejecting it. So levodopa is given, which is accepted (through conversion to\ndopamine in the basal ganglion).\n• But two facts should be noted: (1) Vitamin B reverses the effects of levodopa, so efforts\n6\nmust be made to eliminate B from the diet. (Eat in moderation bananas, oatmeal, peanuts,\n6\nwhole grains, potatoes, meat, and fish and only eat protein foods in the evening.) (2)\nLevodopa usually produces side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, insomnia, mental\nconfusion, and agitation, as well as liver and kidney damage.\n• L-dopa and carbidopa can aggravate and speed up the progress of Parkinson's disease in\nmany cases, and is said to have little beneficial effect in over half the cases.\n(Shaking Palsy, Paralysis agitans,\nParkinsonianism)\n\nCauses\n\nParkinson's disease is a gradual degeneration of the nervous system. The nerve cells in the\nbasal ganglion of the brain are gradually destroyed.\nParkinson's disease is one of the most common debilitating diseases in the United States. But actual\ndisability usually does not occur for 10-15 years after onset of symptoms.\nAlthough the underlying cause is not known, symptoms appear when there is a lack of dopamine in the\nbrain. Dopamine is made by the body, and carries messages from one nerve cell to another. Normally,\nanother neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is made, to keep dopamine in balance. When there is not enough\nacetylcholine, myasthenia gravis occurs; when there is not enough dopamine, the result is Parkinson's\ndisease.\nIn Parkinson's, the problem generally is destruction of the cells which make dopamine. But sometimes\nthe cause is blockage of the dopamine receptors in the brain.\nOne possible cause of this disorder is that too many toxins have been released in the body for the blood\nto filter out through the liver. An excess of chemicals, drugs, toxins in meat eating, etc., are thought to\nbe involved. It is known that one of the chemicals in heroine directly destroys the key brain cells\npreventing Parkinson's. A chronic poor diet, over many years, is also considered to be a significant\nfactor.\n\nSymptoms\n\nInitially: mild to moderate tremor of the hand or hands while at rest, a feeling of being\nslow and heavy, tendency to tire more easily, muscular stiffness, loss of skill in the fingers and thumb\n(writing, buttoning and unbuttoning, playing the piano, etc.)\nLater: depression, loss of appetite, muscular rigidity, permanent rigid stoop, shuffling gait, drooling,\ntremors, fixed facial expression, and impaired speech. Ability to maintain balance may be affected.\nThe body gradually becomes rigid as limbs stiffen. Dementia may occur.\nPrinciple signs are tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, and slow or retarded movement. Tremors and\nslowness generally begin in one limb, then progress to the other limb on the same side; later still to the\nother side. Usually the hands are affected before the feet."},{"id":"disease-general-polio","title":"Polio","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• In the late 1940s, Benjamin Sandler, M.D., was interviewed on the radio in the spring,\njust before the summer polio season. He declared that, if sugar foods and especially Cokes\nand soft drinks were avoided, polio would not be contracted. This went into the\nnewspapers and the East Coast area covered by the announcement had very little polio\nthat summer. Later, Sandler wrote a book detailing his concept.\nSugar injures the nerves; calcium is needed by the nerves; highly acid substances remove\ncalcium; phosphorous locks with calcium and carries it off, making it unavailable. Coca\nCola-type drinks combine all these special qualities! The liquid in Coke is more acid than\nvinegar, yet is not noticed because of the very high sugar content. Coke is phosphoric\nacid. So the sugar and acid eat away the calcium, and the phosphorus immediately locks\ninto it. A tooth, dropped in a glass of Coke, will melt away in a matter of hours.\n• Another factor is being cold. People drink Cokes and other soft drinks at swimming\npools, then jump and in and vigorously swim in the cold water. So many people contract\npolio at swimming pools in the summer that it is suspected that there must be something\nin the pool water. But the problem is the soft drinks, not contaminated pool water.\n• The body is adapted to the intense heat of mid-summer; but poor diet plus soft drinks\nweaken it, then the cold plunge intensifies the effects.\n• Because it was so dangerous to the health, Coca Cola was banned from interstate\ncommerce by the original Food and Drug Administration early in the 20th century. That is\nwhy, to this day, Cokes and Pepsi's are made in local bottling plants. The syrup is shipped\ninterstate, and then, with water, is poured into bottles.\n• Franklin D. Roosevelt was very athletic. He fought a forest fire near his home, ate some\njunk food, and jumped in an ice-cold river to cool off. He then came down with polio.\n• Another factor is keeping the body warm.\n• As soon as a person comes down with polio, he is placed in bed and observed. —But,\nwhat should be done is to place him immediately in a warm, full bathtub or, better, give\nhim the \"Kenny packs.\"\n• Nurse Kenny (called Sister Kenny, because nurses in Australia are called \"sister\")\napplied hot packs to the patients (on parts, or all, of their bodies), and eliminated polio\nwith few or no after effects. But this water therapy method was not permitted in America.\nIt was too effective.\nOther factors:\n• During the infectious stage, keep the diet high in protein and potassium, to replace that\nwhich is lost because of tissue destruction.\n• Fluid, caloric, and sodium intake should also be increased because of the fever.\nAdditional B vitamins are also needed, along with vitamins A and C.\n• Give antispasmodic tincture (which see). Give doses (according to age) of 8-15 drops in\n1/4th glass of hot water.\n• Helpful herbs include prickly ash berries, wild cherry bark, valerian root, skullcap,\ngoldenseal, black cohosh, red clover, catnip, and yellow dock.\n• Dr. Salk, himself (developer of injectable polio vaccine), warned against the serious\ndangers in taking oral polio vaccine! Beware of oral polio vaccine! In the latter part of the\n20th century, oral polio vaccine has produced more cases of polio than any other agency.\n• In addition, there is extreme danger in handling the bowel movement of an infant who\nhas received the oral polio vaccine! You can get crippling polio from doing so.\n• Medical history reveals that people who were vegetarians, did not eat junk foods, or\ndrink soft drinks, but lived a clean life—and avoided polio vaccines; and those recently\nreceiving them—have rarely contracted polio.\n(Poliomyelitis, Infantile Paralysis)\n\nCauses\n\nPoliomyelitis means \"gray marrow,\" and is inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal\ncord. The condition is not confined to infancy, nor is paralysis always involved. Polio is a virus infection\nof the spinal cord which destroys the nerves controlling muscular movement, often resulting in paralysis\nof certain muscles.\nThe first of two stages of polio is the infectious stage, when the virus is active. The second is the\nnoninfectious stage, when recovery may occur.\nParalysis may be confined to a small part of the body or much, or nearly all, of it. But muscle atrophy\nmay also occur. Death usually only occurs in bulbar and respiratory cases. Aside from\nbronchopneumonia, other complications are relatively few.\nEpidemics, when they occur, usually reach their peak during the warmest months (July and August).\n\nSymptoms\n\nFever, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and irritability.\nIncubation is generally 2-7 days, and onset is often abrupt.

Memory and thought processes\nare weakened and disoriented.\nNerve fibers, leading into, and out of, the hippocampus in the brain become tangled and short circuited.\nAs a result, information is no longer carried to, and from, the brain. New memories cannot be gained,\nand old memories cannot be retrieved.\nIn addition, plaques of a certain protein (beta-amyloid) build up in the brain, damaging nerve cells.\nOne form of Alzheimer's occurs between 36 and 45, and is quite rapid. The more gradual form develops\nin those who are 65 or 70.\nSimple forgetfulness is not Alzheimer's. If you do not remember your wife's name, that is forgetfulness;\nif you forget you have a wife, that is dementia (of which Alzheimer's is a form).\nThere are other disorders which produce similar symptoms: Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries),\nwhich slowly reduces blood flow to the brain; a series of minor strokes; hypothyroidism; advanced\nsyphilis.\nMany elderly people are taking 8 or 10 medicinal drugs. This drugging will surely affect the brain. You\ncan see the effects in nursing homes across the continent. Add to this a devitalized diet of fried,\nprocessed, and junk food.\nOther causes include heavy metals in the body. One in particular stands out: When you hear the words,\n\"Alzheimer's disease,\" think of it as \"aluminum disease,\" for this is what it often is.\nAutopsies on persons who died with Alzheimer's reveal accumulations of up to 4 times the normal\namount of aluminum in the nerve cells of the brain. Significantly, especially high concentrations are in,\nand around, the hippocampus.\n(See \"Aluminum Poisoning\" for much more information.)\nBut those with Alzheimer's also have high levels of mercury in their brain. Beware of amalgam dental\nfillings. Mercury from the fillings gradually passes into the body and, over a period of time, accumulates\nin the brain.\nObtaining an adequate supply of minerals in the diet helps keep heavy metals from accumulating in the\nbody.\nWomen with Alzheimer's have lower estrogen levels than normal.\nFree radicals are another factor. Avoid foods which contain them.\nThose with Alzheimer's have low levels of vitamin B and zinc in their bodies. All the B complex\n12\nvitamins are important.\nVitamins A and E, important antioxidant vitamins, are also important.\nLevels of choline and ethanolamine are lower in those with Alzheimer's.\nUndergo a trial of intensive nutritional therapy, especially B injections. This may ward off the\n12\ndeveloping problem.\nThose with Alzheimer's tend to have a strong craving for sweets. But such a craving is frequently an\nindication of a food hunger for vitamins and minerals.\nSome people with Down's syndrome (which see) live to be in their 30s or 40s; they usually develop\nAlzheimer's.\n\nSymptoms\n\nDisoriented perceptions of space and time, inability to concentrate or communicate, and\nmemory loss.\nThis produces depression, agitation, withdrawal, insomnia, irritability, memory loss, personality\nchanges, severe mood swings, and senility.\nAn intriguing early warning sign has been discovered at the San Diego Medical Center: As much as 2\nyears before mental decline, those with Alzheimer's begin to lose their sense of smell. The rate at which\nthe ability to distinguish strong odors diminishes is an indicator of how rapidly an individual will lose\nmental functioning.

Depression is a mental state\ncharacterized by dejection, lack of hope, and absence of cheerfulness.\nBoth of these qualities are strikingly observed in manic depression. Manic depression is cyclic, or\ncircular affective psychosis, in which there are alternating moods of depression and mania. Ordinarily\nthere is a series of periods of psychotic depression or excessive well-being, appearing in any sequence\nand alternating with longer periods of relative normalcy.\nThough intensity may vary greatly, the manic shows an elevated though unstable mood, a flight of ideas,\nand great physical activity. The case of primary depression finds one thinking that all exertion is\nexhausting. There is difficulty in thinking or acting and the person is very unhappy.\nManic-depressive disorder is also called bipolar disorder. It typically begins as depression and then\ndevelops into alternating periods of depression and mania.\nBoth mania and depression can vary in intensity and length of the cycles (a few days to many months).\nDuring the depression phase, some do nothing while others go through the motions of everyday work\nwhile always feeling depressed.\nHypomania is a burst of energy and activity, but full-blown manic psychosis includes delusions of\ngrandeur, invincibility, or persecution, and may result in day and night activity without sleep.\nFactors inducing manic depression include an overgrowth of yeast in the intestinal tract, food allergies,\nenvironmental sensitivities, and certain diseases: hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes,\nAlzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nExtreme pessimism, withdrawal from society, changes in sleep patterns.

The earlier name for it was dementia praecox.\nThere are four primary types. A vague sense of being two personalities and \"changed\" occurs in all\ntypes:\n1 - Simple schizophrenia: The person becomes dull emotionally, loses ambition, and tends to withdraw.\nYet there is no serious intellectual impairment.\n2 - Paranoid schizophrenia: The person develops extensive delusions of persecution. He believes people\nare plotting against him.\n3 - Catatonic schizophrenia: The person may show stereotyped excitement or simulate a stupor. But he\nwill clearly remember it, if he later recovers.\n4 - Hebephrenic schizophrenia: There are mannerisms, speech anomalies, hysteroid symptoms,\ndelusions, hallucinations, and often a dreamy, ineffectual reaction.\nSome believe schizophrenia is hereditary; others think that only attitudinal, dietetic, and external factors\nlead to it (head injuries, complications during birth, reaction to a virus or medicinal drug, environmental\npoisons).\nA wide range of medicinal drugs can produce schizoid symptoms. It is known that many schizophrenics\nhad birth complications or a head injury in childhood.\nSchizophrenia is also linked to an excess of copper in the body. High copper levels cause vitamin C and\nzinc levels to drop. It is believed that a zinc deficiency may be a key factor inducing schizophrenia. A\nfull 80% of those with this disorder have a deficiency of zinc and an excess of copper and iron in their\nbody tissues. Supplementation of zinc and manganese are needed to correct this.\nZinc deficiencies occur more frequently in the winter, and this is when this disorder frequently begins.\nIt is now known that some individuals who, later in life are schizophrenic, had a prenatal zinc\ndeficiency, from their mother's diet and way of life.\nThe pineal gland in the brain normally has high levels of zinc, and weakening of this endocrine gland\nmay be a factor.\nMagnesium deficiency may also be involved, since schizophrenics have lower magnesium levels in their\nblood; and, when they recover from it, their magnesium levels are higher.\nHypoglycemia appears to be frequently involved in schizophrenia. A fair level supply of blood sugar is\nvital, if oxygen is going to be regularly provided to the brain. Yet it is believed that an undersupply of\noxygen is a key factor inducing the disorder. (See \"Hypoglycemia.\")\nHigh-quality food, with emphasis on slow-to-digest whole grain products, should be eaten.\nMineral and trace mineral imbalances exist in schizophrenics. A nourishing diet, along with vitamin/\nmineral supplementation is needed.\nSevere vitamin B (niacin) deficiency (pellagra), with its characteristics such as nervousness, loss of\n3\nmemory, confusion, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and hallucinations—resembles schizophrenia so\nclosely, that the two disorders probably are the same.\nHere is an interesting fact: When experiments were made on prisoners, and they were given no niacin\nfor extended periods of time before they were again given normal diets, it required 60 times as much\nniacin to return them to normal, in order to prevent pellagra.\nSevere deficiencies of other B complex vitamins can also produce schizoid symptoms. Severe B\n12\ndeficiency caused difficulty in concentration, poor memory, agitation, hallucinations, and manic or\nparanoid behavior. Biotin deficiency causes depression, lassitude, panic, and hallucinations.\nFaulty essential fatty acid metabolism or deficiency is another factor leading to schizophrenia. The\nremedy was 2-6 tbsp. of linseed oil, in divided doses, given daily. Flaxseed oil, wheat germ oil, or\nsunflower seed oil work just as effectively.\nAnother factor is heavy metal poisoning. This would include lead, copper, mercury,\n\nSymptoms\n\nPrinciple signs are moodiness, solitary habits, stupor and excitement, delusions and\nhallucinations.\nHallucinations common, especially of hearing. Loss of emotion or, if shown, it is out of place. Actions\nare absent or inappropriate. There may be impulsive destructive acts and negativism.

Also\nsee osteomalacia under \"Rickets,\" which is sometimes misdiagnosed as osteoporosis.\n(Brittle Bones)\n\nCauses\n\nOsteoporosis is a reduction in the total mass of bone, so that the remaining bone is fragile or\n\"brittle.\" This weakening continues to increase. The bones actually become thinner. Bone formation is\nslowed; bone reabsorption increases, causing this loss of bone mass.\nAbout 25-30% of all white females in the U.S. reveal symptoms of this condition, especially after\nmenopause. Older men, above 50, also have it, but to a lesser degree than women. Osteoporosis is rare in\nblack men, but somewhat more common in black women.\nWhite women in America tend to lose 30-40% of their bone mass between 55-70.\nBut younger women should be watchful; research indicates that osteoporosis often begins early in life\nrather than just after menopause. (However, bone loss definitely accelerates after that time, due to a drop\nin estrogen levels.)\nPeople with larger and denser bones tend to have less trouble with osteoporosis later in life. They started\nout with more bony structure.\nA major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb\ncalcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of\ncertain hormones.\nStill other factors include late puberty, early menopause (natural or artificially induced), chronic liver or\nkidney disease, and the long-term use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and antiseizure medications.\nSmoking is an excellent way to damage your bones.\nCompression fractures in the vertebrae occur as bone loss advances. This causes a loss in height and\ncrowds the nerves, resulting in pain. Nerve damage is possible.

When it occurs in adults, it is\ncalled osteomalacia.\nIt can result either from not obtaining enough vitamin D in the food or from not getting enough sunlight.\nWhen sunlight strikes the skin, oils there are irradiated, reabsorbed into the blood stream and carried to\nthe liver, where it is stored and sent throughout the body to strengthen the bones. Without this vitamin,\nthe body cannot absorb calcium and phosphorous.\nThe bones cannot retain calcium, so they become soft. This results in deformities when the bones are\nrequired to support weight. Yet weight gain and growth will usually be normal.\nThe adult form, osteomalacia, generally occurs during pregnancy or breast-feeding. But it may also be\ncaused by a kidney disease or defect, calcium deficiency, a lack of vitamin D, or inability to utilize it. It\ncan also occur in those who do not obtain enough sunshine or whose bodies are so low in fat that they\ncannot produce the bile needed to absorb the vitamin D in the food.\nA deficiency of vitamin C can make the bones less able to retain bone-building minerals.\nOsteomalacia is often misdiagnosed as osteoporosis (which see).\n\nSymptoms\n\nEarly symptoms include nervousness, numbness in the extremities, leg cramps, and\npainful muscle spasms, as well as restlessness, irritability, and profuse sweating.\nLater indications include knock-knees, bowed legs, narrow rib cage, protruding breastbone, or scoliosis\n(abnormal curvature of the spine).

It should be as intense as can be tolerated. Hot castor oil packs are\nuseful (see \"Arthritis\" for information on how to prepare them).\n• Sometimes 10 minutes of hot, followed by 10 minutes of cold, applications seems to\nwork best.\n• Follow this with range of motion exercises at least once a day.\n• Do not become chilled.\n• Keep exercising, so joints will not lock up.\n• Do not push yourself too hard or too long during the day. If you are in pain, stop.\n• Sometimes rest and immobilization of the joint is needed for a time.\n• Vitamin E is beneficial in the treatment of bursitis. The need for protein and vitamins A\nand C increases during infection. Vitamin B is also helpful.\n12\n• DMSO from a health food store will help. Apply it to the skin of the affected area.\n\nCauses\n\nBursitis is the inflammation of the liquid-filled sac, called a bursa, found within joints,\nmuscles, tendons, and bones. These sacs normally help muscular movement occur.\nOverstimulation of the bursa causes the synovial membrane to produce excess fluid. This distends the\nbursa, which causes the discomfort.\nInjury to the area is a common cause, but chilling of the area during the day, especially at night can also\nlead to it. Bursitis can also be caused by chronic overuse, calcium deposits in the bursa wall, reactions to\ncertain foods or airborne allergies. In some instances, suddenly working tight muscles can do it; it is\ncalled a stretched muscle.\nAccording to where it is centered, bursitis has many names: housemaid's knee, tennis elbow, policeman's\nheel, frozen shoulder, or beat knee.\nThe lowly bunion (caused by friction in tight shoes) is also a form of bursitis. A bursa sac on the joint of\nthe big toe becomes inflamed.\nAthletes and older people are most likely to get bursitis, but it can happen to anyone at any age.\nWhat is the difference between bursitis and tendonitis (which see)? Both produce pain in the shoulder,\netc.\nBursitis generally exhibits a dull persistent ache that increases with movement. Tendonitis causes a\nsharp pain during movement, and is most likely to be caused to over-reaching for something. But it can\nalso be caused by calcium deposits pressing against a tendon. There is no swelling and fluid\naccumulation, as with bursitis. See \"Tendonitis\" for more on that problem.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSwelling, tenderness, and possible redness. A dull persistent ache that increases with\nmovement. Immense pain in the affected area, which frequently limits motion.\nIt most often occurs in shoulder joint and less often in the hip joint, in the elbows, or feet."},{"id":"disease-general-ankylosing-spondylitis","title":"Ankylosing Spondylitis","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Eliminate meat from the diet.

Do this for 20-30\nminutes. Prop up the leg, wrap it with an Ace bandage, and place the ice pack on it for 20-\n30 minutes.\n• An alternate method is a contrast bath of one minute, of ice, followed by a minute of\nheat. Do this for at least 12 minutes. This is especially good for pain in the inner leg\n(rather than the front where the shin splints occur).\n• Massage the area near the shin splint pain, but not on it. If you rub on it, the\ninflammation will worsen. Sit on the floor and lightly stroke on the sides several times.\nThen wrap your hands around the calf and, with your finger tips, stroke deeply around on\neach side of the shin from ankle to knee. Do the entire area, pressing as deeply as possible.\n• Try to correct flat feet or very high arches, if you can. They can also cause shin splints.\nPREVENTION—Try to avoid a lot of hard activity on unyielding surfaces, such as concrete. Even\ncarpet on concrete can cause problems. Grass or dirt is better than asphalt; asphalt is better than\nconcrete.\nWear good, comfortable shoes; and when they start wearing down, buy new ones.\nStretch your calves and Achilles tendon frequently. This helps prevent shin splints. Shortened calf\nmuscles throw more weight and stress forward to the shins.\nTo stretch your calves, place your hands on a wall, extend one leg behind the other, and press the back\nheel slowly to the floor. Do this 20 times, and repeat on the other leg.\nTo stretch your Achilles tendons, have both feet flat on the ground, about 6 inches apart. Bend your\nankles and knees forward while keeping the back straight. When you achieve tightness, hold it for 30\nseconds. Repeat 10 times.\n\nCauses\n\nThe experts are not clear as what shin splints are. They may be an irritation to the tendon\nwhich attaches the muscle to the bone. Or they may be a muscle irritation or the beginning of a stress\nfracture.\nActive people have shin splints. For example, 28% of long distance runners have them and 22% of\naerobic dancers.\nThey are caused by excessive walking, running, or jumping on a hard surface. But other factors include\npoor shoes, fallen arches, insufficient warm-up, poor posture, faulty walking and running techniques, or\noverstraining.\nSometimes the early stages of stress fractures are thought to be shin splints or vice verse. But there is a\ndifference: Stress fractures begin pinpoint pain, about the size of a dime or quarter, around or on a bony\narea. A shin splint is a generalized pain or aching discomfort up and down the whole shin. But, if the\nproblem is not stopped, shin splints can develop into stress fractures.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPain in the shins of one or both legs.

Too much sugar\nshocks the adrenal cortex, and the resulting physical reaction is to crave still more sugar.\n• Stop eating or using meat, nicotine, alcohol, chocolate, soft drinks, black tea, and\nsugared and fat foods. Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco produce wide swings in blood sugar\nlevels.\n• Read the labels at the grocery store, and avoid dextrose, dextrin, lactose, maltose,\nsucrose, fructose, modified food starch, corn syrup, corn sweetener, cornstarch, and\nnatural sweetener. Only use honey and molasses in small amounts. Also stay away from\nsorbitol, hexanol, mannitol, and glycol.\n• Too much salt also exhausts the adrenals and causes a loss of potassium, leading to\nlower blood sugar.\n• Eat natural foods, the ones you should have been eating to begin with. Whole grains, raw\nand simply cooked vegetables, some fresh fruit. But eat in moderation starchy foods, such\nas corn, noodles, pasta, white rice, hominy, and yams.\n• Eat a high-fiber diet and vegetables that are raw or steamed. These are good for you:\nbeans, lentils, brown rice, white potatoes, soy products, and fruits.\n• Useful fruits include apricots, apples, bananas, grapefruit, lemons, cantaloupes, and\npersimmons. For example, eat a raw apple instead of applesauce, for the apple has more\nfiber which will help keep blood sugar stabilized.\n• Licorice acts like cortin and helps the blood sugar. Bilberry and wild yam help control\ninsulin levels. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Spirulina tablets, taken between meals,\nhelp stabilize blood sugar.\n• During a blood sugar reaction, eat something that has both fiber and protein, such as rice\nor bran crackers with almond butter. Fiber alone (popcorn, rice, oat bran, crackers, ground\nflaxseed, and psyllium husks) has the ability to slow down a hypoglycemic reaction. A\nhalf hour before each meal, eat some of this high fiber, to stabilize blood sugar.\n• Once a month, go on a fresh vegetable juice fast for a day. Take enemas with some\nadded lemon juice at that time. If a reaction starts to occur, reach for the fiber, protein\npowder, or spirulina.\n• Avoid stressful situations. You may have a milk allergy, which often accompanies this\ndisease.\n(Low Blood Sugar)\n\nCauses\n\nThe problem is adrenal exhaustion. The cause is too much stress, worry, and an excess of\nundigested sugars, starches, proteins, and dairy products. The cortin hormone is depleted, so food cannot\nbe digested properly.\nPeople consume large quantities of sugars, caffeine, soft drinks, and alcohol. These all contain simple\nsugars, and insufficient amounts of complex carbohydrates. Add to this: high stress levels, and the two\nadrenal glands become exhausted.\nHypoglycemia can be inherited, but more often it is brought on by an inadequate diet (and is then called\nfunctional hypoglycemia). However, there are several other physical problems which can weaken\nadrenal function and help bring on hypoglycemia. These include weaknesses in the thyroid, liver,\nkidneys, pituitary, and pancreas. Immune deficiency and candidiasis can also lead to it. Other causes\ninclude smoking and large amounts of caffeine.\nHypoglycemia is sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as asthma, allergies, fatigue syndrome, stomach,\nintestinal, weight problems, or mental or nervous disorders.\nHalf the people, over 50, who have hypoglycemia, are hypothyroid.\n\nSymptoms\n\nConfusion, depression, nervousness, anxiety, antisocial behavior, emotional instability,\nexhaustion, headaches, impatience, inability to cope, fears, craving for sugar, faintness, dizziness.\nSymptoms especially occur a few hours after eating sweets or fats.

Yet, surprisingly enough, the shrunken glands can still\noverproduce and cause Cushing's Disease or underproduce and cause Addison's.\nThere is a way you can pinpoint whether or not your adrenals are functioning normally:\nThe systolic is the first number in a blood pressure reading, and the diastolic is the second. For example,\n120/80. The systolic should be 10 points higher when you are standing than when you are lying down.\nLie down and rest for 5 minutes, and then have someone take your blood pressure. Then stand up and\nhave it immediately taken again. The blood pressure will probably be somewhat higher.\nBut if it is lower when standing than when laying flat, the adrenals are not working properly. The lower\nit is, the worse the condition of the adrenals.\nYou will want to contact a medical professional. Addison's is a chronic condition which needs to be\ncontinually worked with. You may moderate the problem, but it is never fully eliminated.\n\nSymptoms\n\nDizziness, fainting, nausea, loss of appetite, moodiness, decrease in body hair, inability\nto cope with stress.

Avoid tobacco, alcohol, etc.\n—Also see \"Birth Defects\" for more information on cystic fibrosis.\n\nCauses\n\nIn 1938, this physical problem was named \"cystic fibrosis\" because it was mistakenly\nthought that abnormal changes in the pancreas were true cysts (tiny pockets of fluid lined with normal\ntissue). But it was later discovered that those spots were just part of the shrinking process of the\npancreas, as the disease worsened.\nThere are three views of the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF):\n1 - CF is an inherited disease, which the sufferer must learn to live with.\n2 - CF is caused by inadequate absorption of selenium, zinc, essential fatty acids, and other minerals\n(including trace minerals) as a result of subclinical celiac disease. (Celiac disease is the inability to\ndigest wheat and some other foods.)\n3 - Dr. Joel Wallach, a veterinarian, who in 1978 was the first to diagnose CF in a laboratory animal, by\nnoting characteristic CF changes in the pancreas and liver of baby monkeys, says he was fired when it\nwas discovered that he could reproduce those CF changes in the body by giving or withholding the\nelement, selenium. He had shown that CF was a nutritional problem which could be solved if caught\nearly enough. (See Let's Play Doctor, J.D. Wallach, D.V.M., N.D., pp. 109-110. See order sheet.)\n\"The prevention of CF has been accomplished in pet, farm and laboratory animals by the veterinary\nprofession by assuring adequate levels of selenium and essential fatty acid nutrition to the pregnant and\nnursing mother. This is not as easy as it sounds because of malabsorption problems (i.e., celiac disease\nand Crohn's disease) in a percentage of women. All things being normal, a supplementation of 200 mcg\nselenium per day and 5 gm of flaxseed oil, three times a day [to the pregnant and nursing mother], would\nbe adequate to prevent CF.\n\"Treatment of CF is very basic: treat the infant as early as possible with selenium IM [given\nintramuscularly] at 10-25 mcg per day.\"—Op cit., p. 109.\nHe adds that it is vital that it be determined if the infant is allergic to wheat, cow's milk or soy milk, so\nas to avoid what he is allergic to.\nWe might conclude that all three theories are correct; in that, if you give the mother and infant proper\nsupplementation, the disease can be eliminated at the beginning of the child's life.\nBut if this is not done, he will thereafter not be able to absorb nutrients properly, will exhibit the\nsymptoms of CF, and will have to cope with the problem the rest of his life.\nHowever, Wallach says that, even later, the person can lead a more normal life if he regularly receives\nessential fatty acids, intravenously, and selenium, intramuscularly.\n\"The lungs of CF patients are normal at birth and only develop bronchiectasis after chronic essential\nfatty acid and copper deficiencies have taken their toll.\"—Ibid.\n\"CF . . is preventable, 100% curable in the early stages, and can be far better managed in chronic cases\nthan it is currently managed by `orthodox' medicine.\"—Op. cit., p. 108.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe symptoms are first seen in very small children. Large amounts of thick mucous\ndevelops in the lungs, blocking lung passages and causing difficult breathing, chronic coughing and\nwheezing, and lung infections.\nThere are digestive problems, inadequate absorption of fats, after-meal stomach pain, and thinness.

But how do you obtain it? Long use of\nthyroid medication can weaken the bones or result in breast cancer.\n• Among the seaweeds, Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp are the best balanced\nsources of trace minerals. Most other seaweed products also contain iodine, but they are\nnot always as balanced in providing a wide spectrum of other trace minerals. California\nkelp is not as good.\n• Here is an address for Nova Scotia dulse: Harry Greene, North Head, Grand Manan, N.\nB. [New Brunswick], Canada. My last boxful was $12 for 12 ounces. I let it dry, then\nwhiz the leaves, put them in jars, and sprinkle it on my food.\n• Some nature therapists recommend coating the bottom of your feet with iodine, in order\nto increase iodine absorption by your body. Others do not recommend it. You really have\nno certainty as to what substances and quantities you are taking into your body.\n• Another source of iodine is Lugol's solution. This, of course, should be taken in\nextremely small doses. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain. Pharmacies have it, but will\nnot dispense it without a prescription.\n• Of course, there is also iodized salt. The problem here is that aluminum is in store-\nbought salt (so it will not cake), and that can lead to Alzheimer's disease (which see).\n• Some turn to \"sea salt,\" but generally this is nothing more than regular salt, extracted\nfrom the ocean rather than from salt mines. It is just regular salt!\n• Some use rock salt (from salt mines), and grind it up. But this lacks the iodine.\n• There is a firm in France which produces salt from the ocean which does have all the\nnatural trace minerals, including iodine: The U.S. address is Grain & Salt Society, P.O.\nBox DD, Magalia, CA 95954 / 916-872-5800. Of the three products (Light Grey, Fine\nGround, and Flower of the Ocean), the Fine Ground seems to strike a balance between\nfine grain and low price. The salt is slightly moist, but this is natural. Dry, free-flowing,\nsalt has always been treated with chemicals.\n• I recommend that you use both Nova Scotia dulse and this French sea salt at every meal.\n• For some, thyroid problems can be corrected, but for others it is something to live with,\nfor a lifetime, while doing that which may lessen the problem. In addition to taking added\niodine, eat a nutritious diet. The experts say to only eat in moderation the cabbage family\n(broccoli, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, mustard greens), for they tend to suppress the\nthyroid function. The same is said to hold true for peaches and pears.\n• Chlorine, fluoride, and iodine are chemically related, and block entrance of iodine into\nthe thyroid. So avoid chlorinated water, fluoridated water, and toothpaste.\n• A thyroid deficiency can result from lack of sunshine and free fats (margarine, butter,\nmayonnaise, fried foods, cooking fats, salad oils, and peanut butter).\n• Functions of the thyroid will be increased by more exercise, for it stimulates TSH\nproduction by the pituitary. T3 increases slowly in the blood during, and after, vigorous\nexercise.\n• Mother's milk is a good treatment for hypothyroid babies, and it helps protect normal\nbabies from developing the problem until weaning.\n• Vitamin A is necessary for iodine to be properly absorbed; the B vitamins work together,\nto nourish the thyroid; B helps the thyroid use its iodine effectively in hormone\n6\nproduction; B helps the thyroid work properly.\n12\n• To stimulate the thyroid: Eat one serving each of oats and bananas daily, take a cool\nshower each morning and night, and work 3-5 hours out-of-doors every day.\n• Avoid electric blankets if you can.\n• Use a salt-free, oil-free, sugar-free diet until the thyroid is under control. But, on the long\nterm, you need a little salt and oil.\n• In cretins, who are born hypothyroid, try taking them off the thyroid medication after\nthree years of supplementation. Maybe their thyroid will start functioning on its own.\n• A nature healer in Central America recommends the following procedures:\n• To go off thyroid supplementation: Go on a fasting, cleansing program of fruit and\nvegetable juices, followed by a building program of eating simple nourishing foods\n(especially raw food). Do this for 2-4 weeks. Get back and neck spinal adjustments, and\ntake one kelp tablet daily. He says this always works.\nGOITER—He also recommends this:\nTo eliminate goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland): Follow the above program; and then, after the 2-4\nweeks, do one or more of the following four neck applications: (1) Put an Epsom salt compress on the\nneck every night, and leave it on all night for 10 nights. (2) Use a compress of white oak bark tea over\nthe goiter for better results. (3) Put two hot fomentations around the neck, for 4 minutes each and one\ncold compress for 4 minutes. Continue alternating this for an hour. Then spend 5-10 minutes doing\nexercises with the neck in various positions. (4) Put a poultice of ground-up almonds completely around\nthe neck and leave it on all night, for 3-10 nights. This is especially good for harder, more fibrous,\ngoiters.\nNitrates are goitrogenic; that is, they stimulate goiter formation. Nitrates can be found in hot dogs,\nsausages, luncheon meats, and variously prepared meat products. Nitrates are also found in well water,\nfrom fertilizer runoff.\nInterestingly enough, many people with Parkinson's disease (which see) tend to have hypothyroidism.\n(Underactive Thyroid; Goiter)\n\nCauses\n\nThe thyroid gland is the body's thermostat. It tells the rest of the body when to produce more\nheat or less. Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck),\nand affects several body functions, including the general rate of metabolism. The pituitary, located in the\ncenter of the skull, sends out TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), to tell the thyroid to speed up or slow\ndown. When a weak thyroid does not respond, TSH levels remain high—and you have hypothyroidism.\nThe hormone, thyroxine, is almost pure iodine.\nFirst thing in the morning, place a thermometer under your arm for 15 minutes while keeping still. A\ntemperature of 97.6o F. or lower may indicate an underactive thyroid. Write down the result for five\ndays. (Others say that if the test is consistently below 98, you are low thyroid.)\nA low thyroid condition generally does not produce goiter (which see). If you had goiter, your thyroid\ngland would enlarge.\nIt is thought that Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. This occurs\nwhen the body becomes allergic to its own thyroxine! It is not clear why this happens.\nIn addition, the immune system can produce antibodies that invade and attack the thyroid, disrupting\nhormone production. This destruction of the thyroid, resulting in hypothyroidism, is called myxedema. It\nis actually a disease of the immune system. It is believed that an excess of chemicals, poisonous fumes,\nmedicinal drugs, tobacco smoke, impure living, etc., disrupts the immune system and starts it on such\nrampages.\nGet away from the chemicals by moving to the country, live a clean life, eat right, use a distiller to make\nyour own water, work out-of-doors part of the time, have peace with God, and you will feel better every\nday.\nMedical treatment includes the taking of thyroxine from animals, or synthroid. This is generally 3-9\ngrains each morning. An excess will cause increase in heart rate and shaking of the extended arm.\nThe active ingredient in synthroid and other synthetic thyroid medications, is levothyroxine. It can cause\na loss of as much as 13 percent of bone mass. An estimated 19 million people in the U.S. take this drug\nfor thyroid problems or thyroid cancer.\nThyroid supplementation can cause cardiac arrest in those whose hearts are not strong enough for the\nincreased activity the thyroid dosage places upon it.\nThyroid medication can have a similar effect on the adrenals. They may be working poorly, as a result of\nyears of low thyroxine. The medication can cause adrenal insufficiency. Diabetes can be made worse by\nthe thyroid pill. Anticoagulants can be upset.\nIn newborn infants, synostosis can occur if they are given thyroid. The skull bones close prematurely\nand the brain does not develop properly.\nThyroid supplementation also increases the need for insulin and, in some, for antidepressants as they\nbecome extremely agitated.\nThyroid medication can produce arrhythmia, angina, and tachycardia, or hair loss.\nAfter menopause, a smaller dose of thyroid medication is often needed by women.\nThe human body needs less thyroid as it gets older, so older folk should try reducing their dose of\nsynthroid. To do this, try reducing the amount you take by one dose a week (example: 5 doses a week,\nthen 4 doses the next week, etc.). When you encounter problems, stay with that amount for 4 weeks to\nsee if the thyroid will adjust itself to this new amount. After a month, try reducing the dosage again, but\nstaying one month at each reduced level.\n\nSymptoms\n\nFatigue and inability to tolerate cold are the most common symptoms.\nOthers include: loss of appetite, a slow heart rate, muscle weakness and possible cramps, dry and scaly\nskin, recurrent infections, water retention (edema) and overweight, brittle nails, constipation, depression,\ndifficulty in concentrating, a yellow-orange coloration of the skin (especially on the palms of the hands).\nIn women, there might be painful menstruation, a milky breast discharge, and fertility problems."},{"id":"disease-general-hyperthyroidism","title":"Hyperthyroidism","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• The eating of kelp helps every type of thyroid problem, including hyperthyroidism. Kelp\nis a rich source of iodine and thyroxine.

Hyperthyroidism is the opposite: The thyroid is overactive; metabolism is too fast,\nand that brings its own problems. The thyroid gland is producing too much thyroxine.\nSometimes called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is not a simple problem to deal with. Graves' disease\nis the most common form of it, which 2.5 million Americans have.\nA detailed discussion of the thyroid is found in our article on Hypothyroidism (which see), which is far\nmore common. Both affect women more often than men. When the thyroid does not work properly, a\nvariety of different physical problems can develop.\nIn fact, the word, \"hypochondriac,\" was coined many years ago, to describe these strange people who\nhave all kinds of things wrong with them, when they do not seem to have anything wrong with them.\nSurely, it must all be in their heads! Well, it was in their throats. We now know those people had under\nor overactive thyroids.\nInfection of the thyroid or certain prescription drugs can temporarily produce hyperthyroidism.\n\nSymptoms\n\nFatigue; insomnia; intolerance; irritability; increased perspiration; constantly feeling\nhot; frequent bowel movements; hair and weight loss; nails separate from nail bed; change in skin\nthickness; hand tremors; intolerance of heat; rapid heartbeat; goiter; and, sometimes, protruding\neyeballs.

The diet should be at least 50% raw food.\n• Avoid animal products and dairy products.\n• Do not use alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, sugar, and hot soups and drinks. They make\nthe emotional swings worse and the blood more acidic. This causes the bones to release\nextra calcium, to balance blood pH and weaken the bones if extra calcium is not taken.\n• Substitute garlic and onion powder for salt. Consuming salt increases urinary excretion\nof calcium.\n• Drink 2 quarts of water each day, to help prevent drying of skin and mucous membranes.\n• After menopause begins, you will not have as much calcium in your body, due to the\nlessened estrogen; it is important that you henceforth supplement with calcium. Of the\n250,000 hip fractures that occur in the U.S. every year, 80% are due to osteoporosis.\n• Avoid mental and emotional stress and worry. Be happy with the blessings you have,\nand thank God for them.\n• Get plenty of outdoor exercise and sufficient rest. Lay down and rest a little before lunch\nand supper. A lack of exercise weakens bone density.\n• Especially important are vitamins E, C, A, and B complex, including PABA and\npantothenic acid.\n• Hypothyroidism is common during menopause, and is responsible for a number of the\nsymptoms. Be sure and take additional amounts of Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp.\n• Helpful herbs include lady's mangle, motherwort, and St. John's wort.\n—Also see \"Menstrual Disorders\" for related information.\n\nCauses\n\nMenopause is the cessation of ovarian function, the stopping of the menstrual cycle, and the\nend of reproductive years. This is caused by glandular changes, and is a natural event in a woman's life;\nthis usually occurs between 42 and 55. The average age is about 50, and the transition is generally up to\n5 years.\nThere tends to be a hormone starvation at that time, since menopause usually results from a decreased\nproduction of the female sex hormones.\nThe lessened supply of estrogen increases the possibility of cardiovascular disease, vaginal atrophy, and\nosteoporosis.\nIt is popular to take estrogen supplements, to prevent or postpone menopausal symptoms. But keep in\nmind that there is an increased risk of cancer when this is done.\nIf estrogen (hormone replacement) therapy is begun, take vitamin E several hours earlier or later, not at\nthe same time.\nIn addition, generous amounts of vitamins B , C, folic acid, pantothenic acid, PABA, and B will make\n6 12\nthe estrogen therapy more effective.\nOral estrogens should not be accompanied by progesterone because they increase the cancer induction\nrisk.\nKeep in mind that synthetic, not natural, estrogens are given in hormone replacement therapy. These\ntend to accumulate in the body, and also can cause metabolic changes in the liver. This can lead to high\nblood pressure, fluid retention, and blood clots. But natural estrogens are available; one is equine\nestrogen, and is extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. But it is very powerful, and may also cause\nchanges in the liver. Do not use it if you are obese, smoke, or have high blood pressure, high cholesterol,\nor varicose veins.\nThe safest natural estrogens are estropipate (Ogen) and estradiol (Estrace, Emcyt, and Estraderm); these\nare all metabolized more easily by your body. Be sure and use the smallest possible dose, and take it\nonly every other day.\nIt is coming to be recognized that it is often more important to replace the lessened progesterone than the\nlessened estrogen. Natural progesterone creams (from the herb, wild yam) provide a simplified way to\ndo this. Many, many, have been helped by doing this!\nWhen the menopause proceeds normally, the adrenals and liver increase their output of female hormones\nand make up the difference from the lost ovarian function.\nProper diet, nutritional supplements, exercise, and adequate rest can minimize the effects of menopause.\n\nSymptoms\n\nHot flashes, insomnia, disturbances in calcium metabolism, irritability, mental\ninstability, dizziness, backaches, headaches, bladder problems, dryness and aging of the skin, shortness\nof breath, and heart palpitations. Some have almost no symptoms at all."},{"id":"disease-general-pelvic-inflammatory-disease","title":"Pelvic Inflammatory Disease","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Go on a fruit and vegetable juice fast for a time.\n• When solid food is started, eat nourishing food, free of sugar and oil.

There are four types:\n1 - Yeast vaginitis, also called monilial, or thrush. The yeast infection causing it is candida albicans. It is\nmore common in pregnant women, diabetics, and those on antibiotics, oral contraceptives, or long-term\nsteroid therapy. Changes in the vaginal pH (caused by tap water, tub baths, certain additives to bath\nwater, and some commercial douches) permit the yeast to grow in the vagina. The discharge is moderate\nin amount, but thick yellowish or white and curd-like. It may cause severe itching of the external\ngenitalia (see \"Candida\").\n2 - Trichomonas, caused by trichomonas vaginalis. This is a protozoan which likes an alkaline\nenvironment. It may be sexually transmitted (so both should be treated at the same time). In the man,\nthere are no symptoms; in the woman, there is a greenish white or heavy yellow, frothy, discharge which\nmay have a slight odor. The discharge causes itching, burning, and reddening of the skin. If it spreads to\nthe urethra, there may be frequent burning urination. Flagyl, which is a medication for this, is known to\ncause cancer in animals.\n3 - Non-specific vaginitis is caused by organisms other than yeast or trichomonas, and occurs when\nresistance is low and the normal vaginal flora changes.\n4 - Atrophic vaginitis occurs in post-menopausal women and those whose ovaries have been surgically\nremoved. Adhesions form and there is a high susceptibility to infection. Symptoms include itching or\nburning, painful intercourse, and a thin watery discharge, sometimes tinged with blood.\nVaginitis may have one or more of the following causes: bacterial or fungal infection, intestinal worms,\nvitamin B deficiency, congestion of the pelvic organs, gonococci, chemical irritation (strong douches),\nmechanical irritation (tampons), drug medications, and deodorant sprays.\nOther contributing factors include tight and nonporous clothing, diabetes, and the use of antibiotics.\nThe birth control pill causes a B deficiency and changes the vaginal pH.\n6\nPregnancy increases the vaginal pH, and also its glycogen content. This is favorable to yeast infection.\nBut it generally leaves\nTight-fitting synthetic underwear provides poor ventilation and a warm, moist, environment for yeast\ninfection to occur.\nExcess sugar and refined carbohydrates help feed yeast infection.\nNormally, the pH of the vagina is acid; anything that alkalinizes it contributes to vaginitis. Causes\ninclude diabetes, menstrual period, pregnancy, and the time just after a miscarriage or abortion.\nThe most common aftereffect of antibiotic therapy in women is a vaginal yeast infection.\nFrequent douching upsets vaginal pH and flora.\nExcessive sex or intercourse, without proper lubrication, irritates vaginal walls.\nAbout 5% of women given tetracycline for acne develop vaginitis.\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) produce a favorable environment for yeast infection, since they reduce\nnormal vaginal secretions.\nFour primary factors are antibiotics, oral contraceptives, diabetes, and pregnancy.\n\nSymptoms\n\nVaginal pain or tenderness, itching, increased vaginal discharge, burning sensation,\npainful intercourse, and urination."},{"id":"disease-general-leukorrhea","title":"Leukorrhea","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• The infective cause should be determined, and then treated.

This will reduce the amount of estrogen deprivation, especially if you\nstill have your ovaries.\n• If you do use hormonal replacement, take the lowest dosage possible. Ask for a\ncombined hormone containing both estrogen and progesterone. That will help reduce the\nrisk of cancer. Progesterone, not estrogen, is the hormone most needed in replacement\ntherapy.\n\nCauses\n\nA hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, and is done to remove fibroids (30%\nof the time), endometriosis (20%), or uterine prolapse (18%).\nThere are three types of hysterectomies, each more complete than the preceding one:\n1 - Partial hysterectomy: The uterus is removed, but the cervix and other female reproductive organs\nremain.\n2 - Total hysterectomy: Both the uterus and cervix are removed.\n3 - Panhysterectomy: The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are removed.\nThere are problems which led to the decision to have a hysterectomy. These may include urinary tract\nproblems, lengthy and heavy periods, a heavy and bloated feeling, abdominal swelling due to fibroids,\ninfertility resulting from fibroids or endometriosis, or reactions to drugs given for endometriosis.\nBut the problems resulting from a hysterectomy are, if anything, more significant:\nThe hormones are suddenly stopped. This sends shock waves throughout the entire system.\nLack of those hormones can result in immense bone mass loss, osteoporosis, and greater likelihood of\nheart disease, depression, urinary tract problems, dizziness, insomnia, headaches, and general fatigue.\nEven those women who do not have their ovaries cut out still experience a drastic lessening of estrogen\noutput. In addition, menopause begins years earlier for half the women who are spared their ovaries.\nDepression may also occur, and reduced sexual desire frequently does. There is a 50% chance of a minor\npost-operative complication, such as fever, bleeding, or wound healing.

Such defects include cleft palates, cleft lips, heart defects, limb defects, spina\nbifida, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart defects, brain defect, fetal hernia.\nAll of the above diseases have been eliminated from valuable livestock by the veterinary profession.\nThey have done this by giving the animals excellent nutrition.\nIt is well-known that bearing a child after the age of 40 can cause problems. But teenagers have a greater\npercentage of children with birth defects than do women over 40, because of their general poor eating\nhabits and lack of vitamin/mineral supplementation. Many young people today live on junk food and\nhave damaged offspring as a result.\nAs an example, let us consider cystic fibrosis; it is a type of adrenal damage). It is classified as the \"most\ncommon genetic defect\"; yet, in reality, cystic fibrosis is a selenium and fatty acid deficiency in the fetus\nand/or newborn breast-fed infant. If the mother has celiac disease, this can impede her absorption of\nessential nutrients, especially selenium, even more.\nIn 1958, Dr. Kaus Schwartz reported in the NIH publication, Federal Proceedings, that selenium was an\nessential nutrient. The deficiency symptoms he reported all fit cystic fibrosis. But no one paid attention.\nIn 1972, Cornell University found that chicks hatched from selenium deficient hens developed all the\nclassical symptoms of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. But they too did not connect the finding to\nselenium.\nBut they also discovered that, if selenium was given to the chicks within 30 days after hatching, they\nwere totally cured within 21 days.\nIn 1978, J.D. Wallach, a veterinarian researcher, identified this problem in animals and birds as being\n\"cystic fibrosis.\" But, when other researchers agreed with his findings, Wallach was fired within 24\nhours from his government research laboratory.\nSince that date, Wallach has treated over 450 CF patients with excellent results. He has cured three-\nmonth-old infants of the disorder. Wallach later did joint research with the Chinese Government in their\nhospitals, and helped thousands of their people.\nYet, in America, the people are told CF is a \"genetic defect\" and nothing can be done, except expensive\nand time-consuming rehabilitation programs.\nDr. Arthur F.

There is abdominal pain, distension, insomnia,\nextreme fretfulness, or hysteria. The child cries out, pulls the knees up to the stomach, and has a\ndistended stomach.\nCAUSES AND TREATMENT—\n• Abnormal amounts of gas are passing upward or downward, and this is causing pain.\n• You can immediately give the infant warm catnip tea in a bottle. A catnip tea enema will\nalso help. Crying spells occur at regular intervals; so, if a very warm bath is given an hour\nbefore an expected attack, it may be prevented. Have catnip tea on hand to use in an\nemergency.\n• In addition, a hot footbath or hot fomentation over the abdomen will relieve the baby.\n• If the baby is totally breast-fed, the cause is in the mother's diet. Any food the mother\nmay eat may, through her milk, causes the baby to suffer infant colic; onions, cabbage,\ngarlic, wheat, yeast, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are common offenders. Another major\ncause is fried food, junk food, refined food, and all types of confused food combinations.\nBoth the mother and the child need a good diet.\n• Colic in a formula-fed infant points to the food given to the child. It may be the milk,\nwheat, soy, or sugar in the formula. If possible, substitute vitamin-enriched goat's milk.\nAlso try to have the mother begin breast-feeding the baby. Even if she did not begin doing\nit after delivery, she can, with some effort, get the flow started later. This is done by\nfrequent attempts to feed the baby over several months.\n• If the infant is bottle-fed, for added nourishment at this time you might pour boiling\nwater over wheat flakes, to dissolve them; put them through a sieve; and add soybean\nmilk, to bring it to a desired consistency. Potassium broth and oatmeal gruel are also\nhelpful.\n• If colic develops after weaning has begun, the new food is the problem. The infant must\nbe given proper foods and only one new food should be added at a time, so the infant can\nbe carefully monitored for colic, rashes, or other reactions.\n• Wheat and dairy products are especially suspect. When in doubt, eliminate them first.\nWheat and other grains are often introduced far too early. But this can cause the child to\nlater develop celiac disease, which will affect him throughout life (see \"Celiac Disease\").\nThe infant does not have the digestive enzymes to handle grains until 5-6 months. Let\ngrains be one of the last foods introduced, and do not give yeast bread until after a year\nold.\n• Give fresh, boiled, goat's milk; it is far less of a problem.\n• Keep diet diaries and do pulse testing, to ascertain offending foods (see \"Pulse Test\").\n• It may help to give pancreatic enzymes (75-200 mg three times a day) before meals\n(enzymes may be constipating), flaxseed oil (1-2 drops) after each meal, and vitamin B\n6\n(10 mg twice a day).\n—Also see \"Colic in Children.\""},{"id":"disease-general-teething","title":"Teething","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Massage the baby's gums, beginning before the teeth appear.

One research team found that the 3-4 hour feedings, recommended by\nmany hospitals, is incorrect; the feedings should be every 2 hours, in order to reduce\nbilirubin levels.\n• Activated charcoal is very helpful in lowering bilirubin levels. Stir 2-3 teaspoons\npowdered charcoal into a little water, and give with a nipple. Beginning at 4 hours of age,\ngive it every two hours, for 120 hours in normal newborns, 168 hours in premature infants\nor until bilirubin levels fall.\n• Exposure to sunlight helps reduce bilirubin levels. It can fall on the infant a little through\nthe window or he can be taken outside. Do not let direct sunlight enter his eyes, but let it\nfall on as much bare skin as possible. Of course, be careful and do not sunburn him.\n\nCauses\n\nJaundice is probably the most common disorder in newborn babies. Old blood is broken\ndown, by the liver, into bilirubin, a yellowish pigment. But when too much is made, the excess is\ndumped into the bloodstream and is deposited in tissues for temporary storage. About a fifth of infants\nhave this, to one extent or another.\n\"Breast milk jaundice\" occurs in about 3% of infants. Peak levels of bilirubin do not occur until the tenth\nor fifteenth day, and may not return to normal for 12 weeks. But do not stop breast-feeding during this\ntime.\nIf the baby has prolonged jaundice, have a thyroid check done; he might have a tendency toward\nhypothyroidism (which see).\nCertain drugs given to the mother during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breast-feeding can lead to\nneonatal jaundice. This includes sulfonamides, hydrocortisone, Valium, Orinase, Gentamicin, thiazide\ndiuretics, and oral contraceptives.\n\nSymptoms\n\nA yellowing of the skin is seen in the infant, appearing first in the upper body and\nprogressing downward toward the toes.

Rub the area with borax and with\ncastor oil.\n• A 3-day citrus fast is very helpful, cleansing the bowels daily. Follow this with a\nnutritious diet.\n• Eat plenty of garlic. Put raw garlic over the ringworm and cover. You can also use black\nwalnut extract. Wash the area with garlic juice or wormwood.\n• Place freshly cut garlic 3 times a day on the area. This is a very good remedy. Blend the\ngarlic with a little water and apply as a soak, compress, or poultice. But this remedy is too\npowerful to apply to raw flesh between the toes; it can burn lower layers of skin.\n• Take 2 chaparral or wormwood capsules daily.\n• The scalp can be shampooed with tar soap and borax. Moisten the area every morning\nand evening with goldenseal (1 teaspoon) and myrrh (½ teaspoon), which has been\nsteeped in a pint of boiling water.\n• An herb tea can also be taken internally: goldenseal or plantain, twice a day.\n• Make a salve from equal parts of burdock root, chaparral, wormwood, and chickweed;\napply to the area. Some of it can also be made into a tea to drink in order to fight the\nfungus internally.\n• Keep the skin clean and dry. Ringworm likes damp skin. Take frequent baths, but dry\nthoroughly each time. Rub briskly with a towel, to remove the outer dead layers of skin\nthat the ringworm initially attacks.\n• Do not scratch. Keep fingernails cut short, to lessen accidental scratching and spreading\nof the infection.\n• To remove crusts, soak the area in a saline solution. An alternate method is to apply\nmoist cloths for 10-15 minutes, 3 times a day.\n• To treat nails: Pare and scrape the infected area, and try to remove as much of the loose\nmaterial beneath the nails.

It is\nhighly contagious, and often found on school-children. It frequently induces baldness, which may\nbecome permanent if hair shafts are destroyed by the fungus.\nRingworm of the trunk - This includes “jockey itch,” and is spread by contact with people or their\nclothing. Dogs and cats can also spread it.\nRingworm of the nails - This consists of a fungus growing under the nails. It produces thickened,\nmisshapen, brittle, discolored, chalky, pitted, or grooved nails. The nails can either be on the hands or\nthe feet. This type of ringworm is quite difficult to eliminate.\nRingworm of the feet - This is also known as athlete's foot (see \"Athlete's Foot\").\n\nSymptoms\n\nSmall, flat, red, slightly elevated ring or oval-shaped sores, which may be crusted, dry,\nscaly, or moist. The centers of the sores heal as the sores spread outward. The result is an infected ring.\nItching, burning, or pain may be present. The lesions appear to be circular.

It is communicable 1-2 days before the rash develops, until all the blister-like lesions have\ncrusted (averaging 5-6 days).\nChickenpox mainly occurs between 2 and 8 years of age, and is much more severe if not contracted until\none is an adult. If a pregnant mother has it in the first four months of pregnancy, birth defects are\npossible in the infant. Once you have had it, you generally have lifetime immunity. This is why\nchickenpox vaccines are dangerous. It is better to get the disease as a child when it is relatively harmless\nthan to wait till adulthood to contract it.\nOddly enough, the same virus that causes chickenpox in children (varicella zoster) is the one which\ncauses shingles (which see) in adults.\nChickenpox is transmitted by contact and by airborne droplets.

The secondary\nstage is difficult to detect and so is often misdiagnosed as arthritis. The gonorrhea is entering the bones,\njoints, tendons, and other tissues, causing mild fever, aches, inflamed joints, and sometimes skin lesions.\nIn men, the outcome can be sterility.\nAs long as 10 years later, the urethra may narrow or stricture, making urination difficult and at times\nimpossible. This produces serious inflammation of the bladder. This occurs more often in men than in\nwomen.\nWomen, who unknowingly contract gonorrhea from their husbands, generally do not know they have the\ndisease until it is far advanced. The infection can travel up the uterus, into the Fallopian tubes, and out\ninto the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis and possibly death. If that does not occur, then the tubes\nmay eventually seal off due to the infection, causing sterility and pus pockets which cause pain and\ninfection.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn women, no symptoms may ever appear. When they do, it may include vaginal\ndischarge, frequent and painful urination, abnormal menstrual bleeding, acute inflammation in the pelvic\narea, and rectal itching. Symptoms generally appear 7-14 days after sexual contact. In men, symptoms\nare generally present, including difficult and painful urination, a yellow discharge of pus, and mucous\nfrom the penis.

But a thorough\ncleansing and building program, such as is explained under \"Cancer,\" is needed.\n\nCauses\n\nSyphilis is caused by the germ, treponema pallidum, which is corkscrew in shape and much\nlarger than most bacteria. Drying quickly kills the germs, so they must remain wet; they generally enter\nthe body through a living source—another person (acquired syphilis) or through the placenta to the\nunborn child (congenital syphilis). But, in some instances, it has been transmitted to the dentist during\ndental work.\n\nSymptoms\n\nA chancre appears on the skin, either on the mouth, in the mouth, or on the genitals. It\nis also called a hard chancre or Hunterian sore. This is a red, painless, raised ulcer with hard, well-\ndefined edges, and appears 10 days to 3 weeks after exposure, and lasts from a few days to several\nweeks.

It is a powerful antiseptic. Do not get it near your eyes.\n• Drink only distilled water and get plenty of rest.\n(Herpes Type II)\n\nCauses\n\nOf the 90 varieties of animal herpes, only four affect humans. Herpes is a virus that causes\nrecurrent blisters and ulcers (cold sores, also called fever blisters on the lips [Type I] and on the genitals\n[Type II]). (See \"Cold Sores\" for information on Type I.) A third type is herpes zoster, which causes\nchicken pox and, as a secondary infection, shingles. (See \"Chicken pox\" and \"Shingles.\") Type II can\nproduce blisters either on the genitals or on, or around, the mouth.\nWe will here deal only with Type II, which is also called herpes genitalis, venereal herpes, and genital\nherpes. It is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. One-sixth of all\nAmericans (about 30 million) have the disease, although about half never develop serious symptoms. A\nhalf million new cases are reported yearly, and 80% are 20 to 39 years of age. The first attack generally\noccurs about 4-8 days after initial exposure to a sexual partner. Each occurrence is quite painful and lasts\nup to three weeks; but, once a person is infected, the disease can be transmitted at any time. Symptoms\nreoccur from every few weeks to once a year or less. Scarring does not usually occur, but can. Outbreaks\nrarely occur after the age of 50.\nHerpes is a virus which enters the body thorough the skin and travels into nerve groups at the base of the\nspine. It remains with you the rest of your lifetime. But it can be dormant for years and then appear\nagain when the immune system is lowered by poor diet, stress, illness, too much sunlight, or harmful\nchemicals.\nType II reoccurs when sexual intercourse takes place, as a result of irritation to the skin. It is not a newly\ninvaded infection, but one which was received from a sexual partner at an earlier time.\nThis viral infection can range from a symptomless infection in the nerves to a major inflammation of the\nliver, accompanied by fever. In women, it can lead to cervical cancer.\nThere seems to be a link between having Type II and later developing atherosclerosis.\nAs a baby passes through an infected birth canal, it can get Type II and possibly have brain damage,\nblindness, or death as a result. If an attack occurs late in the pregnancy, the baby should be delivered by\ncesarean section. If no lesions are present, the baby is far less likely to become infected as it passes\nthrough the birth canal.\n\nSymptoms\n\nRecurrent fluid-filled blisters on the genitals that rupture, leaving red, inflamed, painful\nlesions. These are preceded by a slightly irritating tingling. When the lesion appears, it is accompanied\nby a sharp pain."},{"id":"disease-general-aids","title":"Aids","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• There are definite indications that those who test positive for HIV, yet who take good\ncare of their immune systems, are less likely to develop full-blown AIDS.

But,\ninstead, it is an exploding epidemic.\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) invades special immune cells in the body, which are called T\nlymphocytes, and then slowly multiplies over a long period of time. As it does so, the body's immune\nsystem gradually crumbles. All this time, the disease appears to lay dormant (and only an HIV test will\nreveal that a person even has the disease). But, after three to ten years, enough of the body's defenses are\nbroken down that full-blown AIDS develops. Suddenly, very pronounced symptoms appear, which are\ncalled \"AIDS-related diseases.\" These include pneumo-cystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, found in 60% of\nthose with AIDS), Karposi's sarcoma (a rare type of skin cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; which see),\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis.\nThe less deadly AIDS-related diseases are often the first to appear. The first sign is often the tongue\ncoated with white bumps. This is oral thrush, a type of candida (candidiasis; which see). Intestinal\nparasites (which see) and herpes simplex virus (herpes type I) are two other relatively simple infections\nwhich can occur. All indicate that the body's immune system is damaged, although candida, parasites,\nherpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus, and tuberculosis can occur in those who do not have AIDS.\nMost of those who are HIV-positive eventually develop full-blown AIDS. Once that occurs, they\ngenerally live only a few years. The median survival time, after full-blown AIDS appears, is 26 months.\nResearchers are searching for an \"AIDS cure\"; but the HIV virus changes form so fast, it is unlikely a\ncure will ever be found.\nSome say the origin of AIDS is unknown, and that the earliest documented case of it appeared in 1981 in\nSan Francisco. But there may be undocumented cases of it in the 1970s.\nOthers say that there is a different origin of AIDS. Dr. Eva Snead feels that the virus was created in the\nlaboratories. She insists that, if you have been vaccinated, you have the virus.\nThen there is Dr. William Campbell Douglass, M.D., who, in his book, AIDS the End of Civilization,\nmaintains that the vaccines were made from the kidney of the green African monkeys, and that the\ndisease was purposely invented to eliminate certain people.\nThe disease is transmitted by oral, vaginal, and anal sex; common needles for IV drugs; contaminated\nhospital and dental equipment; commercially prepared blood products; and immunotoxic lubricants. In\nother words, HIV is transmitted by sex, street drug IVs, blood transfusions, and getting someone else's\nblood into your eyes or into cuts on your skin. It is not possible to contract HIV by giving blood.\n\nSymptoms\n\nLoss of appetite, weight loss, candida, fatigue, various infections, intestinal problems,\nskin diseases, immune system disorders, fevers, brain and neurological disorders, and many other\nsymptoms."},{"id":"disease-general-urticaria","title":"Urticaria","lang":"en","text":"Overview\n\n(Nettle Rash)\n\nCauses\n\nOne cause is contact with the nettle plant, which pricks a poison into the skin.

Do not use a\nmatch to get the tick out.\n• Save the tick in a jar. Call a physician if you want it tested immediately. Watch for\nsymptoms over the next 3 weeks.\n• Put suspicious clothing in the dryer for 30 minutes, to kill ticks by dehydration. Washing\nclothes, even in hot water and bleach, does not necessarily kill ticks.\n• Heat relieves pain. Hot baths are helpful. See \"Fevers.\"\nPREVENTION—The best solution to this problem is prevention. Avoid going out in the woods in the\nsummer months, when ticks are the most active (especially June to August). Stay on the center of the\ntrails. Check yourself and your children carefully afterward.\nWear long pants and tuck them into your socks. Wear a long-sleeved shirt with a high neck or scarf, plus\nhat or gloves. If the clothing is light-colored, you can see the ticks better.\nYou may choose to use an insect repellent containing deet (diethyl toluamide). It lasts longer than\nothers, and is said to be safe on the outside. But it is deadly if taken into your body, and dissolves\nplastics and synthetics.\nNot everyone bitten acquires the disease. A high sugar and fat diet attracts insects! The skin eliminates\ntoxins, which attract bugs when the diet is unnatural.\nWhen the blood is pure and the body clean, there is far less likelihood of tick bites and lice infestation.\nA diet high in fiber and natural food will help keep the body clean and protect against infections. Sugar\nattracts insects.\nHerbs useful in preventing infections include: echinacea, goldenseal, garlic, and burdock. Rubbing with\nlemon juice will disinfect the area. Aloe vera on the area will aid in healing.\nVitamins A and C protect against infections. B complex vitamins help keep the blood clean. Eat lots of\ngreens.\nA test is now available, but false positives occur sometimes. So, if you are being treated for Lyme\ndisease and are not getting better, consider having a second test made. One study of nearly 800 people,\ndiagnosed with Lyme disease, revealed that half of them did not have it! Physicians blame false-positive\ntests for this.\n—Also see \"Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.\"\n\nCauses\n\nThe bite of a tiny tick (Ixodes dammini) is primarily carried by deer; but it is also carried, in\nthe eastern states, by white-footed field mice and, in the west, by lizards and jackrabbits. In California it\nis also transmitted by the black-legged tick, carried by wood rats.\nBoth deer ticks and black-legged ticks are very tiny: An adult is less than 1/10th of an inch, and the\nnymph is a pinhead in size. They are much smaller than a dog tick.\nLyme disease most frequently occurs where the white-tailed deer is most abundant, which is the\nnortheastern states. Eight states report 90% of the cases: Connecticut, Massachusetts, California,\nMinnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. But it has occurred in every state\nexcept Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana, and Nebraska. The disease was first identified in the mid-\n1970s in Lyme, Connecticut.\nDogs and cats can collect these special ticks out in the woods and bring them into your home.\nTick bites are generally painless and unnoticed; so the symptoms may not at first, or later, be correctly\ndiagnosed. But in advanced stages, when correct diagnosis finally occurs, the situation may have\nbecome critical.\nThe symptoms are similar to those of multiple sclerosis, gout, and Epstein-Barr virus (chronic fatigue\nsyndrome), all three of which see.\nA test now exists which can detect the bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) which causes Lyme disease.\nAntibodies are present from 3 days to 3 weeks after infection.\nThe majority of cases occur in the summer and fall. After a tick bites, it waits several hours before it\nbegins to feed on the host's blood; and, once it does, it feasts for 3-4 days. The longer the tick remains\nattached, the greater the risk of Lyme disease.\nLyme disease is treatable and almost always curable if correctly diagnosed in the early stages. But,\nbecause the bites are usually painless, the incubation period so long, and the symptoms so varied, the\nproblem may go unrecognized for weeks or months.\nIf you develop a bull's-eye type of rash anywhere on your body, see your health-care provider right\naway.\n\nSymptoms\n\nBetween 2 and 32 days after the bite, symptoms appear: fatigue, flu-like symptoms,\nstiff neck, backache, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nUltimately, enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen may occur, along with irregular heart rhythm,\narthritis, and brain damage.\nSome of these symptoms slowly pass away over 2-3 years. But sometimes symptoms recur later without\nhaving been bitten again.\nBecause this disease is now so prominent, and because it can occur so mysteriously, here are more\ndetailed symptoms on its usual 3 stages (which not everyone goes through):\n1 - Small raised bumps (and/or a rash) appear on the entire body for 1-2 days or several\nweeks and then fades. Fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.\n2 - Weeks or months later, facial paralysis may occur. Frequently, enlargement of the\nspleen and lymph glands occurs and/or severe headaches, enlargement of the heart\nmuscle, and abnormal heart rhythm.\n3 - This can develop into backache, stiff neck, joint pains in the knees, swelling and pain\nin other joints, and even degenerative muscle and joint disease.\nPhysicians especially look for these symptoms, before treating with antibiotics: a small red bump at the\nsite of the tick bite; a bull's-eye rash surrounding it; and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, chills, and\njoint pain. If treatment is postponed until more advanced symptoms develop (heart, brain, or joint\nproblems), drug medications do not work as well."},{"id":"disease-general-bubonic-plague","title":"Bubonic Plague","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Call a physician.

Do this even if, what appears to\nbe, a rabid dog only licks a previous wound on you.\n• For extra precaution, you may apply a tourniquet and a rubber vacuum cup as for a snake\nbite (which see for further details). If acid is not available, you may burn the wound with a\nmagnifying glass in the sunlight. Or use a red-hot iron. Then treat as for a regular burn\nuntil it is healed. This treatment usually prevents further worry. So says this\nbackwoodsman.\n• Jethro Kloss has a lengthy article on this in his book, Back to Eden (pp. 490-495) (see\norder sheet). He also says to put hydrochloric acid on the wound, to neutralize the rabies\npoison in the saliva. Then, after discussing a number of herbal remedies to also use, he\nquotes a scientific paper by an M. Buisson, read to the French Academy of Arts and\nSciences. M. Buisson had accidentally contracted rabies from a women suffering with it.\nBy the time he discovered he had it, the disease was advanced and he knew he was soon to\ndie. Kloss quotes a London newspaper which reported on the scientific paper:\n\"Concluding from these various symptoms that he was suffering with\nhydrophobia, he [Buisson] resolved to make an end of himself by\nsuffocating himself in a vapor [steam] bath. With this view, he raised the\nheat very, very, hot, but was delighted, no less than surprised, to find that all\nhis pains disappeared. He went out of the bath completely cured, ate a\nhearty dinner, and drank more freely than was usual with him. He adds that\nhe has treated more than fourscore persons who have been bitten by mad\ndogs in a similar manner, and they all recovered, with the exception of a\nchild seven years old, who died in a vapour bath he was\nadministering.\"—Kloss, Back to Eden, p. 493.\n• Water therapists normally work with a steam bath temperature of 115o-120o F. (See our\nWater Therapy Manual (see order sheet) for detailed information on steam baths, pp. 131-\n138.) Those with diabetes, valvular heart disease, extreme arteriosclerosis, or emaciation\nshould not use a steam bath.\nKloss also quotes a German newspaper which discussed an incident which happened in Saxony:\n• \"A Saxon forester named Gastell, at the age of 82, unwilling to take to the grave with\nhim a secret of so much importance, has made public in the Leipsic Journal the method\nwhich he used for fifty years, and he affirms he has rescued many human beings and cattle\nfrom the fearful death of hydrophobia. Wash the wound immediately with warm water\nand vinegar; let it dry, and then pour upon the wound a few drops of hydrochloric acid,\nand that will neutralize and destroy the poison of the saliva.\"—Op. cit., p. 494.\nWe included the above as a matter of historical interest. Now we return to modern physiologic and\nmedical theory on rabies:\n• Nearly all human rabies cases result from dog bites. The animal can transmit disease\nbefore it shows symptoms of rabies; but, except in rare instances, the symptoms will\nappear within 10 days if it is rabid. The disease is always fatal, unless it is halted by a\nseries of Pasteur treatments, which are started before symptoms first appear.\n• If at all possible, it is crucial to confine the animal which inflicted the bite so it can be\nobserved. The course of the disease runs so fast that the animal should show symptoms of\nrabies before they begin to appear in the person. If the animal is rabid, it will show clear\nsigns within 2 weeks, then the person bitten should begin the Pasteur series of rabies shots\n(unless circumstances are clear that the animal was not rabid).\n• If the animal got away and cannot be found, then the person should immediately take the\nrabies vaccine series.\n• If the series has already been started, and the animal is then found not to have rabies, the\nPasteur treatments can be stopped.\n• About 10%-12% of persons bitten by a known rabid animal, and not treated, will\ncontract rabies and die. If the Pasteur series is started within 2 weeks or less after the bite,\nabout one-third of 1% of those bitten will die.\n• It is not widely known that rabies is sometimes transmitted accidentally in hospitals.\nRabies in humans is sometimes misdiagnosed as a stroke. After death, some of that rabid\ntissue may be transplanted to another person.\n• If your child's pet hamster bites him, do not think the child needs to start rabies shots.\nKnow that, if you have had that hamster for 3 weeks or more and it shows no symptoms of\nrabies, the hamster does not have rabies.\n• Rabies shots last 10 days and are so difficult to take that the person often goes to the\nhospital for respiratory support while they are in progress.\nSYMPTOMS IN THE DOG—Initially, there is a marked change in its disposition. He will become\nvery friendly or very snappy; the bark becomes hoarse.\nParalysis may soon develop—first the lower jaw, then the hind legs, and gradually the rest of the body.\nBut, instead, the dog wants to run away. It may run for miles, snapping at any creature which comes near\nit.\nFinally, it becomes exhausted and paralysis sets in.\nIf a dog shows signs of rabies, it must be chained (not roped), and observed for 2 weeks.\n—Also see \"Dog or Animal Bite\" and \"Antispasmodic Tincture.\""},{"id":"disease-general-tularemia","title":"Tularemia","lang":"en","text":"Overview\n\n(Rabbit fever)\n\nTreatment\n\nGo to a physician.\n\nCauses\n\nOne cause is the bite of an animal, generally a rabbit. A more frequent cause today (87%) is\ncutting oneself while skinning and dressing infected rabbits or ground squirrels. Often these are wild\nrabbits.\nIf you notice the appearance of symptoms—and you have been working with rabbits, especially wild\nones—then have the condition immediately diagnosed. Sputum samples are highly contagious, so the lab\nshould be warned about your suspicions.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe first indication is a local ulceration at the infection site. About 1-7 days after\ninfection occurs, chills, headache, prostration, and general pains suddenly begin. The disease is\ncharacterized by high fever and recurring chills with drenching sweat. A shallow but ongoing ulcer\ndevelops at the site of the original wound or bite. Lymph glands draining that area become swollen and\npainful (but they should not be lanced!).\nIf not treated, the fever generally lasts 3-4 weeks, and generally is not fatal.

Diagnosis is made from a positive blood test or skin test.\nPREVENTION—Women should avoid cats just prior to, and during, pregnancy. They should only eat\nwell-cooked meat. Better yet, stop eating it entirely, since many diseases are transmitted through eating\nmeat, poultry, fish, and shellfish.\n(Toxoplasmosis)\n\nCauses\n\nThose who keep cats should be aware of this danger. Cat coccidia is caused by a tiny\nprotozoa (Isospora bigemina) which lives in the intestines of cats. Apparently, it is in many cats!\nThis disease is acquired by inhaling or swallowing dust from contaminated kitty litter boxes or outdoor\nsand or dirt piles. But it can also come from eating rare beef. While that protozoa is in an intermediate\nstage, it is outside the cat's intestines—and can enter the human body.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms can mimic the flu, cause headache, high fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes,\nmeningitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, blindness, and diarrhea.\nIf a pregnant woman contracts this disease, it will cause birth defects in the fetus (brain defects,\nblindness, and/or mental retardation)."},{"id":"disease-general-allergies","title":"Allergies","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance (the amount you can take before diarrhea results from\nthe acidity in the C).\n• Take vitamin A and zinc, and be sure and get enough essential fatty acids and vitamin B\ncomplex.\n• Eat a balanced, moderate, nutritious diet and drink enough water—and you will find that\nmany things in your life will improve.\n• Try a fruit and vegetable juice fast for 1-3 days. If you are not thin, repeat it every\nmonth.\n• Here is a good liver flush to take during the fast: 1 teaspoon of olive oil, one-half\nteaspoon of fresh ginger, 1 teaspoon of fenugreek, 1 teaspoon of ground dandelion, the\njuice of 1 fresh lemon, and a pinch of cayenne. Mix it in juice and drink every morning\nduring the fast.\n• Building up the body and avoiding the offensive substances is what you want. Regarding\nthe second, what should you avoid? The simplest solution is to do a pulse test. Include one\ntest item in each meal; take your pulse after each meal, and see if that item raised your\npulse a little. Some people are disturbed each time they ride in a car. Keep searching for\ncauses.\nHere are other ways to have avoidance:\n• Vacuum the house and car more often. Air-condition the house and car. Install an air\ncleaner in your bedroom or get one which connects to your central air conditioner. Buy a\ndehumidifier.\n• Wrap your bedding in plastic. Use a synthetic pillow or none at all. Wash mattress pads\nmore often.\n• Get rid of the old carpets, clean the floors, and either install new carpets or stop using\nthem. Use throw rugs instead.\n• Clean damp areas in your home, such as under the sink and around the bathtub.\n• If you have animals in the house, keep them clean, well groomed and healthy.\nFrequently change cages or wash their bedding. Animals are not involved in allergy as\nfrequently as people think. They seem to be the 'allergy scapegoats'.\nIf you have absolute unmistakable evidence that a pet is the source of an allergy, try\nbathing it and keeping it well groomed. If this fails, be sure to find a good home for the\npet. It is a living thing also and its needs should be respected. As a child with asthma I\nseveral times suffered having my pets taken from me when I would go to certain 'allergy\nspecialists'- it never helped my asthma- and it sure didn't help my emotional\ndevelopment! (temcat edit)\n• Set aside one room which you keep air-filtered.\n—Also see \"Hay Fever.\" Important, also see \"How to Do the Pulse Test,\" immediately below. It explains\nhow to identify food allergies.\n\nCauses\n\nAn allergy is a sensitivity to some particular substance, known as an allergen. It may be\nharmless to some while causing problems for others. The allergen may be a food, inhalant, or chemical.\nIt may be smoke, molds, pollen, perfume, formalin, etc.\nCauses vary widely: There can be urticaria (skin rash with itching) from fish or strawberries; paranoia\nfrom sugar; headaches from perfume; or asthma-like symptoms from sulfite (a preservative in sulphured\nraisins and apricots). The list goes on and on.\nMold is a special problem. It can be in the house, in the food, in the drugs (that is what the penicillin-\ntype drugs are: mold!). Avoid dampness in, or around, your home.\nIt is estimated that 35 million Americans, alone, have some type of allergy.\nUnfortunately, we live in the chemical age. The body cannot handle all the problem substances entering\nit, and it rebels.\n\nSymptoms\n\nDigestive (after eating) symptoms: Dry mouth, food intolerance, stomach ulcers, canker\nsores, excessive tiredness, palpitations, swelled stomach, sweating, mental fuzziness, stinging tongue,\nmetallic taste, heartburn, indigestion, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, food cravings, pains,\nintestinal gas, gall bladder trouble.\nMuscular and skeletal symptoms: Arthritis; aches in neck, back, or shoulders; fatigue; spasms; joint\npain.\nRespiratory and throat symptoms: Cough, asthma, frequent colds, postnasal drip, wheezing, hay fever,\nnosebleeds, chest tightness, hoarseness, shortness of breath, dry or sore throat.\nNervous symptoms: Tachycardia (fast heart rate), palpitations, depression, anger, anxiety, confusion,\nirritability, hyperactivity, restlessness, learning and memory problems.\nSkin symptoms: Blotches, acne, flushing, hives, dark circles under eyes, itching, eczema, psoriasis."},{"id":"disease-general-hay-fever","title":"Hay Fever","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• The most effective treatment is to avoid the irritant.\n• Vitamin C in large doses of 200 mg or more daily greatly helps many with this problem.\n• Vitamin A is essential for proper functioning of the respiratory system. The B complex\n(especially B and B ) help the body produce interferon, to protect the body against\n6 12\nallergens.\n• Calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, and zinc are also important.\n• Be sure and eat green leafy vegetables. Stay on a high-fiber diet.\n• Try eating unprocessed, raw, honey. It is rich in pollen.\n• Water helps flush out the system. Be sure you are drinking enough.\n• Because it firms up blood vessels throughout the body, exercise decreases nasal\nstuffiness.\n• A hot footbath helps relieve nasal congestion.\n• Consider these possibilities: Cold cloths wrung from ice water applied to the forehead\ngreatly help. Change as soon as they warm up. Relief comes in about 45 minutes, but\ncontinue it for 3 hours. Then intermittently for 6 hours. In some, this treatment has\nstopped attacks for the season.\n• Build up the immune system, and clean the blood and colon. Healthy sinuses have moist\nmucous membranes similar to the skin in the mouth. They are able to wash pollen and\nother irritants out of the nasal cavities and down the throat into the stomach, where they\nare neutralized.\n• Guard against chilling. It constricts blood vessels in the skin, driving blood\nelsewhere—including the nasal cavities. This causes a swelling in the sinuses, which\nmakes the symptoms worse.\n• Fenugreek helps eliminate hard mucous from the body. Garlic kills bacteria. Goldenseal\nhelps clear out toxins from the digestive tract.\n• Cover mattress and pillows with plastic. Avoid wool bedding or furniture stuffed with\nhorsehair.\n• If you have animals in the house, keep them clean, well groomed and healthy.\nFrequently change cages or wash their bedding. (temcat edit)\n—Also see \"Allergies\" and \"Asthma.\"\n(Allergic Rhinitis)\n\nCauses\n\nHay fever is most frequently caused by breathing in plant pollens. (Ragweed and grass\npollen are the worst offenders.) The problem tends to be seasonal (spring or fall), according to plant\ncycles. But some may have to suffer with it all year long if they are sensitive to dust, feathers, or animal\ndanders. Such people are said to have perennial allergic rhinitis.\nHay fever is a reaction of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and air passages to such seasonal\npollens, as well as to dust, feathers, animal hair, and other irritants.\nDry, windy, days; riding in an open car; and working in the garden sometimes increase symptoms.\nMorning and evening hours are the most uncomfortable. Midday may be better.\nStressful situations and alcoholic beverages can trigger an attack.\nAnger, resentment, or negative thoughts can increase the symptoms.\nHay fever sufferers frequently also have asthma and dermatitis.\nThe body is trying to clean out toxins and dust. If the diet is not nutritious; if the person is eating too\nmuch or eating foods, such as milk, ice cream, sugar, and white-flour products, the overloaded system\ncannot deal properly with the additional task of resisting the effects of airborne pollens.\n\nSymptoms\n\nItching in the nose, throat, and eyes. Runny or stuffy nose, headaches, pain in the head\nand sinuses, blurred vision, red and itchy eyes, postnasal drip. A clear, watery, discharge from the nose\nand eyes occurs. There is sneezing and nervous irritability."},{"id":"disease-general-food-poisoning","title":"Food Poisoning","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• As soon as you believe you have food poisoning, take a eyedropperful of alcohol-free\ngoldenseal extract every 4 hours for 24 hours. This natural antibiotic will destroy bacteria\nin the intestinal tract. (But never take goldenseal for more than a week at a time, during\npregnancy, or if you are allergic to ragweed.)\n• Take 6 charcoal tablets immediately, and again in 6 hours. They will help neutralize\npoisons in your bloodstream. Drink lots of good water (distilled is best).\n• Telephone your regional Poison Control Center. There is a different phone number for\neach state. Dial the operator (0) or emergency (911) and ask for that number in your state.\n• Use enemas to clean out the colon.\n• Someone should help the one vomiting, so he does not choke. If he does not stop\nvomiting within 24 hours, collect samples for analysis, to identify the poison.\n• Sometimes it is best to induce vomiting. Lobelia will help or drinking water and putting\na finger down the throat.\n• If food poisoning may have occurred in a restaurant or roadhouse, contact the health\ndepartment.\n• If the condition continues, contact a physician.\n• Research at the University of Wolverhamptom, in Britain, disclosed that all types of\ndisease-producing intestinal bacteria died when garlic was present.\n• A severe headache and vomiting soon after a meal may be caused by food allergies,\nwhich see. Charcoal tablets will help solve that problem.\nPREVENTION—It is best to stop eating meat and dairy products or, if you do, be sure they are most\nthoroughly cooked. Check home-canned jars carefully before opening them. Beware of restaurants,\nroadhouses, and salad bars. When eating out, you eat at your own risk. To help protect you, eat 2 garlic\ntablets before you eat anything else. Better yet, pack bag lunches and learn to buy what you need at a\ngrocery store.\nRefrigerate food you buy as soon as you can. Keep perishables refrigerated. Keep food hot or cold; food\nleft at room temperature encourages bacterial growth. Keep the refrigerator set at 40o F. or below, and\nthe freezer set at 0o F. or below.\nMeat, poultry, eggs, and seafood are especially dangerous. They must be cooked thoroughly and hands\nwashed; all utensils touching the raw materials must be sterilized. Do not use recipes calling for raw\neggs which will remain raw or be inadequately cooked. Do not leave mayonnaises, salad dressings, and\nmilk products sitting out at room temperature. Be especially careful at picnics.\nWash kitchen towels and sponges daily with a 1-20 bleach and water solution.\nDo not use bulging cans or products with loose lids or cracked jars! Rusted, sticky, or bent cans should\nbe discarded. Wash lunch boxes and Thermos bottles after each use.\nThaw all frozen foods in the refrigerator.\nWhen reheating food, bring it to a quick boil, and cook it for a minimum of 4 minutes.\nDo not give honey to a young baby below the age of one. Fed by the honey, botulism spores will grow in\nthe infant's intestine, producing botulism toxin.\n\nCauses\n\nEating food containing harmful bacteria causes food poisoning. Each year more than 2\nmillion Americans report food poisoning. Of course, the actual number is far higher. Unfortunately, we\nlive in a poisoned age. About 2 million Americans report food poisoning each year; of that number,\n9,000 people die each year. A far greater number have food poisoning, who think it is the flu.\nA full 90% of botulism cases in the United States are caused by improper home canning. The safest\nmethod is to cook the jarred food in a pressure cooker rather than in a tub on top of the stove.\nTwo-thirds of all food poisoning cases were related to the use of poorly cooked eggs.\nThe types of bacteria in food which cause disease (pathogenic) or produce toxins (toxigenic) cannot be\nseen, tasted, or smelled in the food.\nHere are the most common of these food poisoning organisms:\nSalmonella (Salmonellosis): This is the most common cause of food poisoning. It has especially\nincreased since antibiotics began being placed in animal feeds, to prevent disease in crowded,\nunsanitary, conditions and help them grow faster. (More than 50% of cattle, poultry, and swine are now\ngiven antibiotics.) But, doing this, promoted the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animal\nintestines. A third of all chickens in America have salmonella.\nSalmonella is easily transmitted on hands, food supplies, knives, table tops, cracked eggs, partly raw\nfood, etc. Mechanical methods of evisceration in slaughterhouses also spread salmonella to all the other\nbirds being slaughtered. Cooks that handle raw meat or eggs, and then handle other food—especially\nraw food, such as salads—endanger many people. Vegetarians should wash their hands with soap,\nimmediately after handling raw egg shells. Cook eggs well. (Beware of mayonnaise; it contains raw\neggs.) Milk and ice cream can also be contaminated with salmonella. In 1985, 17,000 people in the\nnortheast became ill from contaminated milk.\nOutbreaks of salmonella poisoning primarily occur in the warmer months. Symptoms range from mild\nabdominal pain to severe diarrhea, and even typhoid-like fever. This disease can so weaken the immune\nsystem that the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels are damaged. Arthritis can result.\nEating raw or poorly cooked chicken, eggs, beef, and pork products is the main way salmonella is eaten.\nBut it can also be found in clams and oysters.\nOf 35 food poisoning outbreaks reported between 1985 to 1987, 24 were caused by contaminated eggs,\nor foods containing them. Boil eggs for at least 25 minutes.\nWe will briefly note some other sources of food-borne illness:\nStaphylococcus aureus: This is said to be the second-largest source of food poisoning (25%). This can\nbe transmitted by coughing and sneezing on food.\nClostridium botulinum: This is old-fashioned botulism. Many restaurants and roadhouses leave food\nsetting out at room temperature for hours. This can also be found in old mustard and other sauce jars.\nAlthough easily destroyed by cold or heat, botulism is the most deadly of all the food-borne diseases. It\nproduces toxins which block nerve impulses to the muscles.\nHeating food to 176o F. for 20 minutes or 194o F. for 10 minutes destroys the spores. Home-canned\nfood, not properly cooked, can be dangerous. Never use contents of a bulging can or a rusty can! It is\nfound in canned vegetables, meats, fish, mushrooms, and soups.\nGiardia (giardiasis): This is found in drinking water from lakes and streams. It is not destroyed by water\ntreatment, including chlorination. It can also be found in raw food which has grown in contaminated\nwater. Giardia grows best where it is cool and damp.\nFour other sources of food poisoning should be mentioned: Staphylococcus, complobacter jejuini,\ncampylobacteriosis, and clostridium perfringens.\nEach of these comes primarily from eating meat, and sometimes dairy products.\nBefore concluding, keep in mind trichinae (trichinella), which is found in pork. Also beware of mold\nfound on food; it can produce poisonous toxins. Do not eat potato sprouts; they have concentrated\nsolanine which can cause hallucinations even after recovery.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPain, vomiting, cramping, weakness, diarrhea, dizziness.\nSymptoms occur quickly, 1-4 hours after eating the contaminated substance. They can last for a few\nhours or a few days.\nSalmonella symptoms: pain, vomiting, and diarrhea can require several days to appear.\nStaphylococcus aureus symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting 2-6 hours after the meal. It is good to\ninduce vomiting, to help rid the system of toxins.\nBotulism symptoms: 12-48 hours after ingestion, symptoms appear. Extreme weakness, double vision,\nswallowing difficulty. Paralysis and death can follow.\nGiardia symptoms: Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, flatulence, and\nvomiting."},{"id":"disease-general-poison-ivy","title":"Poison Ivy","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• If the possibility exists that you may have touched it, wash your hands as soon as\npossible. Carefully wash downward, so the water drips down off your hands rather than up\nyour arms. Wash with soap and water; rinse in running water; wash again with soap and\nwater. Do this several times in order to get the toxic oils off your skin. Then dry and see\nwhat happens.\n• As soon as you touch the plant, try to wash the skin with water, even if no soap is\navailable. The water tends to carry off the oil. If nothing else is available, in an emergency\napply paint thinner, ammonia, or acetone to carry off the oils.\n• Yellow laundry soap is best for this purpose. You want a strong cleansing soap which\ncuts oil and carries it away. An alkaline laundry soap or detergent is the best.\n• In washing the skin, never use a washcloth; it only moves the toxic oil around.\n• Wash clothing and gear in soapy water.\n• Those slightly sensitive to the plant can simply avoid touching or scratching the pimples,\nand the itching will be only slightly noticed. If they wish, they can briefly apply\ncompresses of hot, plain, water to the area.\n• Those strongly sensitive may wish to consult a physician.\n• Keep in mind that, for most people, the treatment for urushiol is to reduce the itching\nuntil the poison eventually leaves the system, at which time the rash completely clears up.\nWhat should you put on the affected area to reduce the itching? Here are several suggestions:\n• Jewelweed always ranks at the top of every list. This is a small plant with dark green\nleaves and red berries, which may be found in your locality. If you are sure it is jewelweed\n(and if you can find it), crush the leaves and rub them lightly on the affected area. Another\nmethod is to ball up the whole plant and wipe it over the area.\n• Other herbs include bloodroot, echinacea, goldenseal, lobelia, myrrh, plantain, or\nSolomon's seal.\n• Another method is to apply a tea made of 50-50 white oak bark and lime water. Place it\non a cloth, cover the area, and reapply as often as needed.\n• Most poisons are either strongly acid or alkaline in pH. For an alkaline antidote to the\nitching, place some form of calcium powder, mixed with water to hold it in place, on the\narea. Calcium gluconate (a dietary calcium supplement) is what the author uses. It nicely\nreduces the itching. An alternate alkaline method is to blend oatmeal into a fine powder,\nand add a small amount of water to make a paste. Goldenseal, a very alkaline substance,\ncan also be used. Banana peels, rubbed directly on the area, bring relief for as long as 4\nhours. Another way is to place calamine lotion on it (but beware of the antihistamine\nadditives in some brands of it; they can produce their own allergic rash). White shoe\npolish (which contains calcium and pipe clay) has also been used, but it may contain\nadditives you do not want.\n• There is also an acid approach to the problem! Acid substances have also been used\nwith success, to reduce itching: Wash lemon juice over the area, then pat dry. Repeat as\nneeded. Vinegar can be used.\n• Wet dressings and soaks are helpful. A physiologic saline solution (2 level teaspoons of\nsalt to a quart of water) is useful.\n• Run hot water (as hot as can be tolerated) over the area. This seems to wash off some of\nthe oils. Itching may stop for several hours. Repeat when needed.\n• When you are finished working on the affected area, you might wish to wash rubbing\nalcohol over the skin exposed to that area. This washes oils off your skin. (But this would\nappear to be a poor solution, since the oiless skin ought to have a higher affinity to the\nurushiol than oiled skin.)\nLearn to identify the plant:\n• Poison ivy is a small plant which, when a bush or tree is nearby, grows as a vine up it.\nGrowing in the eastern states, it has three leaves with a notch in the two outer ones. The\ncentral leaf is at the end of the stalk.\n• Poison oak is a bush, generally small but which can grow taller than a man. Growing in\nthe western states, it has the same three leaf and notch pattern, but the leaves are curly and\nappear thicker—more like a live oak.\n• Poison sumac is also a bush, and, with its compound leaves, looks very much like other\nsumac. It does not have the three-leaf pattern. You are less likely to ever encounter poison\nsumac.\n• Avoid forest or other outdoor wood or leaf fires, if one of the three toxic plants may be\nburning.\n(Poison Oak; Poison Sumac)\n\nCauses\n\nThe three poison plants in North America (poison oak, ivy, and sumac) contain a oily,\nslightly sticky, sap in the flowers, fruit, stem, bark; and roots which, when touched, produces a contact\npapular dermatitis on the skin. The plant has the greatest amount of this sap in the spring and early\nsummer. The poison is urushiol, which has both a plant resin and a volatile oil. Even dead roots and\nstems contain urushiol.\nScratching can transmit the toxic substance to still other parts of the body.\nContact with the poison can be made, not only by touching the plant, but by touching an animal's fur,\ncontaminated clothing, shoes, etc. Smoke from burning plants can, through droplets, transmit it to the\nskin, nose, throat, or lungs. In some cases, children have eaten the leaves or grayish berries and\ndeveloped severe inflammation in the mouth.\nSensitivity to the plant varies from person to person, and even in different times in a person's life.\nLightweight fabrics do not adequately protect against poison ivy or oak.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn those only slightly sensitive to it: One or more small round bumps with a slight pus\narea showing in the center. Each one is extremely itchy. It is slightly itchy until touched by something\n(clothing, a hand, etc.), when it suddenly becomes intensely itchy. Scratching brings momentary relief,\nbut causes redness, rash, and more itching.\nIn those who are very sensitive to it: Extreme redness, rash, and large swelling of the affected area. The\nitch is continuous. Many large blisters develop. As the poison is spread over other parts of the body,\nboth fever and secondary infection may develop.\nSymptoms appear within a few hours to 7 days after contact with the plant."},{"id":"disease-general-worms","title":"Worms","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\nHere are suggestions for purging worms from the body:\n• Aloe vera, taken in any form, is especially helpful in eliminating worms.\n• The following herbs help expel worms: cascara sagrada, wormwood, echinacea,\ngoldenseal, burdock, and black walnut. Do not use wormwood during pregnancy.\n• Grapefruit tea extract helps destroy parasites. Eat black walnut extract, pumpkin seeds,\nfig juice or figs, and chaparral tea or tablets.\n• Take diatomaceous earth capsules for 3 weeks, to get rid of your worms. (Do not\nimagine you do not have some; everyone generally does.) The worm eats this, and it\ncauses them to disintegrate.\n• Clean the colon with enemas and colonics. Take 2 per week for 4 weeks.\n• A hot water enema, with 3 teaspoons of salt to a quart of water, may get rid of\npinworms.\n• Eat a diet high in fiber, primarily from raw vegetables and whole grains.\n• For a time, avoid all sugar foods, including fruits, with the exception of figs and\npineapples.\n• Eat figs and pumpkin seeds. This can be combined with black walnuts.\n• Eat garlic, onions, cabbage, and carrots. They contain natural sulphur which helps expel\nworms. As you might expect, worms do not like garlic.\n• Make sure you are obtaining enough water. Drink only pure water (distilled).\n• To eliminate pinworms: Eat 1-2 bitter melons each day for 7-10 days. It is available in\nAsian markets.\n• To eliminate tapeworms: Fast 3 days on raw pineapple. The bromelain in it destroys\nthose worms.\n• Drink one cup of wormwood tea three times daily between meals.\n• Cut up two raw onions and soak them 12 hours in 1 pint water; strain while squeezing\nout the juice. Drink a cup of this 3 times a day. Along with this, use garlic enemas.\n• Powdered tansy, balmony, bitterroot, and wormwood can be put in capsules.

Watercress,\nwhich is eaten raw as a salad, can have pinworms and tapeworms on it.\n• Do not eat raw or partly cooked fish, beef, or pork.\n• Wash vegetables thoroughly before eating them raw.\n• Wash all underclothing, bed clothes, and sheets frequently in hot water.\n• Have all family members wash their hands frequently, especially after using the toilet,\nbefore meals, and bedtime. Do not bite nails.\n• Clean rooms frequently, especially bedrooms. Put some ammonia on a cloth, to dampen\nit as a dustcloth.\n• Sterilize toilet seats. The infected person should sleep alone.\n—Also see \"Convulsions\" and \"Ringworm.\"\n\nCauses\n\nWorms live in the gastrointestinal tract or burrow from that tract into the muscles.\nThere are several types of parasitic worms which can live in human intestines, including tapeworms,\nhookworms, pinworms, whipworms, and roundworms.\nThe degree of infestation is determined, upon examination, by the type, size, and number of worms\nfound.\nWorms tend to eat your food! They irritate your intestinal lining, and reduce even more the amount of\nnutrients which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The worms also produce toxic waste which is\nharmful to your body.\nCauses include eating raw or poorly cooked meat; eating vegetation, polluted by contaminated water;\nimproper disposal of animal and human waste; and walking barefoot on soil. Scratching the anus will\ntransfer worm eggs on your fingers to anything else you touch.\nPinworms: Very tiny white worms, which cause rectal itching at night. Contracted by eating raw or\npoorly cooked vegetables which have contacted contaminated water. Scratching the anal area can also\ntransmit them on the fingers. (Also see \"Rectal Itching.\")\nTapeworms: Flat worms contracted from eating poorly cooked meat (beef, pork, and fish). The most\ncommon one (beef tapeworm) can grow to 20 feet in length in the human intestine.\nHookworms: Found in southern soil and sand, they enter by boring into the feet, but can also enter when\neating with unwashed hands.\nRoundworms: Most common in children, they bore through the intestinal wall and settle in other organs.\nBecause of the warmth of the bed, worms tend to come out of the anus. So inspect that area on children\nafter they are asleep.\nWorm infestation can lead to arthritis, colitis, fatigue, diabetes, headaches, indigestion, lupus, nausea,\nsinus trouble, back and neck pain, and cancer.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAllergies, diarrhea, constipation, gas and bloating, appetite loss, weight loss, anemia,\nnervousness, sleep disturbances, irritable bowels, anal itching, chronic fatigue, picking at the nose, dry\ncough, teeth grinding, and the appearance of worms in the toilet. Worms sometimes causes spasms or\nconvulsions."},{"id":"disease-general-fungus-growth","title":"Fungus Growth","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Eat a nutritious diet, supplemented with vitamins and minerals.\n• Avoid mucous-forming foods (milk and white- flour products). Do not eat meat or\nprocessed foods.\n• Keep body parts clean and dry.\n• Apply crushed garlic to the affected area on the outside of the body, alternating with\nhoney.\n• Another formula for fungal infections of any kind is tea (te or tee) tree oil. Place some on\nthe affected area for 2-3 weeks and the problem may be eliminated. Tea tree oil smells\nlike eucalyptus, and also comes from Australia.\n• Fungus under the nails: This is a special problem, and quite difficult to solve. It may\ntake six months of careful work before results begin to be seen. The fungus is generally\nunder one or more toenails, and causes them to warp out of shape.\n• Potassium permanganate is the remedy used on this for decades. This is poison, yet used\nexternally, it seems to be one of the best solutions to the problem. Permanganate is a\npowerful fungus killer! And fungus under the nails demands something very special. The\npermanganate also stains the skin dark brown, so after soaking your toes or feet in the\nsolution, they will not look very pretty. Formula: Soak the feet for half an hour in a warm\n1:5,000 solution of potassium permanganate. Dry the feet thoroughly after use. This is the\nsame formula for athlete's foot, which is a similar fungal foot disease.\n• If you need to prepare this solution at home, you dissolve a slightly rounded teaspoon of\nthe crystals in 8 ounces of water. Keep it in a dark-colored glass bottle. A teaspoon of this\nsaturated solution in a pint of water makes a solution of about 1:1,500 strength; a teaspoon\nin a quart of water makes one of about 1:3,000 strength. With this information, you will be\nable to prepare about any strength you might need.\n• The above is one of the few powerful poisons mentioned in this book. Do not let a child\ndrink it!\n—See \"Ringworm,\" \"Athlete's Foot,\" and \"Candidiasis\" for much more information.\n\nCauses\n\nThis substance is fungus, which is also called yeast or mold. It can grow under the nails,\ncausing them to become raised and misshapen (see \"Ringworm\"). It can grow on the feet and toes (see\n\"Athlete's Foot\"). It can grow in the throat, intestines, or vagina (see \"Candidiasis\").\nCauses include a depressed immune function, taking antibiotics, or having the body damp too much of\nthe time.

Keep doing this until it bleeds\nfreely. If necessary, cut the area open with a clean, sharp, razor blade. You must get air to\nthe wound and get it to bleed freely.\n• Then wash it well with soap and water; pour in hydrogen peroxide and let it fizz. Get the\nblood flowing again. Then wash the area with pure water, pat dry with a sterile cloth, and\ncover with a bandage.\n• Call a physician. If symptoms of tetanus begin appearing, call a physician at once! It is\nnot too late.\nHere is what nature healers in out-of-the-way places do, when there are no physicians available:\n• Take cramp bark tea in teaspoon doses.\n• Grind up some peach leaves and apply directly to the wound after washing it. Change\nthis raw poultice twice a day.\n• Heat some turpentine and apply to the wound; massage it over the jaw, neck, and spine\nwhen symptoms of lockjaw are suspected.\n• Use 2 cups of wood ashes per gallon of water, and soak the limb or punctured part in it.\nIf the wound is located where it cannot be soaked, apply the ash solution in a fomentation.\nDo this for an hour, and repeat if danger is suspected.\n• If lockjaw actually appears and the person shows stiffening, give 10 drops of\nantispasmodic tincture every 15 minutes until the stiffening is gone.\nThe formula for the tincture is as follows:\n• Into a large-mouth, glass, quart jar, put 1 ounce each of the following herbs (they should\nbe in ground form or you should grind them first): skullcap, skunk cabbage root or seed,\ngum myrrh, lobelia seed (or plant if seed is not obtainable), and black cohosh root. Mix\nthem in the jar while dry, and add one pint of pure grain alcohol of 70 to 100 proof; 80\nproof Vodka works well. Let this stand for 10-14 days, tightly covered, and shaken well\nonce a day. Then strain it through a very fine cloth and squeeze out all the sediment you\ncan. Keep the tincture in a tightly covered jar. Put some into a small dropper bottle. It is\ntaken internally in 8-10 drop doses.\n• In addition to the above, also give the person lobelia and cayenne. Prepare it by boiling a\nquart of water, take it off the stove, and put a teaspoon lobelia powder and a teaspoon\nground cayenne into the water. Let it stand 20 minutes and drink ¼ cup every half hour till\nrelieved.\n(Lockjaw)\n\nCauses\n\nTetanus is caused by the toxin (waste product) of clostridium tetani, which normally lives in\nanimal manure.\nPuncture wounds from stepping on dirty nails is the most likely immediate cause. The germ only grows\nwhere there is little or no oxygen. The spores (seeds) were on that nail and, entering the body, begin to\ngrow and multiply. But the spores must penetrate deep enough; they cannot grow if oxygen is present. It\nis the toxin that the growing tetanus produces, which paralyzes voluntary muscle tissue, including the\njaw muscle (the masseter).\nTetanus is not common; but, if contracted, it is extremely dangerous.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms generally appear within 5-10 days. Possible discomfort at the site of the\nwound. Stiffness on opening and closing the mouth, and the person becomes restless and apprehensive.\nMuscle stiffness and spasms increase and spread to more muscles in the body. The face becomes\ncontorted, and the slightest noise or disturbance produces muscle spasms.

Telephone the\noperator (0) or emergency (911), and they can direct you to your nearest Poison Control\nCenter.\n• Many poisons are strong acids or strong alkalies. In such cases, the antidote will have the\nopposite pH. But the PCC will know what the antidote should be. The PCC will have even\nbetter data on the substance than will be found on the label of the product. Then contact a\nphysician.\n• If the poison is on the outside of the body, flush with plenty of water. If inside, follow\ndirections on the label if no other information is available.\n• Many poisons can be counteracted by taking an emetic to cause vomiting. (In the case of\ncertain caustic poisons, vomiting is not the best.) Put a teaspoon of salt in 2 cups of warm\nwater and drink it quickly. This will usually produce vomiting. Repeat a second or third\ntime if necessary. Tickle the throat with a finger. After vomiting has occurred, induce\nmore vomiting.\n• If the person has swallowed a caustic acid, swallow soda, chalk, lime water, milk, or\nvegetable oil first to neutralize the acid in the stomach; then induce vomiting.\n• If the person has swallowed a strong alkali, then first neutralize it with lemon or vinegar.\n• Swallow lots of powdered charcoal in water.\n• After swallowing the powdered charcoal, to help heal the stomach, drink a tea of white\noak bark, alfalfa, oregano, or sweet basil.\n• If bits of glass from a broken bottle got into the food and some was swallowed, eat lots\nof soft bread. This sticky dough will tend to wrap around the glass and may help carry it\nsafely through the intestines.\n• Cleanse the body; eat nutritious food. Include lots of fiber, including pectin in apples;\nthis helps discharge metals from the body. Have a hair analysis made. It will tell you how\nmuch you have. Whole grains are all high in fiber. A urine analysis can also identify the\nmetal excess or deficiency.\n• Vitamin A helps the body discharge poisons. Deficiency of vitamin A can cause lesions\nfrom radiation, antibiotics, and metal poisoning. The B complex vitamins protects the\nnervous system and help the liver detoxify the blood. Deficiencies of vitamin B suppress\n6\nthe immune system. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and prevents free-radical damage.\nCalcium and magnesium are natural chelating minerals. Selenium enhances the functions\nof vitamin E. Zinc is a free-radical inhibitor, and helps utilize vitamin A.\n• Herbs which help counteract metal poisoning include Burdock, alfalfa, chaparral,\ndandelion, echinacea, fennel, garlic, juniper, kelp, lobelia, and cayenne.\n• Eat eggs, onions, beans, legumes, and garlic to obtain sulfur to counteract the arsenic.

If\nsupplementary treatment is given, the crisis can be weathered easier, and with less\nlikelihood of a return to smoking.\n• In order to quit, it is best to accompany a firm decision with a cleansing program. This\nhelps speed up the elimination of stored-up nicotine and other poisons. The quicker this\nhappens, the faster the cravings cease.\n• A nutritious diet must be adhered to. Carrot juice and citrus juices are very helpful.\nVitamin C is important.\n• Take the tobacco pack or can and throw it away. In its place put a candy bar. Blood\nsugar level is a factor in the addiction. When the cravings are successful gone, throw away\nthe candies.\n• Take extra calcium and eat chamomile 3-6 times a day. Both will help relax during the\nwithdrawal period. Vitamin B complex is also important for the nerves.\n• Lobelia contains lobeline, which is similar to nicotine. It is non-addictive, but helps a\nperson quit tobacco. Here is how to use it in aversion therapy:\n• Only smoke one hour each day, at which time 15 drops of lobelia, diluted in water, are\nswallowed every half an hour and then 15 minutes before lighting the first cigarette. With\neach 15-minute period, an additional 15 drops are added to the water to drink—while the\ncigarettes are smoked. The result will be nausea, which the person will associate with the\ncigarettes. This kills the desire for the cigarettes.\n• If the lobelia method is not used, the alternative must be a definite quit all at once\napproach. See the author's book.\nHYDRO—Here are suggestions from the author's book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):\nHeating and Sweating Packs are also used for the elimination of nicotine from the body, which lessens\nthe physical craving for more tobacco (p. 64).\nThe Steam Bath is also useful in tobacco addictions (p. 131).\nEliminating the tobacco habit: Drop the drug at once. Put him to bed. Sweating procedures (such as\nRadiant Heat Bath, Steam Bath, sweating Wet Sheet Pack), twice daily; follow with short cold\napplication, as Shallow Cold Bath, Wet Sheet Rub, or Cold Douche. Alternate hot and cold Compress to\nspine 3 times a day; Hot Abdominal Pack day and night, renewing 3 times daily; copious water drinking;\nlarge Colonic daily (p. 192).\n—See the author's book, You can Quit Tobacco (see order sheet), now in his book compilation, Help for\nYour Family (see order sheet). It is full of worthwhile information.\n\nCauses\n\nNicotine is remarkable for the vast number of harmful chemicals it naturally contains, and\nthose which are added to it during growth or processing of the leaves. Nicotine is also remarkable for its\naddictive qualities. It ranks with heroin, and some who have been hooked on both declare it to be worse\nto quit than heroin. Like heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, tobacco gives a sense of relaxing while making\nthe heart pump harder (12-25 beats per minute faster), causing palpitations and a generalized feeling of\nanxiety. For the smoker who takes the last puff before bedtime, the circulatory system is only normal 2\nhours out of every 24.\nEach cigarette destroys 25 mg of vitamin C; a full pack in one day eliminates more of this vitamin than\nis in the diet.\nIn America alone, tobacco causes 35% of all cancer deaths, 78% of all fatal heart attacks, 18% of deaths\nof all kinds, 85% of lung cancer, and 85% of obstructive pulmonary disease. More Americans die each\nyear from smoking than from alcohol, illegal drugs, traffic accidents, murder, or suicide. Those coffin\nnails shorten lifespan by at least 15-20 years. These are some of the blessings you get from the nicotine:\nlead, carcinogens, cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and over 5,000 other irritating\nchemicals in tobacco. Tobacco not only injures you, but it also damages those around you: your spouse,\nyour children, your unborn, and fellow workmen. Did you know that the breath of a smoker contains\nslightly more nicotine than the side smoke from his cigarette? Men and women who smoke are\nconstantly exhaling air into the room for their children to breathe.\n\nSymptoms\n\nA continual craving for tobacco in some form.\nIf the person smokes, there is irritation and inflammation of throat and lungs, chronic cough, chronic\nbronchitis, and premature aging of the skin. This eventually leads to lung cancer, high blood pressure,\nosteoporosis, emphysema, respiratory ailments, heart disease, stroke, and/or many other diseased\nconditions and cancers. Women will have intensified problems with menstruation and menopause, and\nmen will have greater prostate trouble. Women who smoke age twice as fast as other women. Their skin\nrapidly ages; and the result is a dull, lifeless, gray, deteriorating complexion, and wrinkles.\nIf one chews tobacco, there is irritation and inflammation of the lips, mouth, teeth, throat, and\nesophagus. This eventually leads to cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, and\nother diseases."},{"id":"disease-general-alcohol-withdrawal","title":"Alcohol Withdrawal","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Stop drinking alcohol entirely. Begin eating very nutritious food. Vitamins A, B\ncomplex, C, D, and K are needed, in addition to zinc, iron, potassium, calcium, essential\nfatty acids, bioflavonoids, and adequate protein. Sea kelp is important, to help the thyroid.\n• Certain foods increase the craving for alcohol in those who indulge in it. These include\nmilk, wheat, corn products, chocolate, and sugar.\n• After going off alcohol, do not substitute large amounts of sugar products and strong\ncoffee. Sugar only increases the hypoglycemic problem. Nourish the system with good\nfood; do not sugarize it.\n• The alcoholic craves potassium. A tablespoonful of honey, to take the place of a beer,\nsupplies some of the potassium which has been depleted by the alcohol. Also high in\npotassium is potato peel soup. The peelings should be about a half inch thick; discard the\nrest of the potatoes. Cover with water, cook well, then blend and add a little salt. He\nshould eat it often with his meals.\n• A teaspoon of 50-50 powdered charcoal and honey will help sober up a drunk person.\n• People who regularly eat good nourishing food are less likely to crave stimulants or\naddictive substances. Especially eat raw fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Meat eating will\nbring back the craving for alcohol, so quit meat.\n• Slippery elm is also good to drink while going off alcohol.\n• Quassia chips help destroy the taste for liquor. Put 1 teaspoon in a cup of boiled water,\nsteep a half hour, covered. Take a swallow every 2 hours.

It then\ntravels in the bloodstream to every cell in the body, where it extracts water. This weakens or kills cells.\nThe effect on the liver, brain, and vital organs is especially damaging. Most alcoholics are either\nhypoglycemic or borderline diabetics.\nIn addition, alcohol produces severe nutritional deficiencies. The body thinks it is well-fed (alcohol\ncontains 70 calories per ounce), when it is being slowly starved.\nThe liver slowly breaks the alcohol down to sugar. Eventually the difficult task weakens this vital organ,\nand fatty liver degeneration begins. Scar tissue develops; the experts call it cirrhosis.\nAlcohol is deceptive: It makes a person feel happy when he is miserable, and makes him feel strong\nwhen he is weak. It ruins his liver, destroys his marriage, hurts his children, eliminates his employment,\nand makes a bum out of him. The liquor industry should be closed down.\n\nSymptoms\n\nDependence on, and addiction to, alcoholic beverages. Depression; blackouts;\nhangovers; vehicle, and other, arrests; ulcers; emotional problems; flushing of the face; forgetfulness;\nheart palpitation; indigestion; insomnia; urinary problems; hepatitis; hypertension; divorce; hard drugs;\nand numbness in the extremities."},{"id":"disease-general-coffee-withdrawal","title":"Coffee Withdrawal","lang":"en","text":"PROBLEMS—Coffee and black tea are both addictive and damaging to the system.

Unfortunately, the ultraviolet rays also cause\nwrinkles and 90% of all types of skin cancer. (It can cause cataracts too.) Yes, continue to\nget out in the sunlight, but try not to overdo it. Keep in mind that, in the early stages, it is\nnot difficult to remove skin cancers; but you have to have a certain amount of sunlight for\ngeneral physical health. Be especially careful between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when sunlight\nis strongest.\n• Those with a family history of skin cancer should obtain their sunlight more sparingly.\n• In the summer, wear light-colored clothing which has a tight weave. Consider using a\nsunscreen of at least 15.\n• Tanning salons are more dangerous than sunlight, because people tend to overdo them.\n• As the ozone layer is gradually destroyed over the north and south poles, those living in\nthe temperate zones throughout the world become more susceptible to skin\ncancer—without even being in the sun.\n• Every month or so check over your body carefully and look for signs of skin cancer.\nThen do something about it.\nSuggestions for eliminating the skin cancer:\n• You can go to your physician, and he will excise it with a knife or an ointment which\nwill burn it off. If you delay, surgery will cut more deeply and, as with all cancer surgery,\nthere is the very real danger that not all the cancer will be removed.\n• Or you can use natural remedies. Fortunately, with skin cancer, as long as it is treated in\nthe early stages, you can tell if it is gone!\n• Garlic is a faithful standby. Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you\nconsider might be, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If you\ncan't avoid it, the skin will redden and burn somewhat.) Russian research, from back in the\n1950s, revealed that garlic is more powerful than antibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also\ncauses moles and skin cancers to fall off.\n• Put the garlic on in the morning; take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening\nbefore bedtime. Put on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the\nprocess. Do this for about 3 days. The mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the\narea heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process at a later time.\n• If you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the\nskin (you will know, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not\nnecessary to slough off the cancer, and could be harmful.\n• The herb, chaparral, works well for skin cancer. Take it as a tea or in tablet form.\n• According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate\namount of essential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancers. It even helps\neliminate them, once they form.\n• Eat a nourishing diet; go off meat and processed, fried, and junk food. Get enough rest.\nRight living helps your body resist and throw off cancerous lesions.\n• Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance; also take vitamin A and selenium.\n• Carcelim is a cream which you can purchase, which requires 30 days to remove the\nmelanoma.\n—Read the sections on \"Cancer\" and \"Cancer Prevention\" for detailed information.\n(Melanoma)\n\nCauses\n\nSkin cancer is also called melanoma, or lentigo-maligna melanoma, and appears on body\nsurfaces which are most frequently exposed to the sunlight: the face, neck, arms, and trunk. It can also\noccur on the lips and even eyelids.\nThe best thing about skin cancer is that it is often slow in spreading and invading the deeper layers of the\nskin. As long as the cancer is only on the surface, it can easily be removed.\nThere are three types of skin cancer; the first two are the most common, and the third is the most\ndangerous. Yet all three types can be eliminated if treated early. The medical route or natural methods\ncan be used to eliminate each of these. But, either way, be sure it is gone. As long as it is treated early,\nyou can easily see if it is gone.\nBasal cell carcinoma: This is the most common type, and the slowest growing. It does not spread until it\nhas been present for a number of years. It is an ulcer-like growth which spreads very slowly. The first\nsign is a large pearly lump, generally on the face, nose, or area around the eyes. About six weeks later it\nbecomes an ulcer with a moist center and a hard border which may bleed. Scabs continually form, then\ndrop off, but with no healing of the ulcer. Another form is flat sores which slowly widen. Treatment is\nthe same as for squamous cell cancer.\nSquamous cell carcinoma: Due to damage to lower-skin surface, a lump forms on the skin. Looking like\na wart or a nonhealing ulcer, physicians cut it off, freeze it off, chemical it off, or irradiate it off. A skin\ngraft may be applied afterward.\nMelanoma: This is the most dangerous of the three, and can run in families. It often begins as what\nappears to be a mole. Most people have moles, but be especially beware of those which appear after the\nage of 40. Any mole that is unusual or that changes in size or color should be eliminated. If in doubt, see\na physician!\nA melanoma mole arises out of the deeper pigment layer of the skin. For this reason, it spreads more\nquickly. Melanomas most frequently occur on the upper back and legs. But they may also occur on\nmucous membranes or under the nails.\nA fourth type of skin cancer might be noted here. It is the rare mycosis fungoides. For years there will be\nitching skin lesions. Eventually they become firm and begin ulcerating. Later they involve the lymph\nnodes and produce cancer of the lymph (lymphoma).\nOver 600,000 Americans develop skin cancer each year, and 10,000 die of it. More than 90% of skin\ncancers can easily be eliminated, if done so early.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIdentification is especially important in dealing with skin cancer. Here are official\nwarning signs of skin cancer:\n1. An open sore that bleeds, crusts over, and will not heal properly.\n2. A reddish, irritated, spot that is usually on the chest, shoulder, arm, or leg. It may itch,\nhurt, or cause no discomfort at all.\n3. A smooth growth with an elevated border and a center indentation. As it becomes\nbigger, tiny blood vessels develop on the surface.\n4. A shiny scar-like area that may be white, yellow, or waxy with a shiny, taut,\nappearance.\n5. An enlarging, irregular, \"angry\" appearing lesion on the face, lips, or ears.\nHere is a description of one of the more common types of skin cancer: large flat, tan, or brown spots,\nwith darker black or brown areas dotted on its surface. The edges may, or may not, be clearly defined.\nThe spot may appear mottled.\nMoles should also be watched—especially those that change in size or color, are irregularly shaped,\nhave ridges around the edges, widen, bleed, itch, or seem to be continually irritated by clothing.\nHere are still more identifiers of skin cancer—the so-called \"A-B-C-D checklist\":\nAsymmetry: Both sides of the mole should be shaped similarly. If the overall shape is\nirregular, then it might be skin cancer.\nBorder: The edges of moles should be smooth, not blurred or ragged.\nColor: It should be tan, brown, and dark brown if it is normal. If it is red, white, blue, or\nblack, it is not.\nDiameter: Any mole that is larger than ¼ inch in diameter, or whose diameter seems to be\nincreasing, should be treated with suspicion.\nSpots which are dry, red, and scaly (most frequently found on the face, neck, or backs of hands) may be\nactinic (solar) keratoses. These are lesions which result from years of overexposure to the sun. They can\nbe precancerous. Later they may become hard to the touch and grayish or brown in color."},{"id":"disease-general-cancer","title":"Cancer","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Cancer is a systemic disease, affecting the entire body and caused by conditions in the\nentire person. So it cannot be treated by specifics. An entire change in one's way of life is\nrequired.\nFor an in depth look at cancer prevention see \"Tumors, Cancer - Part 2\".\nFor much, much more information on Cancer, see the author's book, Alternate Cancer Therapies\n(see order sheet).\n\nCauses\n\nIn this article, you will find an overview of many research studies and data.\nCancer is now the second most common killer in the United States and is increasing. One in every three\npeople will die from some form of it. Over 1,400 Americans die each day with it.\nCancer cells are wild, irregular, and different from other body cells. They grow rapidly and gradually\ninvade and fill surrounding areas. They rob neighboring cells of nutrition, resulting in a gradual wasting\naway of the patient. They can migrate to new locations and multiply. Wherever they go, there are\nabnormal growths and tumors.\nCancer cells are classified by the organs they initially invade (liver, breast, colon, lung, lip, etc.). There\nare more than 100 different varieties of cancer. Each varies in its symptoms and how fast it spreads.\nThere are four main types of cancer: Carcinomas affect the skin, mucous membranes, glands, and other\norgans. Leukemias are blood cancers. Sarcomas affect muscles, connective tissue, and bones.\nLymphomas affect the lymphatic system.\nEarly detection and treatment is vital. One person dies every 3 minutes from cancer.\nDr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner, stated: \"More is known about the cause and prevention of cancer\nthan most any other disease.\"\nDr. Ronald Raven, Chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, said: \"Seventy-five percent\nof all cancer can be prevented if we utilize the facts we now possess.\"\nAt the Eighth International Cancer Congress, Dr. Kavetsky said: \"It is essential in the treatment of\ntumorous disease, not only to act on the tumor, but to endeavor to strengthen the compensatory and\ndefensive reaction . . of the entire system.\"\nWhen a cancer becomes noticed, it is already far advanced. At this stage, it is important that the one with\nit place himself under the care of a competent physician who understands and uses nutritional therapy.\nHowever, the patient needs to understand, for himself, what is required and what he must do. There are\nsituations in which a cancer victim has no one to help him, and he must carry out such a program\nentirely on His own.\nBut, whether helped by others or going it alone, unless the individual fully cooperates with right\nprinciples, he cannot be successfully helped. He must cease his violations of the natural laws, given by\nGod to mankind, and live fully in accordance with them.\nThe type of food we eat, the way we live, and environmental factors gradually build up or weaken the\nbody. If the organs of elimination cannot keep up with the amount of toxic waste we are producing, in\ndesperation the body eventually turns to the formation of tumors and cancers. Soft cancers are cells gone\nwild because of the excess waste in the system. Hard tumors are garbage cans prepared to hold the toxic\nwaste.\nCancer generally has a lengthy incubation period of years. Nourishing the body, building up the immune\nsystem, and avoiding excess and debilitating substances enables the body to resist cancer.\nBecause of intemperate living, eating, sleeping, combined with stress, the body is weakened over the\nyears. This produces a chronic autointoxication—poisons have accumulated in the body. Vital organs,\nwhose job it is to purify and eliminate wastes (such as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bowels),\nbecome less active and efficient. The system becomes poisoned. These poisons accumulate around the\nweakest organs or where the body has been injured by a bruise, fall, or blow. The accumulated poisons\nfrom years of tea, coffee, tobacco, cola, meat, liquor, fried food, etc., especially accumulate in such an\narea. Then the body either tries to build garbage cans (tumors), to hold the waste products or the cells in\nthat area go wild from the irritation; so cancer cells form and spread. It is well-known that irritation,\nsuch as always picking at a certain spot, can cause cancer.\nUnfortunately, there are also toxic substances in the air, water, and soil. This makes it the more crucial\nthat we live as carefully as we can.\nPrevention of cancer requires effort; yet many people give more attention to caring for their prize dogs\nor their new cars. The human body requires careful attention also.\nDrs. Hans Nieper and Dean Burk stated that, by the time the tumor is present, a patient's malignancy is\nalready far advanced. As noted earlier, a tumor is something of a strange parasite, which has as little as\n2% of normal blood circulation. Its cells are living on sugar fermentation instead of oxygen as normal\ncells do. It is more like a plant or fungus.\n—Additional causal factors will be noted in Cancer Prevention.\nHere are two interesting facts: (1) The U.S. Government declares that the five-year survival rate from\ntaking the officially authorized cancer remedies (chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation) has not changed\nover the past 20 years.

Chemotherapy, for example,\nproduces hair loss, extreme nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, sterility, and damage to the liver,\nkidneys, and heart. What should you do? That is your decision. On one hand, you can take the officially\nrecommended remedies at your local hospital. Or you can try natural remedies. Your choice.\nSome of the natural folk remedies are listed here. There are many others.\nHowever, you should know that the government and the medical association advises that you should\nnever treat yourself for cancer. Their counsel is that you consult a medical doctor (M.D.), and follow his\nadvice explicitly. Not to do so, they say, could result in your death.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe most common symptoms of cancer: any sore that does not heal on the skin, mouth,\ntongue, or lips. Any irregular or unusual bleeding or discharge from any body opening. A persistent\nchange from normal in the action of the bowels or bladder. Any persistent lump or thickening in breast\nor anywhere on the body. Hoarseness or nagging cough. Difficulty in swallowing. Persistent indigestion\nor loss of appetite, especially if accompanied by loss of weight. Sudden or rapid changes in the form,\nappearance, or rate of growth of a mole or wart or if it bleeds. Fatigue.\nTo the basic eight cancer signs, listed above, we are adding three others which are important: any\ncondition which does not respond to treatment, inflammation from blood clotting (thrombophlebitis),\nand putrid intestinal gas.\nSkin cancer: A lump under the skin, moles which change color or size and have raised edges, an ulcer\nwhich does not heal, flat sores, lesions which look like moles.\nMouth or throat: Chronic ulcer of the mouth, tongue, or throat which does not heal.\nLarynx: Persistent cough and hoarse throat.\nLung: Persistent cough, bloody sputum, and chest pain.\nBreast: Lump which is hard, does not go away, and does not move; inflammation or thickening of the\nskin. (See \"Breast Cancer\" for more signs.)\nLeukemia: Whiteness of skin, weight loss, fatigue, repeated infections, easy bruising, nosebleeds.\nStomach: Indigestion and pain after eating.\nBladder and Kidney: Blood in urine and increased urination frequency. Bloody urine is generally not a\ncancer symptom, but it can be.\nOvaries: Usually there are no obvious symptoms until later stages.\nEndometrium: Bleeding between menstrual periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.\nCervical and Uterine: Bleeding between periods, unusual discharge, painful periods, heavy periods.\nProstate: Weak or interrupted urine flow; continuous pain in lower back, pelvis, and/or upper thighs.\nTesticles: Enlargement of a testicle, lumps, thickening of scrotum, sudden excess of fluid in scrotum,\nmild ache in lower abdomen or groin.\nColon: Blood in stools, rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea and/or constipation).\nLymphoid Tissue: Enlarged, rubbery, lymph nodes; itching; night sweats; unexplained fever and/or\nweight loss."},{"id":"disease-general-leukemia","title":"Leukemia","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Treatment may include DMSO IV (which matures the immature cells in circulation),\nlaetrile, germanium, selenium, vitamin A, and vitamin C to bowel tolerance.\n—For information on some of the natural remedies which you may wish to consider, read the sections\non \"Cancer\" and \"Cancer Prevention\".\n\nCauses\n\nThis is called cancer of the blood, but it is actually cancer of the bone marrow, where the\nblood is made.\nLeukemia (which means \"white blood\") produces a defect in the production of white blood cells,\nresulting in large numbers of immature WBCs in the blood stream.

Avoid noise, smog,\ntelevision, worry, stress, and confusion. Do some reading every day. Reading in God's Word,\naccompanied by simple trustful prayer brings healing to heart, soul, and body.\n• Dr. Josef Issels' cancer clinic, in Germany, is an example of a well-rounded program. In addition to\nother things mentioned in this book, he prescribes plenty of rest, complete freedom from worries and\nmental stress, and plenty of fresh, pure air day and night. To the degree the patient is strong enough\nfor it, and as he improves, there is lots of exercise and walking.\n• Some, in a position to do so, may wish to move to a warm, unpolluted climate (any left?) where fresh\nair and sunshine is continually available. Build up the system with good food, exercise, and rest.\n• Continual overwork and exhaustion can lay the groundwork for the development of cancer.\n• City living, with its hurry, noise, confusion, and air and water pollution, can also provide the\ninferior living conditions which lead to malignant conditions.\nWORRY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS\n• Stress is also considered a significant factor. More and more research indicates that, as Dr. H.F.\nDunbar says, \"only certain types of people succumb to cancer.\"\n• Two Soviet researchers (Serov and Troskin) demonstrated that negative emotions reduce the white\nblood count in an alarming manner, hindering a major body defense against disease.\n• Researchers at the Rochester Medical Center in New York have found that people are more likely to\ncontract cancer if, more than others, they have a harder time dealing with severe emotional conflicts\nand stresses, have uncontrolled anxieties and worries, experience traumatic emotional experiences\nor losses, have strong feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, hopelessness, and desperation. It may not\nbe that such negative attitudes cause the cancer, but they keep the person from resisting and conquering\nit.\n• Maintain a strong sense of purpose. Find something to do with yourself. In one church which the\nauthor once pastored, a woman bedridden for years before her death would phone people at random and\nencourage and pray with them. Between calls, she would pray for them.

Here, briefly, are several\nof his points:\n• Sunlight can change cholesterol near the skin surface into free radicals, which can cause cancer. But a\ngood diet will eliminate the free radicals.\n• A high-fat diet increases the likelihood of skin cancer. This includes too much oil of any kind in the\ndiet—grease, hydrogenated oil, trans-fat, and vegetable oil.\n• Trans-fat (fat which is not polyunsaturated) stops oxygen utilization by the cell, and leads to cancer.\nLiquid vegetable oil can be up to 6% trans-fat, margarines up to 54%, and solid shortening up to 58%.\n• If you are on a low-fat diet, sunlight hitting your skin actually inhibits cancer."},{"id":"disease-general-protein","title":"Protein","lang":"en","text":"• Our actual daily protein requirement is 20-30 grams a day, but many eat over 100 a day.

Obesity is another factor linked to cancer, especially in women. Overweight\nwomen more frequently have cancer of the uterus, and do not recover as easily from breast cancer.\n• Accumulated fatty tissue in the body affects female hormones. The more that is present, the more\nestrogen is produced and converted into a special type of endocrine substance which stimulates cells to\ndivide in the breast and reproductive system. Overweight men and women are more likely to develop\ncancer.\n• A high-fat diet dramatically increases the occurrence of colon, breast, endometrium, and ovarian\ncancer, as compared with a low-fat diet. Eating a lot of fat encourages the development of cancer in both\nmen and women. Colon cancer is more likely to occur in men.\n• Those who eat the most saturated fat are twice as likely to develop polyps.\n• Dr. Ott Warburg, made that discovery in the 1920s. He demonstrated that the metabolism of cancerous\ntissue differs radically from that of normal tissue. A regular cell is nourished by oxygen which it uses to\nbreak down nutriments; without oxygen it dies. But a cancer cell lives by using chemicals to break down\nnutriments—not oxygen—and needs little or no oxygen to exist. The tumor, being a parasite, has a\nrestricted circulation of blood, sometimes as low as 2% of normal, hence it lives on fermentation of\nsugar, like a plant or fungus, instead of oxygen. Later experiments by Warburg revealed that normal\nliving tissue will become cancerous, if deprived of oxygen. It was this research which brought Warburg\nthe Nobel Prize.\n• Since the blood provides the cells with oxygen, Warburg concluded that the condition of the\nbloodstream played an important part in the development of cancer. This is substantiated by the fact\nthat malignant tumors are frequently found near scars, at the sides of ulcers, in atrophied organs, or\nwherever the blood supply is poor.\n• Rancid oils and heavy protein diets thicken the blood, and weaken its ability to transport food and\noxygen to the cells.\n• Unlike other cells, cancer cells do not need oxygen. Rancid oils and fats are dangerous, for they\ndecrease oxygenation and weaken normal cells while strengthening cancerous ones.\n• Rancid food and oils are unsafe and can produce cancer. Even health foods which have been on the\nshelf (not refrigerated) for too long can be rancid. Try to make sure that the wheat germ, wheat germ\noil, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flaxseed oil, and whole wheat flour are fresh. Natural,\nunprocessed foods are extremely perishable. Refrigerate as soon as possible after purchasing them.\nWheat germ is a special problem; it turns rancid a week after it is made. Vitamins E, A, and F are\ntotally destroyed in rancid foods. During the process of turning rancid, very harmful chemicals, such as\nperoxides, are produced. Because they are strong chemical irritants, after being ingested they can cause\ncancer. Research on this was done in Germany by Dr. H. Anemueller, and, in the University of\nPennsylvania, by Drs. Rownee and Barrett.\n• Heated fats (animal or vegetable), when heated to a high temperature, become carcinogenic. Never\nfry food, never eat fried food. Instead add no oil to your cooking, but place measured amounts on your\nfood after it is served at the table. In this way, you will be better able to control your oil intake.\n• Oil in the coffee bean turns rancid when heated; do not drink coffee because of that and several other\nreasons.

It must try to produce additional enzymes to\ndetoxify that cooked food, which tries to produce a normal output of the same enzymes used throughout\nthe body to destroy cancer cells.\n• When you do cook, measure the water and keep track of the time needed to cook the food—so that\nyou will know exactly when to turn off the fire, and there is only a very small amount of water\nremaining in the pot. Then be sure and drink that water.\n• It has been reported that cancer which has been controlled, starts returning if over 25% of the food is\ncooked and processed. This is probably due to the extra demand on the pancreas to replace enzymes\ndestroyed by heat. This paragraph is worth remembering later on.\n• Cook all sprouts slightly to eliminate a certain enzyme. But do not heat alfalfa sprouts; eat them raw."},{"id":"disease-general-problem-foods","title":"Problem Foods","lang":"en","text":"• Eliminate fats, salted foods, fried foods, smoked foods, pickles, soft drinks, caffeine, alcohol,\nchocolate, and all processed, fried, and junk foods from the diet.\n• A high alcohol and/or caffeine intake is cause of breast cancer. The use of alcohol or tobacco leads to\ncancer of the larynx. Smokeless tobacco produces cancer of the lip, mouth, tongue, and throat. Smoking\ncigarettes or cigars produces lung cancer and is a factor in bladder and kidney cancer.\n• Do not eat too much salt. Research in Japan disclosed that the frequency of stomach cancer is\ndefinitely related to the quantity of salt eaten.\n• Caffeine also interferes with production of those enzymes.\n• Cancerous tumors require sugar in order to grow. Older women who use generous amounts of sugar\nare much more likely to contract breast cancer. Do not use any cane sugar products, such as cake, pie,\njelly, ice cream, candy, etc.\n• In animal studies, progressive increase in sucrose in the diet leads to a dose-dependent decline in\nantibody production.\n• An epidemiological study of 21 countries revealed that high sugar intake is a major risk factor toward\nbreast cancer.\n• Artificial sweeteners are cancer-causing drugs.\n• Do not use China tea (the regular tea you buy in the grocery store); it contains tannic acid. Only use\nherbal teas.\n• Some natural-remedy cancer therapists say never use tomatoes at all, if you have cancer. There is\nsomething about tomatoes that tend to aggravate the situation for those with active cancer.\n• Others say that those with cancer can eat tomatoes by themselves, not with other foods. Some say it is\nall right to make a meal of them if you wish—eaten alone. Some say they can be eaten with fresh-baked\nzwieback (bread which has then been toasted in the oven until it is hard and chewy). Probably the best\ndecision is avoid tomatoes entirely if you have a malignancy.\n• Do not take supplemental iron tablets. The body tries to withhold iron from cancer cells, because the\ninorganic iron helps the cancer grow. People with excess iron levels in the blood tend to have an\nincreased risk of developing cancer, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Excess iron\nsuppresses the cancer-killing function of the macrophages and interfere with T- and B-cell activity. The\nrichest source of good iron is blackstrap molasses.\n• Cancer thrives on glucose. They produce a 3- to 5-fold increase in glucose uptake compared to healthy\ncells. Studies of cancer patients revealed that they tended to eat more sugar than healthy people. It was\nalso found that high sugar intake increases the likelihood breast cancer.\n• Simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose [white sugar]) honey, and orange juice significantly\nimpaired the capacity of neutrophils to engulf bacteria, but starch ingestion did not have this effect.\nHowever, you still need simple sugars, so eat them in moderation."},{"id":"disease-general-good-foods","title":"Good Foods","lang":"en","text":"• The average Westerner eats 1,500 pounds of food per year. The food we eat is an important factor in\nhealth or degeneration. Only nutritious foods should be eaten, and in moderation.\n• Overeating is associated in 35% of all cancers.\n• One group of mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted (about 3 g per day); the other was\nrestricted to 2 g. Over half the mice on the unrestricted diet developed cancer after 90 weeks. Later\nexperiments repeated this result, producing all types of tumors (lung, liver, skin, etc.). In every\nexperiment, the more the diet is restricted in calories, the less incidence of cancerous growths.\n• Carotenoids and bioflavonoids are both free radical protectors. Both stimulate the immune system,\nwhile there is evidence that carotenoids may be directly toxic to tumor cells. Carotenoids are the yellow\ncoloring matter in green and yellow vegetables. Deep green leafy vegetables and fresh carrot juice are\nthe best sources. Bioflavonoids are found in citrus, whole grains, honey, and other plant foods.\n• Animals fed cruciferous vegetables had markedly lower cancer rates matched controls. This family of\nvegetables includes broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. Of them, broccoli has been\nfound to be the best. Since that 1970 discovery the University of Minnesota, the active ingredient, called\nindoles, have been isolated from the vegetables is provides unusual protection against cancer. Scientists\nat Johns Hopkins found that lab animals fed cruciferous vegetables, and then exposed to the deadly\ncarcinogen aflatoxin, had a 90 percent reduction in cancer rates.\n• Greens and the green foods have every known vitamin, except Vitamin D and, possibly, B12. In\naddition, they have high levels of beta-carotene, potassium, glutathione (an amino acid) and other crucial\nnutrients which reduce tumor growth.\n• A diet high in beta-carotene, especially beta-carotene, has been found to protect against cancer\n(International Journal of Cancer, September 1984).\n• Green powders, such as Greenlife, Barley Green, etc., are invaluable. Eat a spoonful with your food or\nin juice.\n• Emphasize raw food to the degree you are able to do so. It is best that most of the food be raw,\nespecially fruits and green leafy vegetables.\n• Phytosterols are natural chemicals in plants which reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n• Abscisic acid is a plant dormancy hormone and vitamin A analog found in plants; it has profound anti-\ncancer activity. Abscisic acid is a carotenoid factor and is especially found in green leafy vegetables.\n• While cleaning the body (such as during a fast), breakfast can consist of fresh fruit and fruit juices. Use\nlemon, orange, grape, carrot, beet, and apple juice daily. All juices should be fresh, with no sugar\nadded.\n• But in other foods, a small amount of blackstrap molasses, pure maple syrup, or honey can act as a\nnatural sweetener in place of sugar.\n• Use whole wheat or rye in place of white flour. Whole grain products, well-baked, are good. Do not\nuse sourdough bread, sugared bread, or fruit breads. They are too indigestible.\n• Raw fruit and vegetables are best; lightly cooked or steamed are second best. Salt-free frozen are\nnext. Then comes salt-free canned; but such food should only be used if the first three choices are not\navailable.\n• Raw fruit and vegetable juices are needed to clean the system and help rebuild it. Use red beet juice\n(from roots and very little if any from tops) and juice from carrots, celery, grapes, and other\ndarker vegetables and fruits, such as black cherries, black currants, etc.\n• Fruit juices are best taken in the morning and vegetable juices in the afternoon and evening.\n• Drink spring or steam-distilled water only!\n• Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer researcher, uses fresh raw cabbage and carrot juice with excellent results.\n• Some recommend four 8-ounce glasses of freshly squeezed juice daily. Max Gerson, M.D., prescribed\n13 glassfuls a day. Along with a scientific program of other remedies, that juice pattern is still followed\ntoday at the Gerson Institute in northern Mexico.\n• Never mix fruit and vegetable juices in the same meal. It is all right to mix vegetables juices\ntogether, but do not mix fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, or grape). Some (including\nthe Gerson Institute) recommend a combination of carrot and apple juice.\n• Fresh lemon juice should be squeezed on all greens, salads, or lettuce that are eaten. This enables the\ncalcium and minerals to be better absorbed by the system. Dark green vegetables are better than light-\ncolored lettuce.\n• Lecithin should be included in the diet to keep cholesterol in the blood stream emulsified (so it does\nnot harden on the walls). This will improve blood circulation to the site of the tumor. Lecithin helps\nregulate metabolism, break down fat and cholesterol, and prevent malignancies.\n• Wheat germ oil is an extremely rich source of vitamin E, and should be taken daily. Only use cold-\npressed (Viobin), and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to use it during the meal.\n• Omega-3 fatty acids may inhibit cancers, especially breast cancer (Cancer, October 1986). Flaxseed\noil is, by far, the best source!\n• According to a 1988 medical article (British Journal of Surgery), eating an adequate amount of\nessential fatty acids helps protect the body against skin cancer. It even helps eliminate them, once they\nform.\n• Take a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses at the end of the vegetable meal. This will provide additional\namounts of iron, calcium, and important B vitamins.\n• Never eat fruit and vegetables at the same meals. Exception: lemon juice can be squeezed over\ngreens to help you better absorb and calcium and minerals in those greens.\n• Use plenty of soaked figs, prunes and raisins.\n• Eat garlic daily. Studies done in Japan suggest that taking garlic supplements may help reduce the size\nof tumors. It has been used for medicinal purposes for 4,000 years.\n• Garlic is a faithful standby, and protects against cancer in general (Acta Unio. Intern. Contra\nCancrum, 20 no. 3, 1964). Cut a thin slice of garlic and carefully tape it over, what you consider might\nbe, a skin cancer. Try to avoid contact of the garlic on good skin. (If it does, the skin will redden and\nburn somewhat.) Russian research from back in the 1950s revealed that garlic is more powerful than\nantibiotics in destroying bacteria. It also causes moles and skin cancers to fall off.\nPut the garlic on in the morning, take it off and carefully wash the area in the evening before bedtime.\nPut on a new application. Remove it in the morning, and repeat the process. Do this for about 3 days.\nThe mole or ulcer will dissolve and slough off. Let the area heal. If part of it remains, repeat the process\nat a later time.\nIf you keep applying the garlic for more than 4 days, it will begin burning deeper into the skin (you will\nknow, because the area will become very painful.) Such deep burning is not necessary to slough off the\ncancer, and could be harmful.\n• Be sure to incorporate dietary fiber in each regular meal.\n• Fiber in the diet helps maintain regularity and avoid colon cancer. But it also helps the colon absorb\ntoxins and carry it out of the body. This is important. Be sure to eat at least 3 tablespoons of bran at each\nregular (non-juice only) meal.\n• Try to have a vegetable, fruit, and berry garden of your own, using natural fertilizers, seaweed, etc.\nYou are what you eat. Purchase food where organically-grown food is sold.\n• We do not generally think of mushrooms as the best food, for they are in the fungus family. But it has\nbeen found that three types (Reishi, Shiitake, and Maitake mushrooms) have decided anti-cancer\nfactors. Oral extract of Maitake provided complete elimination of tumors in 40% of test animals, while\nthe remaining 60% had a 90% of their cancers eliminated. Maitake contains a polysaccharide, called\nbeta-glucan, which stimulates the immune system and even lowers blood pressure.\n• Legumes and seed foods (such as soybeans) have protease inhibitors (PI). These tend to protect the\nseeds from being digested. As such, they were thought to be a problem. But recently it has been\ndiscovered that they tend to reduce tumor growth. The National Cancer Institute that some of these\nsubstances (isoflavones and phytoestrogens) have potent anti-cancer properties. However, eating a lot of\nbeans is not something you will want to do at home! Too much protein helps feed the cancer cells.\n• Certain other foods show an ability to slow tumor growth in some way. This includes apples, apricots,\nbarley, citrus fruit, cranberries, fiber, figs, ginger, spinach, and seaweed.\n• There are a variety of digestive enzymes. Take them with a meal to improve digestion, or on an empty\nstomach if the need is to help fight cancer (first thing in the morning, an hour before breakfast; or the\nlast thing at night, at least two hours after supper.)\n• Rice bran, pressure cooked, is rich in tocotrienols. (2-3 tablespoons a day).\n• Aloe vera extract (or, better, fresh aloe vera leaves) contains the active immune stimulant ace mannan.\n• Scientists have found that the active culture of bacteria in yogurt (lactobacillus) can fortify the\nimmune system. In both humans and animals, yogurt in the diet tripled the internal production of\ninterferon, a powerful chemical compound used by the immune system against cancer cells. It also slows\nthe level of natural killer cells. Yogurt slows the growth of tumor cells in the gastro-intestinal tract,\nwhile improving the ability of the immune system to destroy active tumor cells. It also helps block the\nproduction of carcinogenic agents in the colon. Women eating yogurt were found to have less breast\ncancer. It is well-known that milk is one of the worst allergenic foods, and can carry disease germs from\nthe cows. So you would do well to obtain lactobacillus cultures from health food stores, rather than\neating yogurt.\n• Other intestinal microflora products can be used, instead of yogurt (which can be allergenic and\ncontain cow diseases). Some broad spectrum products contain lactobacillus, bifidus, streptococcus\nfaecium. Others contain only lactobacillus, which is milk- and yogurt-free."},{"id":"disease-general-vitamins","title":"Vitamins","lang":"en","text":"IMPORTANT: Throughout this study, when dosage amounts used in research are given, the amounts are\nalways for \"per day\" (mg per day, etc.) G means grams, not grains.\nIMPORTANT: According to the literature surveyed, when overdosage was possible, this was indicated.\n(See vitamins A, B6, niacin, selenium, cysteine, arginine.) Of course, vitamin D overdose can also be\ntoxic, but it is not listed here as an anti-cancer factor. For a variety of reasons, beware of taking much, if\nany, iron supplements.\nIMPORTANT: Fish oils have also been recommended in the literature as possible anti-cancer agents. But\nwe do not list them here for three reasons: Large amounts must be consumed to be beneficial. Fish oil\nhas a known history of damaging the muscle of the heart. Some forms inhibit blood clotting\nTake the supplements, which seem distasteful and hard to swallow, and put them in a fruit or other drink\nand swallow them all together. If necessary, briefly whiz the mixture in a blender.\nWhen possible, chew the tablets. Break open the capsules and pour the powder onto your food or into a\nspoon. Crack liquid capsules in your mouth, and spit out the capsule. Do not crack vitamin C in your\nmouth—the acidity can hurt your teeth. Just swallow it whole.\n• It is well-known, by biochemists, that most cancer victims have a deficiency of not only all vitamins,\nbut also hydrochloric acid, potassium, magnesium, iodine, and many trace elements.\n• Vitamins are very important. Do not trust yourself to the official standardized amounts of needed\nvitamins and minerals. The actual nutritional requirements are much higher. In addition, living in our\nchemicalized, polluted age destroys a number of vitamins and minerals.\n• For example, vitamin C is destroyed in its effort to combat auto exhaust fumes and mercury in the\nfood. Vitamin E destroys itself in the process of detoxifying cadmium (which nonsmokers breath in\nwhen they are in the same room as smokers). The list goes on and on. The world is not as safe now as it\nused to be. We can be thankful that we are aware of vitamins and minerals and how to obtain them in\nsufficient quantities.\n[Special note: The following data on vitamin A was compiled from information gleaned from sources\nwhich had not yet discovered that beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) was the more active agency in cancer\nprevention, and far more powerful than vitamin A.]\n• Vitamin A is crucial in cancer therapy, but can you get too much of this oil-soluble vitamin? High\ndoses of vitamin A (500,000 IU) can have acute reversible effects. Toxicity may start as low as 25,000\nIU in those with impaired liver function (caused by drugs, hepatitis, or protein malnutrition) Otherwise,\nit begins at several hundred thousand IU.\n• Toxicity of vitamin A can be reduced by taking vitamin E at the same time. This mitigates lipid\nperoxide effects.\n• Toxicity of beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A, as found in greens and carrot juice) has never been found.\nOne 15-year study involved immense beta-carotene intake.\n• Experiment after experiment has revealed that when vitamin A is missing, cancer can be started in\nanimals; but, when it is present in abundance, not even fast growing implanted cancers will not survive\nin test animals. Vitamin A inhibits the induction and retards the growth of both malignant and non-\nmalignant tumors. Taken over a short period, vitamin A can greatly aid in recovery of cancer. Take large\ndoses (up to 150,000 units per day or you may wish to remain with smaller doses: 50,000 units, twice a\nday). Later you can reduce this to a smaller amount.\n• Take vitamin A in emulsified form to minimize liver involvement. Alternate, taking it 2 weeks on and\n1 weeks off. Blurred vision and a soapy feeling in the mouth are signs that the body has too much A.\n(Vitamin A and D, which are oil soluble, can be taken in excessive amounts, so one must always be\ncareful. Never take large amounts of either for too long a time.)\n• In some instances, a person needs to take as much as 300,000 IU of vitamin A. When this must be\ndone, taking 3200 IU of vitamin E will help reduce the risk of vitamin A toxicity.\n• Vitamin A derivatives (retinoids) reverse bronchial metaplasia.\n• Vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene reduce the risk of cancer by radiation and chemical carcinogen\nexposure. Vitamins A,D. and E inhibit oncogenes activity.\n• Varying amounts of Vitamin A were given to different patients with bladder cancer. Those receiving\nthe smallest dosages were the most likely to have recurring cancer (i.e., the cancer return later).\n• The B-complex vitamins help prevent cirrhosis of the liver. This is important because a damaged liver\nhas a 60% greater chance of becoming malignant. Dr. Max Gerson found that to be consistently true.\nTake a B-complex supplement. Also take 3-4 tablespoons of brewer's yeast each day. Do not eat\nbaker's yeast; it contains live yeast and is not good for you.\n• Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner and director of the Max Plank Institute in Berlin, declared that\nthere is a lack of one or more of three B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid) in tissue\nwhich becomes cancerous.\n• In various countries, nearly 200 scientists have reported on the importance of niacin (vitamin B3) in\npreventing and treating cancer.\n• 2 grams of Niacin (B3) daily is recommended as an anti-cancer factor.\n• Niacin has been recommended by the NIH in amounts up to 3000-6000 mg, for lowering cholesterol.\nBut time release niacin is more suspect of causing liver damage; amounts which might do this were not\ngiven.\n• Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; pyridoxal with pyridoxal-5-pyrophosphate (P5P) is helpful in reducing\ndamage from radiation therapy and slowing cancer growth from polyamine synthesis of the tumor.\nEspecially good when a B6 ointment is applied to surface melanoma tumors. It helps prevent respiratory\nand cervical cancer (Nutrition and Cancer, June 1984).\n• B6-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor susceptibility and increased tumor size. In another\nexperiment, animals fortified with B6 and then injected with melanoma (skin) cancer cells, showed a\ngreater resistance to this deadly form of cancer. Studies on humans revealed similar results.\n• Less than 500 mg of vitamin B-6 in humans appears to be safe.\n• Vitamin B12 dramatically augments the tumor kill of vitamin C.\n• A combination of folate (folic acid, a B vitamin) and B12 has been found to reverse bronchial\nmetaplasia (pre-malignant lesions). Folic acid protects against cervical cancer (American Journal of\nClinical Nutrition, January 1982).\n• Pangamic acid is vitamin B15. Many scientists (Warburg, Goldblatt, etc.) believe that chronic\noxygen deficiency in cells leads to cancer cell formation. Pangamic acid increases the body's resistance\nto oxygen deficiency. Remember that cancer cells do not use oxygen and that poorly oxygenated cells\nare the most likely to become malignant.\n• Laetrile (also called amygdalin, nitrilosides, or vitamin B17) is another substance used to eliminate\ncancer. It is derived from apricot pits (seeds). Take two 500 mg tablets of laetrile 3 times a day. It is also\nfound in all fruit kernels, except those of citrus. Other food sources, which contain lesser amounts,\ninclude lima beans, lentils, mung beans, crab apples, peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, cranberries,\nsprouted seeds, and apples (chew up the seeds as well as the apple).\n• Several apricot kernels (i.e., apricots seeds or pits) should be eaten at each protein meal. Six per day\nmay be sufficient. They should be eaten with food or, better yet, with fresh, frozen, or dried apricots.\nThe slightly bitter ones contain more laetrile (also called nitriloside or amygdalin), and are better for\nyou than are the sweet ones. Do not mix the sweet and bitter varieties; there may be an interaction. If\navailable, 100 mg of oral Amygdalin may be substituted.\n• If people regularly ate the seeds when they eat apples, peaches, apricots, they would get enough\nlaetrile. Starting to do this earlier, will help prevent cancer from forming later on.\n• But when cancer is already developing, 500-590 mg of Amygdalin, in solid tablet form, should be\nswallowed at the two larger meals. They should not be taken on an empty stomach.\n• Vitamin C is a powerful aid in resisting cancer and other diseases. Swedish studies, at Karolinska and\nUmea Hospitals, revealed that vitamin C in large doses can be an effective agent in fighting cancer.\n• Vitamin C blocks the carcinogenic effects of most poisons, including nitrates. Vitamin C can be taken\nto bowel tolerance. This means you can take as much as you can, until you begin to have diarrhea. When\nthe body tissues reach saturation on C, the remainder of this water-soluble vitamin is sent into the bowel,\nwhich reacts to the acidity by somewhat runny bowels till the C is gone. Take large doses of 5,000 mg or\nmore a day. It is the most powerful antitoxin known, and can neutralize or minimize the damaging effect\nof most chemical carcinogens entering your body from the air, water, or food.\n• Cancer of the bladder can occur when the amino acid tryptophan is not properly metabolized, resulting\nin oxidation of its metabolites. Vitamin C prevents that oxidation process, and thus blocks cancer\ndevelopment. It is a preventative agent against a variety of cancers (Journal of the National Cancer\nInstitute, 73, 1984).\n• Vitamin C is such a potent cancer fighter, that it is well to here provide additional information:\nDeficiency symptoms include slow wound healing, pain in joints, immune suppression, bleeding gums,\nirritability, and increased risk of cancer. If you take too much at a time, it will cause mild diarrhea within\n30 minutes. Intake: RDA: 60 mg. Usual U.S.: 114 mg. Prophylactic: 500-2000 mg. Therapeutic: 500-\n100,000 mg.\n• Taken in larger doses, Vitamins A and C inhibit hyaluronidase, an enzyme found in cancerous\ntissues.\n• Vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants. When accompanied by the minerals, selenium and zinc, they\nhelp protect against malignancies.\n• Low serum levels of vitamin A and E were common in patients receiving, and responding poorly to,\nchemotherapy. The great danger in using chemotherapy and radiation is the damage, introduction of a\npoisonous conditions, and destruction of anti-cancer vitamins.\n• Vitamin C and beta-carotene (pre-vitamin A) have been found to be effective in reversing cervical\ndysplasia and oral leukoplakia in humans.\n• Vitamins C and K separately showed anti-tumor activity against human cancer cells in vitro, but\nbecame synergistically effective at 2% the regular dosage when used together.\n• A substance in vitamin D, known as 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol has been discovered to be an anti-\ncancer factor. But, due to toxicity of vitamin D overdose, must be used only under the care of a\nprofessional. For most of us, it is best to avoid using too much vitamin D, although some is needed.\nSunshine is the best source. (Fish oils can cause heart trouble.)\n• Vitamin E, working with C, inhibits the activity of a growth substance (catalyst) found in cancerous\ntissue. Take up to 1,000 units a day. Vitamins C and E help the body inhibit the activity of the enzyme\nhyaluronidase, found in cancerous tissue.\n• A lack of beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamin E, and B complex in lung tissue may be related to\nlung cancer.\n• Injections of vitamin E, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin (a carotenoid) and algae extract\ndramatically bolstered levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, and reversed hamster buccal pouch tumors.\n• Human prostatic cancer cells in vitro were markedly reduced when vitamin E was added. It helps\nprotect against bowel cancer (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 73, 1984).\n• Vitamin F is the essential fatty acids. Add 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed vegetable oil to each food\nmeal (not juice-only meals). Wheat germ oil and flaxseed oil are the best. Corn oil and soy oil are\nsecond best. Safflower oil is not so good. Make sure the oil is fresh and kept refrigerated when not in\nuse. Never use cottonseed oil (it can cause blindness), hydrogenated oils, lard, greases, or animal\nproducts. The oil in the nuts is good, if the nuts are fresh.\n• Vitamin K helps protect the body against certain cancer-causing substances. Take it with vitamin C to\nincrease its cancer-reducing strength.\n• Quercetin (one of the bioflavonoids which, together, are called vitamin P) increased the cell kill rate\nin cancer cells, which were exposed to hyperthermia (heat therapy) with no negative effect on normal\nhealthy cells.\n• Quercetin reduced cancers in animals exposed to two carcinogens."},{"id":"disease-general-minerals","title":"Minerals","lang":"en","text":"• A Cancer Control Convention, meeting in Japan, reported that the trace mineral, germanium, in the\ndiet is a significant factor in preventing and eliminating cancer.\n• One cancer researcher, who studied in-depth into cancer remedies over the past 150 years, declared\nthat every effective anticancer formula (Glyoxylide, which is the Koch treatment; the Hoxsey herbs;\nHypotonic therapy; laetrile; the Gerson method; Krebiozen; and Carcalon) involves extra amounts of\npotassium. This is very important.\n• Be sure to include a significantly higher intake of potassium. Potassium deficiency is considered by\nGerson, Scott, and others as a primary contributing cause of cancer.\n• Potassium foods include almonds, apples, dried apricots, bananas, beans, beets, broccoli, carrots,\ndulse, grapes, kale, olives, pecans, rice bran, sunflower seeds, wheat bran, and germ. These foods help\nthe body resist and overcome tumors, cysts, and malignancies.\n• Center your diet around potassium foods. Here are more of them:\n• Dried apricots, asparagus, pearled barley, dried navy beans, fresh lima beans, raw beets, sprouted bread\nwith no salt, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, caraway seed, cauliflower, celery seed, small leaves\nof chard, dark raw cherries, dandelion greens, dill seed, endive, unsulphured figs (dried or raw), garlic,\nconcord or emperor grapes, grapefruit, fresh horseradish, fresh lemons, lentils, fresh limes, nectarines,\nokra, onions, oranges, fresh parsley, dried or raw peaches, Bartlett pears, dry or fresh peas, persimmons,\nraw pineapple (never canned), raw plums, dried or raw prunes, raw quinces, raisins, wild or brown rice,\nsage, rolled oats, spinach, squash (acorn, Hubbard, yellow summer), tangerines, raw tapioca, raw turnip\nleaves, and watermelon.\n• Drink potassium broths daily. Prepare them from half-inch thick potato peelings, which are then\ncooked. Draw off the water and drink it.\n• You want foods which are high in iodine and potassium, low in sodium, protein, and fat.\n• Potassium ascorbate (12-20 g) can be taken as a partial potassium supplement. This product includes\nvitamin C.\n• Potassium and magnesium are among the more crucial minerals for cancer recovery. Magnesium\nhelps to stabilize cell membranes and elevate immune activity while potassium plays a critical role in\nmembrane permeability. (Magnesium, 400-800 mg daily from aspartate, citrate, or orotate.)\n• Magnesium protects against cancer in general (Medical Hypotheses, August 1980).\n• Calcium and magnesium have a beneficial effect in helping the body resist colon cancer. Natural\niron supplements help prevent thyroid cancer. (But many iron supplements are dangerous! Take\nblackstrap molasses instead of iron pills.)\n• The New England Journal of Medicine reported that calcium may prevent precancerous cells from\nbecoming cancerous. Calcium protects against colon cancer (American Journal of Epidemiology,\nSeptember 1988).\n• Calcium supplements (2000 mg) provide a marked suppression of rectal cancer proliferation. It\ninhibits early stages of colon cancer in genetically vulnerable individuals.\n• Iodine and trace minerals are crucial. You can obtain them by each day eating some Nova Scotia\ndulse or Norwegian kelp. Both are special seaweeds which have a wide spectrum of trace minerals. Food\ngrown on the continents does not have all those trace minerals; rainwater has gradually depleted the\nsoils.\n• Iodine protects against breast cancer (Lancet, April 1976).\n• It is very important to keep the iodine level of the blood normal, so both the thyroid and body tissues\nwill have proper cell oxidation. Eat a sufficient amount of dulse, or kelp, each day. (Do not use\nCalifornia kelp.)\n• People with myxedema, or underactive thyroids, are more prone to developing cancer. So keep your\nthyroid in good condition with seaweed.\n• Japan and Iceland both have low goiter and breast cancer rates. This may be because their diets are rich\nin iodine and selenium. Breast cancer has been linked to an iodine deficiency. Japanese women have\nalmost no breast cancer. Colon cancer rates in Japan are also low.\n• Studies at the University of Zurich and in London Polytechnic revealed that brewer's or food yeast\ngives improved resistance against cancer development. Brewer's yeast is one of the best sources of\nselenium, an important anticancer mineral.\n• Selenium made the headlines, at the end of 1996, as a special trace mineral which could dramatically\nreduce cancer in the human body. It completely inhibited tumor growth in mice inoculated with tumor\ncells.\n• Selenium helps eliminate cancer in five ways: It improves detoxification, bolsters immune function,\ndirectly toxic to tumor cells, and may is a valuable anti-proliferative factor (Lancet, July 1983).\nSelenium intake should not exceed 2500 mcg (2.5 mg) per day.\n• Using selenium as a sole therapy, there was a 38.8% favorable response rate in patients with oral\ncancer.\n• High doses of selenium (equivalent to 54 mg in humans) resulted in 83-90% reduction in rate of tumor\ngrowth in mice.\n• Long-term usage of 5000 mcg of selenium may result in fingernail changes and hair loss. Selenite is\nmore toxic than selenium bound to amino acids (i.e., selenomethionine). Ingestion of 1-5 mg/kg body\nweight of selenite will produce toxic side effects. This is equivalent to 65,000 mcg in a 65 kg adult.\n• Chromium as picolinate is very helpful in working with carcinoma. (400-800 mcg.)\n• Zinc as zinc picolinate (30-100 mg) is also a significant help. It protects against prostrate cancer\n(British Journal of Urology, October 1983).\n• Cesium is neither essential nor toxic in cancer reduction.

And now, before the cancer has a chance to start, you are beginning\nwaste disposal operations. With prayer, diligent work, and the blessing of God, you can have success.\n• While some are concerned with treating symptoms, you must be concerned with getting at the causes\nof cancer and eliminating them. Only then can the problem be permanently solved.\nThe Gerson Therapy seems to do the best job of eliminating the toxins. You will find it discussed later in\nthis book.\n• Well, there you have a number of possible suggestions. What you have just read may seem like a lot of\nwork. But, since cancer will generally mean the end of you, are you sure you do not want to work?\n• It is extremely important that you care for and rebuild the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, bowels, and other\norgans. Dr. Max Gerson maintained that he could eliminate cancer in anyone if the liver was in good\ncondition. Take care of your liver.\n• If you have cancer, we recommend that you locate a physician and place yourself under his care. A\ncareful, systematic regime of healthful recovery is needed, and you may not know what to do.\nRegardless of which doctor you go to, while waiting for appointments get started doing the right things!\nDoctors may be busy, but your life depends on changes which need to start right now. Essentially\neverything, listed here in Part One of this book, you can do at home to improve health and help prevent\nmalignancies.\n• Do not fear. Trust your life to God; obey the Ten Commandments by faith in Christ; and step forward,\nliving your best and doing your best. Entrust the outcome to God.\n• America alone spends $800 billion yearly on physicians and hospitals; yet it is 23rd in the world in\nlevel of health, vitality, and longevity.

Go to\nbed, take juices and light meals, rest, and get well. When suppressed, the phlegm does not\nflow out, but hardens in the sinuses and trouble begins.\n• Take a short fast on citrus juices, vegetable juices, and herb teas. Drink lots of water and\njuices.\n• As soon as you are able, begin eating nourishing food, especially vegetables, fruits, nuts,\nand beans. Drink fresh carrot juice every day.\n• Eliminate meat, dairy products, white flour foods, and sugar.\n• Do not use nose drops; they aggravate the situation by stopping the drainage and\nhardening the mucous. Decongestants also increase blood pressure.\n• Hot liquids help the sinuses flow out their contents.\n• Helpful herbs to reduce sinus congestion would include comfrey, slippery elm,\nfenugreek, mullein, aloe vera, yerba santa, red clover, and white oak bark.\n• Garlic contains a chemical which makes mucous less sticky. Horseradish has it also.\nCayenne acts in a somewhat similar manner. Peppermint tea also helps open up the sinus\npassageways.\n• Add crushed garlic cloves to 4 cups water; remove from the heat after coming to a boil.\nCool and gradually drink. This will help clean out the sinuses and lower stuffiness.\n• Heat on the sinuses helps relieve pain. This can be hot wet compresses, a heat lamp, a 60-\nwatt light bulb, or a heating pad.\n• A variation of this is: Twice a day, lean over a pan of hot water with a towel draped over\nyour head (or stand in a hot shower). Inhale the vapors as they waft up toward your nose.\nIf you are at work, order a cup of something hot; and, leaning over, sniff up the moisture.\n• Some prefer cold applications to the sinuses, instead of hot ones. Put crushed ice in a\nplastic sack, wrap in a moist towel, and place over the sinus which hurts. At the same\ntime, have the feet in hot water. This will help draw blood from the sinus area. However,\nthe hot method is better for draining the sinuses.\n• Mix 1 tsp. of salt with 2 cups warm water. Pour it into a small glass; and, holding back\nyour head, sniff it up into one nostril (as you pinch the other one closed). Repeat for the\nother side.\n• Rubbing your sore sinuses brings a fresh supply of blood to the area. Press your thumbs\nfirmly on either side of your nose and hold for 15-30 seconds.\n• Sit with your head between your knees. Cough gently as though you were clearing your\nthroat. Then hold your breath for a minute or so, as the mucous slowly drains. Then gently\ninhale. Be sure you are drinking enough fluids when you do this.\n• Walking helps clear your sinuses.\n• Between meals every day, take six charcoal tablets with water. This will help remove\ntoxins. Only do this during the crisis, or it can cause temporary constipation.\n• It is better to sniffle than to blow your nose. If you must blow, only blow lightly and\nthrough one nostril at a time.\n• A humidifier will help keep sinuses moist indoors during the winter months. A humidity\nof 40-50% will increase sinus comfort.\n• Avoid cold, damp living, working, and sleeping quarters.\n(Sinus Trouble)\n\nCauses\n\nThe nasal sinuses are located in the bones surrounding the eyes and nose. They help your\nvoice sound fuller and richer. They also help store overflow phlegm in time of illness.\nSinusitis is an inflammation of the nasal sinuses that generally occurs together with upper respiratory\ninfection. Colds or bacterial and viral infections spread into the sinuses.\nSinus problems which have become chronic may be caused by injury of the nasal bones, smoking, small\ngrowths in the nose, or irritant fumes and odors.\nAllergenic sinusitis may result from plant pollens (hay fever) or allergies to milk; dairy products; or, less\nlikely, wheat.\nAn over-acid condition in the stomach can cause sinus troubles. Poor digestion of starch, sugar, and\ndairy products can produce a runny nose. When force is used in blowing the nose, phlegm is pushed up\ninto the sinuses.\nSwimming or diving can force phlegm up into the sinuses.\nAllergic rhinitis is a common cause of sinusitis. Avoid substances which might be giving you allergies.\nDecayed teeth, enlarged and infected adenoids, cigarette smoke, perfume, household cleansers, and\ndusty air can cause irritation to the sinuses.\nSo sinus trouble can either be caused by an infection or by other things. If drainage is clear after a week,\nyou probably have no infection; but, if mucous is greenish or yellowish, you do. If drainage is clear and\nthere are no accompanying symptoms of a common cold, you probably have an allergy.\nFew people with sinus trouble have actual sinus infection (sinusitis).\nBeware of swelling around the eyes! If left untreated, this can lead to bronchitis, asthma, throat\ninfection, or pneumonia.\nIf you are interested in figuring out which sinuses may be bothering you, here is some helpful data:\nFrontal sinuses produce frontal headaches which are most severe between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\nMaxillary sinuses makes pain in the upper teeth and cheek, and sometimes eye pain as well. It generally\nlasts from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.\nEthmoid sinuses induce a dull pain behind the eyes, pain in eye movements, tearing, light sensitivity,\nand occasionally sore throat and nighttime cough.\n\nSymptoms\n\nOne or more of the following symptoms: facial pain, tenderness on the cheekbones,\nface and forehead, earache, headache, dry cough, bad breath, fever, dazed feeling in the head, loss of\nsmell, and burning and tearing eyes. Sometimes it results in a swollen face, stuffy nose, and a thick\nmucous discharge."},{"id":"disease-head-eye-problems","title":"Eye Problems","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Certain eye problems need specialized attention.

Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nNOTE—This section deals with methods of reducing blood congestion in the middle ear and inner ear,\nand was taken, with slight adaptation, from Dr. William L. McKie's book, Scientific Hydrotherapy, page\n55.\nDRAINING THE MIDDLE EAR—Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and\nface, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the Hot Compress\nextends below the jaw, the common carotid will be dilated (enlarged), which you do not want. An Ice\nBag should be placed below the jaw at the same time. This will increase the effect, by contracting the\ncarotid.\nDRAINING THE INNER EAR—The internal ear, receiving its blood supply from the vertebral artery,\na branch of the subclavian, is not affected by heat over the ear. But the inner ear problem may be\nrelieved, when congested, by warm applications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back\nof the neck, thus diverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or\nan ice bag to the back of the neck.\n—Also see \"Earache and Infection.\"\nEARACHE and INFECTION; MASTOIDITIS\n(Otitis Externa and Media)\n\nCauses\n\nInfection of the outer or middle ear causes pressure to build up. This pressure on nerve\nendings causes pain. But, if there were no pain, there might be no warning that a serious ear problem\nexisted.\nOtitis externa is infection in the outer ear. The eardrum through the length of the eustachian tube\nbecomes swollen and inflamed. There is a slight fever, discharge from the ear, pain (which increases\nwhen the ear is touched or pulled), and temporary loss of hearing.\nOtitis media is infection in the middle ear, and is especially common in infants and children. The\ninfection is located behind the eardrum, where the small ear bones are located. There is earache,\nfullness, pressure in the ear, and a fever as high as 103o F. or higher.\nHere is an ear test: if you can wiggle your outer ear (the part you can see) without pain, you probably\nhave a middle ear infection; if there is pain, the infection is in the eustachian tube.\nGoing into higher altitudes can push phlegm, already in the eustachian tube, into the middle ear. Never\nsleep on your ear if you have a head cold and the vehicle is moving upward to a higher elevation.\nInfection in the inner ear generally results from meningitis or from the spread of a middle-ear infection.\nSymptoms include loss of hearing, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and fever.\nEarache is a common childhood infection. Most children experience it. It is easier for a child to have an\near infection, since his eustachian tube is shorter than that of an adult. Causes include childhood\ndiseases, allergies, colds, and respiratory infections.\nIf they are frequent, ear infections can lead to loss of hearing.\nChronically enlarged adenoids may cause blockage of the eustachian tubes, leading to congestion and\nfluid buildup in the middle ear.\nThere is a tendency for people who have ear problems to be heavy earwax producers. To reduce the\namount of earwax made, eat less unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are not a problem.\nTREATMENT FOR INFECTION—\n• If you seem to have pain in the ear, pull on the earlobe. If the pain increases, then you\nprobably have an ear infection. If the pain does not increase, you may have a dental\nproblem.\n• Keep the ears warm and the person resting in bed, preferably with his head and, perhaps\nalso, his trunk slightly elevated (to assist natural drainage of the eustachian tubes).\nSurgical draining might be necessary. The fever increases the need for vitamins A and C.\nKeep the feet warm. Heat applied to the feet will draw blood from the head and improve\ncirculation.\n• Sit up when practical to do so, to decrease the swelling and start the tubes draining.\nSwallowing will help ease the pain. Yawning really helps open up the eustachian tubes.\n• Blow warm air from a hair dryer 18-30 inches from the ear, and blow air toward it.\n• Warm some oil to body temperature, and place a drop or two in the ear. This will help\nlessen pain. But do not do this if you think the drum has burst!\n• A helpful method, used by many for a long time is this: To alleviate pain in the ear, use a\nlittle olive oil or garlic oil in the ear, then add a drop or two of lobelia tincture.\n• Another way to reduce pain is to make a paste, using onion powder or clay packs. Then\napply this to the outside of the ear.\n• Bake a large onion until it becomes soft, and tie it over the ear; this will often give great\nrelief when pain is severe.\n• Avoid sugar, dairy products, meat, and heavy meals until the crisis is past. Herbal teas\nare helpful in assisting the healing process. This includes peppermint, echinacea,\ngoldenseal, pau d'arco, and slippery elm.\n• Because they increase sticky mucous in the body, dairy products increase ear infections.\nExcessive sweets and starches lower resistance and intensify ear problems.\n• People with a tendency to ear infection should avoid all cow's milk products. But, in\naddition to producing so much mucous, it is reported that milk allergies can produce\nearaches (and even a burst eardrum), simulating otitis media—without an ear infection\nactually existing.\n• Avoid cigarette smoke, for it can irritate the eardrum.\n• Place drops of hydrogen peroxide in the ear, to help clean it out. Then rinse out with\nwater. Do not leave the peroxide there. It can sink through the eardrum and produce a\nfizzing sound which can last for several years.\n• Take garlic enemas. These will help disinfect the body of higher levels of toxins that are\nbuilding up from the infection. Signs of this are chills, fever, general aches, and pain\nincrease.\nTREATMENT FOR RUPTURE—\nWhat should you do if the eardrum ruptures? Causes include a severe ear infection, sudden pressure\ninward on the ear, resulting from diving, slapping, a strong kiss to the ear, or a nearby explosion.\nDuring an ear infection, pus builds up and causes pain in the ear. If this pus starts leaking to the outside,\nthen the eardrum has ruptured.\n• In case the eardrum ruptures, put nothing in the ear until the eardrum is healed. A\nfomentation on the outside of the ear can be helpful.\n• Once the infection increases to acute pain, you may need antibiotics.\n• An alternate method is: When the ear has abscessed and broken, use warm peroxide to\nwash the ear out. The peroxide will loosen the putrefied matter and bring it out of the ear.\nThis method is probably good for cleaning out the ear; but keep in mind that hydrogen\nperoxide is best used on outside body surfaces, where oxygen can cause it to fizz into\nharmlessness. When it gets inside sensitive body parts, it can continue there for quite\nsome time. We know of one individual who had peroxide in his ear for several years\nthereafter; and, every so often, he could hear it lightly fizzing.\n• When using water therapy on the ear, be guarded. Hot applications over the area under\nthe ear could cause trouble!\n- Also see \"Swimmer's Ear.\"\nHYDRO—Here are hydrotherapy treatments mentioned in the author's book, Water Therapy Manual\n(see order sheet):\nIrrigation of the Ear: A lean rubber tube is used to gently (gently!) introduce a flow of\nwater onto the outer ear. The water is never applied with any pressure! It flows to the ear\nand out to the side. The temperature may be from 100o to 120o F., depending upon the\neffect desired. The source of water should be on a level with the top of the head (to\nmaintain only a slight pressure). Never use force, because perforation of the ear often\nexists; and serious injury could result from introduction of water, with any degree of\nforce, into the middle ear. The head should be inclined to the side as the water is applied.\nThe canal of the ear should afterward be carefully dried and covered with a cloth or a\nwarm hand for a few minutes. In cold weather, the ear should not be exposed out-of-doors\nfor at least an hour after warm ear irrigation is applied; and, even after that, a small piece\nof cotton should be placed in the outer passageway.\nThis measure affords great relief in the pain of acute otitis media and earache due to other\ncauses. In chronic suppurative disease of the ear, this measure is indispensable as a means\nof cleansing and disinfection (p. 151).\nDraining the middle ear: Applications should be made to the whole side of the head and\nface, diverting blood from the internal carotid and internal maxillary blood vessels. If the\nHot Compress extends below the jaw, the common carotid artery will be dilated\n(enlarged), which you do not want. An ice bag should be placed below the jaw at the same\ntime, and will increase the effect by contracting the carotid.\nDraining the inner ear: The inner ear problem may be relieved, when congested, by warm\napplications to the arms and cold applications to the head and back of the neck, thus\ndiverting the blood into the arms from the vertebral arteries by a proximal compress or an\nice bag to the back of the neck (p. 194).\nInflammation of ear: Fomentation over affected part; derivative treatment to legs: Hot Leg\nBath, Hot Foot Bath, Prolonged Leg Pack (p. 210).\nInflammation of middle ear: Ice to throat of the same side, Fomentation over ear (p. 221).\nEarache: Ice Bag to the neck of the same side; Fomentation over ear; Hot Ear Douche, if\nnecessary. Protect the ear with warm cotton, to prevent chilling by evaporation after\ntreatment (p. 224).\nEustachian tube inflammation: The Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold\ncloth, covered with flannel, which then heats up and results in improved circulation and a\nbetter flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted area. Wring the cotton cloth\nfrom cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3 thicknesses about\nthe neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit the\nflannel snugly but not too tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it\nthe next morning. It should be entirely dry. In eustachian tube inflammation, the compress\nshould extend upward about the lower part of the ear. You may need to hold up this part\nof the compress (the part by the lower part of the ear) with a bandage that is fastened to it\nand goes over the top part of the head and back down to it on the other side (pp. 51-53).\nPREVENTION—\n• Never dive below 3-4 feet below the surface of the water.\n• Never sleep in a plane or vehicle when it is descending—or ascending. If you are in a\ncar, climbing up or down the mountains—do not sleep, especially on your side. You do\nnot swallow as often when you are asleep; and, if you have phlegm in your sinuses, it can\ngo up into your ears.\n• Be careful when scuba diving. The greatest air pressure changes occur within the first 33\nfeet below the surface. Avoid earplugs and hoods which are too tight-fitting, so you\ncannot equalize air pressure in the ears.\n• Avoid the above three situations, when your head is stuffy with phlegm.\n• Breast-feeding reduces a baby's chances of having ear trouble.\n• Do not smoke.\n—Also see \"Ear Congestion.\"\n\nSymptoms\n\nOne or both ears ache. This is frequently accompanied by infection in the middle ear.\nThe pain will be worse at night because the body is prone (flat) and it is more difficult for the eustachian\ntubes to drain out the phlegm.\nSometimes the ears will ache because there is trouble with the teeth (referred pain), but this is not\ncommon."},{"id":"disease-head-earwax","title":"Earwax","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Never put anything sharp in the ear! That includes bobby pins, paper clips, and pencil\ntips. They can puncture the eardrum.\n• Do not use cotton-tipped swabs either, because they merely ram the wax down deeper\nand impact it the more.\n• Place something in your ear which will soften it. This can be hydrogen peroxide, mineral\noil, or glycerin. Add a drop or two of this to each ear. Let the excess run out. The liquid\nleft inside will soften the wax. Do this for a couple days.\n• Fill a bowl with body-temperature water. Suck it into a rubber bulb syringe; and, holding\nyour head over the bowl, gently squirt the water into the ear. Use very, very little pressure.\nTurn your head and let the water run out.\n• Do not rub the ears, to dry them. Either use a hair dryer (18-20 inches away) or drop a\nlittle alcohol in each ear. Do not wash out the ears in this manner more often than every\ncouple months. You need some earwax to protect your ears.\n• There is a tendency for people who have ear problems to be heavy earwax producers. To\nreduce the amount of earwax made, eat less unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty\nacids are not a problem. It is the over-balance of unsaturated fats which causes the earwax\nproblem.\n• An alternate method of cleaning out the earwax is this: Using an eyedropper, place either\na solution of 1 part vinegar to 1 part warm water or a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in\nyour ear. Allow it to settle for a minute, then drain it. Do this 2-3 times a day. If the wax is\nhard and dry, apply garlic oil for a day or two, to soften it. Then wash out the ear with a\nsteady stream of warm water, under no pressure. Patiently continue irrigating the ear\ncanal, flushing with warm water. The wax buildup will come out.\n• Yet another method is using \"ear candles,\" available at health food stores. Someone will\nhave to help you use them. Instructions come with the candles. Afterward, you may be\nbothered by the fact that an excess of wax has been eliminated. You may need to put\ncotton in each ear for a time.\n\nCauses\n\nThe problem may a hard plug of earwax in the ear canal. Some people have constant ear\npain until the excess wax is cleaned out.\nIf you do not chew your food thoroughly, earwax can build up. The chewing tends to break it down.\nSaturated fats contribute to excess production of earwax.\n\nSymptoms\n\nHearing is becoming duller, and the person suspects he may be losing his hearing."},{"id":"disease-head-swimmer-s-ear","title":"Swimmer'S Ear","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Hydrogen peroxide ear drops.\nSee \"Earache and Infection\" for additional help.\n\nCauses\n\nSwimmer's ear occurs when pool water remains in the outer ear canal too long. Bacteria or\nfungi in the water increases the chance of infection. When swimming in contaminated water, keep your\nhead out of the water.\nThe pool water, having repeatedly wet and softened the earwax, caused it to become an ideal place for\nbacteria to grow.\nBut the most common cause is infection from the nasal passages and throat, having been pushed into the\neustachian tube when the nose was blown too hard.\nConstant swimming throughout the summer can result in infestation of the external ear canal by candida\nalbicans. Constant dampness (in water that is not entirely clean) throughout the summer swimming\nseason is thought to be the cause.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAn ache and/or infection in one or both ears, after swimming in a pond, creek, or public\nswimming pool."},{"id":"disease-head-hearing-loss","title":"Hearing Loss","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Consider the above factors.\n• Clean the ears, make sure manganese and tin are in the diet (take Nova Scotia dulse or\nNorwegian kelp). Take pulse tests and gradually eliminate food allergies. If milk is the\nproblem, cut out all milk products from the diet. Avoid medicinal drugs, chemicals, and\nloud noises\n• Eat a wholesome, nutritious diet, with vitamin/mineral supplements. Drink fresh\nvegetable juices.\n• Eliminate processed, sugared, and junk foods from the diet.\n• In case there is an inflammation in the ear which causes the hearing loss: Mullein oil\ncan be put in the ear as ear drops. 2-4 drops of warm (not hot) garlic oil or liquid extract is\nalso good. Do not use the same dropper in both ears, as it may spread the infection. Eat\nfresh pineapple.\n• If you seem to have pain in the ear, pull on the earlobe. If the pain increases, then you\nprobably have an ear infection. If the pain does not increase, you may have a dental\nproblem.\nPREVENTION—Always wear ear protection when using appliances or equipment which produce loud\nnoises. This would include power tools, chain saws, lawn mowers, table or portable saws, and target\npractice. Use ear plugs rated for at least twice as many decibels as you need, to ensure protection.\nWhen listening to music, it should never be so loud you cannot hear the ring of the doorbell or the\ntelephone. If you use earphones, no one else should be able to hear sound from your earphones. If they\ncan, you are playing the music too loud for the safety of your ears!\nThe average rock concert or stereo headset at higher levels (100 decibels, plus) can damage your hearing\nin 30 minutes. Two hours in a video game arcade can do the same thing. By comparison, an air hammer\nis 120 decibels.\nWear ear plugs when swimming in public places.\nReduce your cholesterol level. Those with high cholesterol have greater hearing loss as they age.\nDo not get German measles while you are pregnant. If you are vaccinated for it, do not become pregnant\nfor 3 months afterward. The ensuing birth defects to the child could include hearing loss.\nBeware of medications during pregnancy.\nMake sure your infant has good hearing. If not discovered, he or she will miss much instruction in a\nvariety of speaking skills. Generally, you will be the first one to learn if such a problem exists, not the\ndoctor.\n\nCauses\n\nIt may be that the sense of hearing is being lost. But it also may be that the ear has too much\nimpacted earwax. (See \"Earwax\" for how to remove it.)\nA manganese or tin deficiency in the diet can result in a hearing loss. Putting these back into the diet can\nreverse this, and restore the hearing.\nOther possible causes would include: Milk allergies, poor ear circulation, and vitamin A deficiency.\nThe ear drums might be hardened with age. This generally accompanies hardening of the arteries.\nCatarrhal deafness could be the problem. This starts when an acute infection (such as a cold or the flu) is\nsuppressed and not allowed to run its course and be properly eliminated. A low level infection continues\nin the ear, and gradually ruins the hearing.\nWhen acute diseases are treated with aspirin or quinine, partial or complete deafness can result. Other\ndrugs which cause this effect are aureomycin, streptomycin, barbiturates, cocaine, opium, and their\nderivatives.\nSmoking and caffeine cause spasms and narrowing of blood vessels.\nOther substances to avoid would include lead, mercury, and cadmium.\nExcessive amounts of noise injures the fine structures in the inner ear and gradually produces deafness.\nSome people have occupational hazards which eventually lead to deafness. This includes piloting small\nplanes and running chain saws or heavy equipment.\n\nSymptoms\n\nOne's sense of hearing is lessening."},{"id":"disease-head-sore-throat","title":"Sore Throat","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Sip liquid vitamin C. Let it drip down the throat slowly (all the while trying to keep the\nacid C off the teeth, so it will not melt them). Coat the throat with raw honey mixed with\nlemon juice. Gargle with salty water (½ tsp. sea salt in a cup of water).\n• Drink plenty of fluids—fruit and vegetable juices and lots of water. Go to bed, rest, trust\nin God, and get well.\n• Use a mixture of raw honey and lemon juice, to coat and soothe the throat.\n• Gargle alternately with chlorophyll liquid and sea salt (one half tsp. in a glass of warm\nwater) every few hours.\n• Enemas are very helpful.\n• Herbs include eucalyptus, flaxseed, garden sage, German chamomile, and myrtle. Both\ngoldenseal and echinacea fight bacterial and viral infection. (But do not take goldenseal\nover a week at a time, or during pregnancy.) Gargling with fenugreek tea will help relieve\na sore throat. Marshmallow root tea soothes a scratchy, itchy throat. Hot mullein poultices\nsoothe sore throats.\n• An old herb doctor makes these suggestions: Gargle the throat with cayenne pepper tea,\na half tsp. to a cup. Put an onion poultice on the neck over night, for 2-3 nights. Rub\nkerosene on the outside of the neck and cover it with warm flannel.\nHYDRO—The following is from the author's Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet):\nThe Heating Throat Compress is an application of a cold cloth, covered with flannel, which then heats\nup and results in improved circulation and a better flow of healing blood into, and out of, the afflicted\narea. Wring the cotton cloth from cold water and place it around the neck. This should be about 2-3\nthicknesses about the neck. Cover it well with flannel (singly or doubly, depending on the thickness). Fit\nthe flannel snugly but not so tightly that it will be uncomfortable. Pin it securely. Remove it the next\nmorning. It should be entirely dry (pp. 51-53).\nGive a Hot Foot Bath (p. 116).\nA Steam Bath is very helpful (pp. 131-135).\n\nCauses\n\nA variety of bacterial or virus infections can cause sore throat. Those which are of\nStreptococcus Group A origin tend to produce a higher fever than viral sources (upper respiratory\ninfections, cold viruses, flu, etc.).\nAnything irritating to the throat can initiate the problem (such as chronic coughing and loud talking).\nOther irritants include smoke, dust, fumes, very hot foods or drinks, abrasions, tooth and gum infections,\nloud talking, or chronic coughing.\nSmoking is a major cause of sore throats.\nBacteria on toothbrushes can cause sore throats. Buy a new toothbrush or boil the old one at least once a\nmonth. Between uses, store the toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide—but rinse it well before using.\nIf a sore throat continues or recurs, it might be the onset of mononucleosis (especially if the sore throat\nlasts more than 2 weeks). Do not dally; go to bed and get well. A sore throat can be the first sign of\nsomething more serious: a cold; the flu; mononucleosis; herpes simplex; Epstein-Barr virus; or several\nchildhood diseases, such as chickenpox or the measles. Sometimes a sore throat can lead to chronic\nfatigue syndrome, gingivitis, epiglottitis, diphtheria, laryngeal cancer, or an abscess around the tonsils.\nA continual throat tickle could be an indication of a food allergy.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe throat becomes sore and scratchy. This is often the first sign of an infection."},{"id":"disease-head-tooth-decay","title":"Tooth Decay","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Do not drink cola drinks. Do not eat sticky foods. Do not eat white sugar products.\n• Rinse out your mouth after eating or finish a fruit meal by eating an apple.\n• Goldenseal extract, that is alcohol-free, can be used as a antibacterial mouthwash.\n• To reduce infection in a tooth, put a few drops of goldenseal extract on a piece of cotton\nand apply it to the swollen area at night. For 3 consecutive nights, do this.\n• Eat plenty of raw fruits and vegetables.\n• Do not chew up vitamin C tablets! The acid in them will melt your teeth.\n• Avoid all toothpastes and powders. Detergents in them are harmful to teeth and gums.\n• It is vital that you take calcium supplement, in order to maintain good tooth and bone\nstructure. As you get older, you need even more calcium.\n• Massage gums with your finger once a day.\nTO STOP A TOOTHACHE—Until you can see a dentist, here are several suggestions:\n• Swish warm salt water in your mouth, and spit it out. Do this after every meal and before\nretiring at night. Stir 1 tsp. of salt into a glassful of water, at body temperature.\n• Somewhat warm salt water, held in the mouth will bring relief.\n• Apply 1-2 drops of oil of cloves to the affected tooth with a cotton swab. If the oil seems\ntoo strong, dilute it with olive oil.\n• Rinse your mouth vigorously with a mouthful of lukewarm water. If the pain is from\nfood caught between the teeth, this may flush it out.\n• Try flossing gently between the teeth.\n• Put a charcoal tablet in your mouth and, with your tongue or cheek, press it against the\nswollen gum at the base of the problem tooth.\n• Drink 1-2 cups of mullein tea or chew catnip herb.\n• Mash up the root of plantain and put it on the cheek near the tooth.\n• With your fingers rub an ice cube until one side is shaped into a V-shape. Then press it\ngently against the tender place, and push it back and forth over the area for 5-7 minutes.\nThe effect of rubbing tends to cancel out the pain signal, which must travel along the same\nnerve route.\n• Keep heat away from the tooth and nearby cheek. If it is an infection, the heat will draw\nthe infection to the outside of the jaw and make the situation worse.\n• Put ice on the nearby cheek for 15 minutes, 3-4 times a day.\n• Avoid biting on that area of the teeth.\n• Some individuals have found that, when a toothache begins, they quickly skip a meal,\nrest, take vitamin C, and conduct themselves very carefully over the next several\ndays—and the infection in the tooth is overcome by the body.\nDENTAL FILLINGS—Many books have been written on this subject in recent years. When you go to\nthe dentist, he drills out the decayed part, and then fills the cavity with something hard which, hopefully,\nwill last awhile.\nThe most common substance used for this filling is amalgam. This is a mixture of several metals, of\nwhich about 50% is always an extremely toxic chemical, called mercury. Mercury tends to evaporate\nslowly over a period of time. This influx of mercury, swallowed with your food day after day, is not the\nbest for your health.\nAlternatives are ceramic-based materials, gold, or platinum-type metals. They are more expensive, but\nless harmful. They do not gradually melt away, as does mercury in amalgam.\nFLUORIDE TREATMENTS—Even more books have been written about fluoride! This deadly poison\nshould be avoided at all costs. If it is added to your public drinking water supply, then you should buy\nbottled water (or buy a home distiller, to process your faucet water). If your dentist offers to give you\nfluoride treatments, you would do well to politely decline the opportunity.\nAIR ABRASION TECHNOLOGY—Air abrasion dental work is the latest hi-tech method of drilling\nteeth. It is said to painlessly remove tooth decay without drilling; it permits dentists to make smaller\nfillings and save a large percentage of the tooth. In addition, it does not require pain-killing anesthetics.\n(Dental Caries; Toothache)\n\nCauses\n\nThe outer part of the tooth (the very hard enamel) erodes, and then the body of the tooth\nbeneath it (the dentin) begins eroding also. This is called tooth decay.\nIt is thought that plaque buildup (a sticky mass on the surface of the tooth) provides a place for bacteria\nto grow and feed on sugars in the mouth. The acid they produce digs holes in the teeth. If not stopped,\nthe erosion enters the lower, center part of the tooth, called the pulp, where the nerve is. Then the pain\nbegins. We call it a toothache.\nHowever, certain things help produce tooth decay. These include sugary foods, sticky foods, and acid\nfoods.\nCola drinks do an excellent job of melting teeth. Coca Cola, and similar cola beverages, contain\nphosphoric acid and lots of sugar. Frankly, the fluid is so terribly acid that it would be intolerable\nwithout lots of sugar to mask the acidity. Acid, sugar, and phosphorous are very dangerous when\ncombined. The powerful acid melts part of the teeth, and the phosphorous chemically locks with the\nmelted calcium, and quickly carries it off. All that sugar does its part to ruin the teeth also. It helps the\nbacteria to jump in and start still more trouble. Drop a tooth into a glass of Coke; then time the number\nof hours before the tooth totally disappears.\n\nSymptoms\n\nA cavity or hole develops in a tooth, but may not be noticed until it begins to be\npainful."},{"id":"disease-head-heartburn","title":"Heartburn","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Immediately drink a large glass of water. This will help wash the HCl back down and\ndilute it as well.\n• Drink some raw potato juice. Whiz up an unpeeled potato and drink it down.\n• Do not lie down. Remain upright, so gravity can help push the HCl down and keep it\ndown. Later, when you do lie down, elevate the bed at the head by 4 inches.\n• Avoid bending over; if you must lift something, bend at the knees. You do not want to\ncompress your stomach when you have heartburn.\n• Eating mints relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, so HCl can crowd up into the\nesophagus.\n• Do not drink anything caffeinated, for it will irritate the esophagus even more. Caffeine\nrelaxes the sphincter, so stomach contents can move on up. Tobacco smoke also relaxes\nthe sphincter. Estrogens relax it also.\n• Drinking milk may feel good going down, but it encourages the stomach to secrete more\nacid.\n• Drinks with fizz in them expand the stomach and make it more likely that HCl will come\nup the food pipe.\n• Greasy, fried, and fatty foods sit in the stomach for a long time and increase HCl\nproduction. Avoid meat and dairy products.\n• Antidepressants and sedatives aggravate heartburn. Aspirin and ibuprofen cause\nheartburn.\n• Antacids only mask the symptoms. They also contain aluminum.\n• Avoid stress, for that increases HCl production also.\n• Loosen your belt; better yet, wear suspenders.\n• Do not eat within 2½ hours before bedtime. Doing so not only can cause heartburn, but\nbring on heart attacks also.\n• Eat more raw vegetables, chew your food well, and eat slowly.\n• Angina and heart attack are both very dangerous conditions (which see). Among the\nearliest symptoms is, what appears to be, an \"acid stomach.\" Beware. You are wise to eat\nso that you do not have heartburn. Then if major heart trouble sends a warning message\nthat seems like heartburn, you will be less likely to sit back and take some aluminum,\nfrom the drugstore, for \"antacid.\" Aluminum is a cause of Alzheimer's disease (which\nsee).\n(Acidosis, Overacid Stomach)\n\nCauses\n\nHeartburn is a sense of burning in the stomach. In most instances, some of the stomach\ndigestive juices have backed up out of the stomach into the esophagus (the food tube between the mouth\nand the stomach). This backing-up action is called reflux. These juices include hydrochloric acid, which\nis a rather powerful acid. It is used in industry, to clean metal. When it comes in contact with the\nesophagus, it burns the wall. Normally, the esophageal sphincter muscle shuts and prevents stomach\nacids from pushing upward.\nHeartburn can be caused by excessive consumption of fatty or fried foods, alcohol, coffee, spicy foods,\nchocolate, or just having too much food in the stomach. Citrus fruits or tomato-based foods cause it in a\nfew people.\nOther contributing factors are hiatal hernia, allergies, stress, gallbladder problems, and enzyme\ndeficiencies.\n\nSymptoms\n\nA burning sensation in the stomach or chest."},{"id":"disease-head-reye-s-syndrome","title":"Reye'S Syndrome","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• It would be well for the child to be given vitamin C (5-10 gms per day), intravenously;\nvitamins B-complex and B , and selenium (250-500 mcg per day) intramuscularly.\n12\n• If, in the hospital, the child receives an IV solution of glucose and electrolytes (mineral\nsalts) within 12-24 hours after the heavy vomiting begins, his chances of recovery are very\ngood.\n• Never give a child or youth aspirin after a fever.

They accept what has to be, change whatever they can\nchange, and, with God's help, keep cheerfully on their way, helping others as they go.\n• Still other researchers have found other aspects of this Type C (cancer-prone) personality.\nThe main aspect they have noted is loss, either loss of a loved one, or loss of hope. Many cancer patients\nfeel a profound sense of helplessness and despair, particularly about the meaning of their existence.\nFrequently, they need peace with God.\n• A second characteristic is the suppression or repression, of emotions.\n• The third factor is loneliness. Such people tend not to have close friends. (H. Dreher, Your Defense\nAgainst Cancer, 1988, 246-247.)\n• All three factors could be nicely resolved if such individuals would come to God and find in Him the\nencouragement, the forgiveness, and strength they need to meet life's difficulties."},{"id":"disease-musculoskeletal-fracture","title":"Fracture","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Obtain a nourishing diet. (See \"Bones, Strengthening,\" just below.)\n• Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme which acts to reduce swelling and\ninflammation. Eat half a fresh (not canned or processed) pineapple daily, until the fracture\nheals. Canned pineapple or pineapple juice may contain aluminum salts, pulled by the acid\nfrom the can by the very acid liquid.\n• During healing, the diet should include enough calories in order to provide the energy\nnecessary for new bone-cell formation.\n• You may use clay poultices to alleviate bruising and swelling.\n• Helpful herbs include comfrey and alfalfa. Also helpful are plantain and mistletoe.\n• Also place comfrey over the site of the fracture, to speed healing and reduce pain and\nswelling.\n• Too much calcium supplementation, during bone healing, can induce kidney stone\nformation during the immobile period while the cast is on. The problem is that the person\nis not active enough at that time.\n—For detailed information on rebuilding the bones, see \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\n(Broken Bone)\n\nCauses\n\nA fracture is a crack or break in a bone. If the skin over the bone remains intact, it is a\nclosed or simple fracture; if the bone breaks the skin, it is a compound fracture.\nAccidents are not a common cause of broken bones, but the bone can also be weakened from\nosteoporosis, bone tumors, or metabolic disease. A weakened bone can break much more easily—even\nfrom a slip of the foot, a slight fall, or knocking against something.\nMalnutrition can also be involved. There can be a deficiency of calcium and/or magnesium, or there may\nbe an improper calcium/phosphorous ratio.\nA vibrating tuning fork can be placed against the area; if it causes pain, there is a fracture. X rays will\nconfirm whether it is a fracture or strain or sprain.\nIt is important that the bone be properly set, so it will not thenceforth be deformed, and not function as\nwell.\nOlder people do not absorb calcium and other minerals as well. This begins at 40, increases at 50, and\nvery much so beyond 60. It is believed that 200,000 hip fractures occur in people over 65 every year.\nVery often, this results from osteoporosis. The bone has somewhat hollowed out and the break more\neasily occurred.\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures than other people their age.\nWhen a break occurs, protein fibers form a bridgework between the two parts. Then calcium,\nphosphorous, and silica are deposited between the protein fibers.\n(Oddly enough, although phosphorous is needed for good bone formation, you will find, below, that it is\nimportant that you avoid phosphorous foods if you want strong bones. This is due to the fact that\nphosphorous is the one mineral which is abundantly found in food. Yet too much of it in a meal locks\ninto the calcium and removes it from the body.)\nFirst aid includes covering any wound and immobilizing, or splinting, the broken part in the position it\nwas found (so the problem will not worsen during transport). Take the person to a physician or the\nhospital, depending on the seriousness of the problem. Medical treatment involves placing the bones in\ntheir proper position and keeping them there while healing occurs.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere may be extreme pain and tenderness in the injured area, a protruding bone, blood\nunder the skin, or swelling. There may be tingling, numbness, weakness, or paralysis below the fracture.\nA digit, or limb, may be at an abnormal angle or there may be pain at a specific place on a bone.\nA major fracture can cause a loss of pulse below the fracture, weakness, and inability to bear weight."},{"id":"disease-musculoskeletal-bone-spur","title":"Bone Spur","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Give vitamin C to bowel tolerance, along with vitamin E and magnesium.\n• Correct the calcium/phosphorous ratio by taking 2,000 mg of calcium a day.\n• Research indicates that plant-derived colloidal minerals tend to reverse spurs and\ncalcium deposits, without surgery, by remodeling the bones.\n• Do not eat meat, coffee, sugar, and alcohol. These upset the mineral balance in the body\nand retard healing.\n• Temporarily avoid citrus fruit.\n• A 1-2 week raw food fast can be helpful.\n• Rubbing the bottom of the feet with ice will help draw healing blood to the area. In the\nearly morning, walk barefoot outside on the wet grass.

Many in middle life who initially experience the pain of gout are overweight.\n• Those with gout need to reduce to 10-15% below calculated normal weight. However,\nweight reduction must be done gradually, so as not to stir up more urates and temporarily\nincrease the number of gout attacks.\n• Do not fast when you have gout. Doing so greatly increases the amount of uric acids in\nthe blood.\n• Drink at least 2 quarts of water a day between gout attacks, not only to get rid of the uric\nacid, but also to reduce the likelihood of kidney damage and kidney stones. Those with\ngout tend to have kidney stones.\n• A high-carbohydrate diet tends to increase uric acid excretion. In contrast, a high-fat diet\ndecreases excretion and may bring on a gout attack (even though they may be unsaturated\nfats). Keep your diet low in protein and fat.\n• A vegetarian diet is the best program for a person with gout.\n• Avoid excessive food yeast.\n• Eating cherries is very helpful. The uric acid level in the blood decreases and the attacks\ntend to stop. They can be any type of cherries, and either fresh or canned (½ pound per\nday). One or two tbsp. of cherry concentrate can be taken instead. If canned cherries are\nused, only use water-packed ones; most have too much sugar and additives.\n• Overeating tends toward gout.\nHere are foods high in purines: liver, brains, kidneys, heart, anchovies, sardines, meat\nextract, fish roes, herring, consommé, mussels, and sweet breads.\n• Here are foods of lesser purine content: fowl, fish (except those listed above), other\nseafoods, and other meats.\n• Here are foods of moderate amounts: whole-grain cereals, lentils, peas, beans, asparagus,\nmushrooms, oatmeal, cauliflower, and spinach.\n• Here are the foods which have only small amounts of purines; foods containing\nnegligible amounts of purines: vegetables, fruits, refined cereals, cereal products, eggs,\nmilk, cheese.\n• There are cases in which drinking large amounts of milk or eating lots of tomatoes\nproduced gout.\n• Do not take any alcoholic beverage. Alcohol increases uric acid production and reduces\nexcretion of urates.\n• Direct injury to a joint, tending toward gout, can bring on an acute attack.\n• It is known that the skin can excrete uric acid, so baths will help.\n• During acute attacks, keep the affected joint elevated and at rest.\n• Hot fomentations for 15 minutes every 3 hours, to help relieve pain. But, to reduce pain,\nsome do better using cold applications.\n• Mud packs, applied to the affected area, will absorb a fair amount of the uric acid.\n• Charcoal is very helpful. Take it by mouth (12-16 tablets daily), and also lay charcoal\npacks on the area.\n• A compress of comfrey root or leaves, blended with water, helps relieve gout pain.\nApply for two hours or more, or overnight.\n• Burdock will help clean uric acid deposits from the joints and other areas. Kelp, red\nclover, and yucca help eliminate uric acid and other toxins.\n• Colchicine is the primary drug medication for gout. But it causes nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, cramping, hair loss, anemia, liver damage, and decreased leukocytes and\nplatelets.

Uric acid is the end-product of the breakdown of purine compounds.\nGout typically attacks the smaller joints of the feet and hands, especially the big toe. Uric acid salts\ncrystallize in the joint, and produce swelling, redness, and a sensation of heat and extreme pain.\nUnlike most forms of arthritis, gout affects men in 90% of the cases. It generally does not begin until\nafter 35 years of age; peak age of onset is 45. Women who have it are generally post-menopausal.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSudden attack, often in the middle of the night, of extreme pain and swelling of a joint\nin the fingers or toes (usually the big toe). But it can affect the ankles, knees, hands, elbows, and wrists.\nMotion or pressure greatly increases the pain. After the swelling subsides, the skin tends to itch and peel.\nDuring attacks, there often is loss of appetite, stomach and intestinal problems, fever, and decreased\nurine output."},{"id":"disease-musculoskeletal-temporomandibular-joint-syndrome","title":"Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Hot and cold (or hot or cold) packs will help relieve pain in the neck and shoulders.\n• A diet rich in the B complex is important.

Between the ages of 15 to 80, a full 50% of people\nwill, at some time, have pain or cramps in the legs. Leg pains in children are frequent enough that they\nare called \"growing pains.\"\nReduced blood supply to the legs is part of the problem. Another is an imbalance in the levels of calcium\nand magnesium in the body or a deficiency of vitamin E.\nBut other causes have also been noted: arthritis, anemia, tobacco usage, inactivity, poor circulation, too\nmuch or too little exercise, muscle injury, allergy, fibromyalgia, arteriosclerosis, dehydration,\nhypothyroidism, heat stroke, and varicose veins. Diuretic drugs for heart problems, or hypertension can\nalso induce cramps. Those who have had part of the stomach removed tend to have muscle cramps\nthereafter.\nIf cramping occurs when walking and stops when you cease, it may be impaired circulation and nothing\nmore.\nIf leg cramps occur during pregnancy, they may be caused by hormone changes, fatigue, uterine\npressure, chilling, or muscle tenseness.\nA calcium deficiency can make the leg muscles trigger-happy; the contractions in the muscles are\nstronger.\nLeg cramps in older people may be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the circulatory system. Turn to\nthe articles on heart and blood vessels, and see your physician. Vitamin E (600-800 IU daily) is very\nhelpful.\nIMMEDIATE TREATMENT—\n• Massage the muscles and use heat to relieve pain.\n• A heating pad may be applied to the area. For some, alternate hot and cold compresses\nwork better (heat for 6 minutes and cold for 30 seconds, with 4 changes).\n• Drink peppermint tea and apply it as an external compress.\n• Pinch the upper lip between the thumb and index finger, and hold for 20-30 seconds till\nthe cramping disappears.\n• If you are pregnant and cramping occurs, push the toes upward while applying pressure\nto the knee, to flatten the affected part.\n• Here is the strangest advice of all: The next day, repeat the activity that made you sore.\nDo it with much less intensity. This will help work out the soreness. Thereafter, follow\nthis hard/easy routine; for it takes 48 hours for the muscle to properly recover. This is how\nserious athletes train.\n• An alternate method is to vary activities, such as regular walking, with occasional biking\nor swimming instead.\n• After hard exercise or physical work, slow down instead of stopping suddenly. The\nbloodstream is loaded with lactic acid; so slowly exercise at a relaxed pace while it drains\noff. (However, that will not protect you from soreness the next day, resulting from torn\nmuscle fiber.)\n• Perhaps you need to change into more comfortable shoes, in order to improve your leg\nand foot problems.\nONGOING CARE—The blood circulation needs to be improved and equalized.\nDrink enough water each day.\nA common mistake is to drink water and take salt tablets during heated exercise. Instead, you need a full\nrange of electrolytes, and not so much sodium chloride. Drink fruit drinks. At mealtime, eat lots of fresh\nfruits and vegetables. Include seaweed in your diet. Potassium broth (from thick white potato peelings)\nis excellent.\nA fat-free, sugar-free, salt-free diet improves the circulation.\nEat an abundance of green leafy vegetables, in order to improve the quality of the blood and the mineral\nbalance.\nAlfalfa, brewer's yeast, and kelp are important.\nA deficiency of calcium, potassium, selenium, and vitamin E exists.\nMineral imbalances can produce cramping. Be sure you are getting enough calcium through\nsupplementation. Otherwise the phosphorous in certain foods locks with it, so the calcium cannot be\nabsorbed. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for more information on solving the calcium-phosphorous\nproblem.\nThose with dentures, who find eating vegetables difficult, are especially prone to magnesium and\ncalcium deficiency and leg cramps. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw\nvegetable juices daily.\nEvery 3 hours, drink a large glass of quality water, to help clean the bloodstream, liver, kidneys, and\nbowels of stored toxins.\nDrink less whole milk\nEat your meals slowly and chew well.\nDo not smoke. Nicotine greatly impedes blood circulation. Avoid second-hand smoke.\nIf you are taking diuretic drugs, take supplemental potassium. Better yet, switch to corn-silk tea and\nother herbal diuretics; also drink more water (see the several articles on kidneys and urine).\nDo not stand in one position for hours without moving. Some motion or shifting of body weight is vital.\nGet off your feet for 5 minutes every hour. If possible, during that time, take your shoes off; massage\nyour feet and wiggle your toes.\nDo not sit with crossed legs.\nStretch your legs every so often, with the feet flexed up, not down.\nWhen sitting, try to elevate your feet every so often.\nDo not wear garters or any binding clothes.\nAt night, wear roomy pajamas.\nKeep the bed covers loose or use a foot cradle, to keep bedding weight off the feet. If you sleep on your\nstomach, extend your feet over the edge of the bed. Another method is to sleep on your side, with your\nlegs bent and a pillow between your knees.\nRub olive or flaxseed oil into your muscles before and after strenuous exercise.\nTwice a day, soak in a tub of warm water (100o-110o F.). Massage the toes, feet, and calves.\nHere is an exercise which really helps stop ongoing lower leg cramps for many people: Stand with shoes\noff, facing a wall 2-3 feet away. Lean forward, bracing against the wall with hands and arms, all the\nwhile keeping your heels on the floor. When a moderate pull is felt in the calves, hold that position for\n10 seconds.\nThen stand straight for 5 seconds of rest, and lean forward and repeat. Do 3 stretching cycles.\nIf you are overweight, reduce to normal range or slightly below.\nIf leg cramps are caused by varicose veins or pregnancy, elevate the foot of the bed 9 inches.\nIf leg cramping occurs during pregnancy, take frequent rest periods with the feet elevated. Wear\ncomfortable, not tight, clothing. Be sure you are getting enough calcium; this is important.\n—Also see \"Claudication,\" which has the same leg symptoms—but some very special, dangerous\ncauses.

Rest will generally eliminate the\nproblem. Bed rest for 24 hours may be needed.\n• Soaking in a tub of warm water may be quite relaxing to a strained back.\n• For the first 72 hours after a back strain occurs, an 8-minute ice massage often helps.\nUse ice cubes (or freeze water in a paper cup or frozen fruit- juice can). Massage the area\nand about 6-8 inches around it.\n• After 72 hours, use alternate hot and cold applications. Apply a wrung-out hot towel for\n30 seconds, followed by brief cold. Do this 4-5 times.\n• Ice packs are especially helpful in relieving muscles spasms.\n• Moist heat reduces local inflammation and increases blood flow to the area.\n• Some people think that staying in bed for a week will help back pain. This is not true. If\nyou remain in bed a week, it will take two weeks to rehabilitate.\n• Stretching a sore back will tend to accelerate the healing process. Gently bring your\nknees up from the bed and to your chest. Once there, put a little pressure on your knees.\nStretch, then relax. Do this again.\nPreventive measures that will help you, either before or after experiencing back problems:\n• Be very careful when lifting something. Take several deep breaths, to increase muscle\nstrength and then slowly lift with the legs, not the back, and hold the object close to your\nbody. Do not lift from a bending forward position (closing windows, lifting things from\ndeep in the car trunk).\n• Keep the body warm and do not become overly fatigued. When the muscles are chilled\nor you are exhausted, it is easier to injure joints because the muscles are not able to do the\nwork needed.\n• Do not take a hot bath just before doing heavy exercise, for your muscles will be in a\nweaker condition.\n• Proper nutrition, including adequate amounts of calcium, minerals, vitamin D, etc. See\n\"Bones, Strengthening\" for much more on this.\nExercises, to build the muscles are very important, if you would avoid back trouble. More on this later in\nthis article.\n• Walking and rowing are good for the back (walking is good for just about everything!).\n• When sleeping, either a firm mattress should be used or a ¾-inch thick ply board should\nbe placed beneath the top mattress. Place 1-2 pillows under the knees to straighten the\nlumbar curve. When lying on the side, flex the knees and place a pillow between them.\n• Avoid sleeping on the stomach; it increases the swayback and twists the neck. This is\ndue to the fact that the trunk, being heavier, sinks farther into the bed, causing the back to\narch.\n• It is reported that water beds, which do not make a lot of waves, may help people with\nback trouble to sleep.\n• When you get out of bed, roll out slowly and carefully. Do not sit straight up in bed.\n• If you have back pain, slide to the edge of the bed. Then, keeping your back rigid, let\nyour legs off the bed first. That will act as a springboard, lifting your upper body up and\noff the bed.\n• Sit in a straight chair with a firm back. The knees should be higher than the hips; if\nnecessary, use a small footstool. Avoid soft sofas and stuffed chairs. Chair arms help\nsupport the shoulders and upper back. Get up and move about every so often.\n• When in a car, push the car seat forward, to raise the knees higher than the hips. This\nlessens back and shoulder strain. Use safety belts.\n• Look for a car with adjustable lumbar support, and adjust the support down as low as it\ngoes. Then, if necessary, raise it a notch or two.\n• Do not stand in one position for long periods.\n• High-heeled shoes will bring trouble sooner or later. Women should wear low-heeled\nshoes if they want to protect their pelvic organs and spine.\n• Good posture when sitting, standing, or walking should be the goal.\nExercises to strengthen the back:\n• Do press-ups which are half a push-up. Lie on the floor, on your stomach. Keep your\npelvis flat on the floor and push up with your hands, arching your back as you lift your\nshoulders off the floor. This will help strengthen your lower back.\n• Do floor swimming. Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise your left arm and right leg.\nHold for one second, then alternate with the right arm and left leg. Go back and forth. This\nextends and strengthens the lower back.\n• Do a crunch sit-up. Lay on your back on the floor, with knees flexed and feet flat on the\nfloor. Cross your arms with your hands on your shoulders. Raise your head and shoulders\noff the floor as high as you can while keeping your lower back on the floor. Hold for one\nsecond, then repeat.\n• Know your limit when exercising. If you feel fine 1-2 days after exercising, then it is\nsafe to continue them.\n• Spinal surgery: Should you have a back operation? Sometimes the problem is so serious\nthat a back operation is necessary. But, if at all possible, try to avoid having one. Not only\nare they expensive, but frequently do not solve your movement and pain problems. It is an\nintriguing fact that, according to U.S. government reports, only 1% of those with back\npain obtains relief from back surgery. And there is always the possibility that the\noperation will only result in greater pain, more serious damage, and even less mobility.\nBut, after weighing all the possibilities, you may still decide to undergo it.\n—Also see \"Sciatica.\"\n(Low Back Pain; Sciatica; Slipped Disk; Lumbar Disk\nHerniation; Spinal Disk Prolapse)\n\nCauses\n\nBackache, or pain felt in the spinal column, is one of the most common reasons for\nhospitalization in the Western world. Your spinal column has a complicated interconnection of muscles,\ntendons, bones, and ligaments.\nIt is helpful to identify the various parts of the spine, also called the vertebrae (singular is vertebra): The\ntop part of the spine, where the neck is located, is called the cervical spine (or cervicals); the shoulder\nand mid-part (which protrudes outward in an adult) is called the thoracic; the lower portion (called the\nhollow of the back) is the lumbar; and the bottom part (ending in the tailbone or coccyx) is the sacrum.\nThe first cervical is the atlas. This enables your head to tilt up or down. The second is the axis; it permits\nyour head to turn from side to side.\nAches and pains in the lower back can be a chronic problem. This pain can be in the spine or it can be in\nthe sacroiliac. The sacroiliac joint connects (articulates is the correct word) the spine to the pelvic bone.\n(There can also be pain in the muscles of the lower back; it is called lumbago.)\nA subluxation occurs when two vertebrae get out of proper alignment with one another. A chiropractor\nputs these back in place for relatively little cost.\nSciatica is chronic pain in the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve, which\npasses down through the upper leg, can experience neuralgia and neuritis as a result of a pinched nerve\nin the lumbar region. If the problem is not solved, eventually the leg where the pain is may no longer\nreceive nerve signals from the brain or the central nervous system.\nThe intervertebral disks (also spelled discs) are made of cartilage and act as cushions between the\nvertebrae. Each disk has a tough, fibrous, outer layer surrounding a soft interior, which provides the\ncushioning.\nLumbar disk herniation and lumbar disk prolapse occur when the disk herniates (ruptures or breaks) and\nsome of this soft inner disk material pushes outward against the spinal cord to one degree or another.\nThis may be very serious; and, like sciatica, it can lead to muscle wasting, reduced nerve reflexes, and\nmuscle weakness. Disk herniation and prolapse are often erroneously referred to as a \"slipped disk.\"\nCauses of lower-back pain include wrenched or damaged muscles, bones, tendons, or ligaments, Kidney\nor bladder infection, prostate problems, or female pelvic disorders may cause backache. Overeating,\noverdrinking, eating the wrong kinds of food, and constipation can also be involved. The spinal bones,\nand muscles attached to them, are weakened by wrong habits. Chronic conditions causing back pain\ninclude arthritis, bone disease, or abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis).\nOther causes of back pain are poor posture, walking habits, improper shoes, lifting, straining, calcium\ndeficiency, slouching when sitting, or soft mattresses.\nThere is a definite relationship between smoker's cough and severe back pain. Injecting the nicotine\nequivalent of one cigarette decidedly reduced the measured blood flow in the vertebral body. It is also\nthought that using tobacco interferes with the elasticity of connective tissue.\nA small percentage of lower-back pain may be linked to flat feet.\nSometimes a serious case of constipation will cause an ache in the back, from impacted stools or\npressure from gas.\n(More rarely, back pain can result from congenital abnormalities, metabolic disorders, cancer, or\nreferred syndromes.)\nThe back pain can also be the result of an excess of lactic acid in the muscles, following muscular\nexercise. Drinking enough water helps lessen this problem.\nWhere can you go to get help with your bad back? There are lots of experts out there:\nChiropractors adjust the back by pushing and thrusting. They also recommend nutritional and lifestyle\nchanges. In 1994, the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research issued a report, that\nchiropractors generally provided the most effective treatments for acute back pain. They cost far less, do\nthe job quicker, and do not give medicinal drugs (most of which are usually poisonous). The British\nMedical Journal reported that chiropractic treatments proved more successful than hospital treatments in\nnearly every way.\nX rays are generally considered a routine part of back pain diagnosis; yet only a few back conditions\nshow up on x rays! If the pain is caused by muscle strain or a herniated disk, an x ray will not reveal\nanything because muscles, disks, and ligaments are all soft tissues. Beware of x rays if you are pregnant.\nOrthopedic surgeons are another source of help. These are medical doctors who also do back surgery,\nthey are very likely to recommend it—and that is something you want to avoid, if at all possible.\nOsteopaths can prescribe drugs and do surgery also, but they are less likely to do so.\nPhysiatrists, also called doctors of physical medicine, are also medical doctors. They have a good record\nof helping to solve serious back problems (such as disk problems) without resorting to surgery (which\nthey are not licensed to do). They recommend lifestyle changes, back braces, etc.\nPhysical therapists try to restore muscle strength and joint and spine mobility.\nWhich back pains are the most serious?\nBack pain that comes on suddenly, for no apparent reason.\nBack pain that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, stomach cramps, chest pain, or\ndifficult breathing.\nAn acute attack of back pain that lasts more than 2-3 days, without any relief.\nChronic pain which lasts more than 2 weeks.\nPain in the back which radiates down the leg to the knee or foot.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPain in the back, frequently in the lower back.\nIf pain comes after lifting something heavy, after coughing, or after unusually heavy exercise, and the\npain prevents you from moving or shoots down one leg, you may have a herniated disk."},{"id":"disease-musculoskeletal-rheumatic-fever","title":"Rheumatic Fever","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Give a nourishing diet, restricting all salt.

Eat\nnatural foods with sufficient bulk. Avoid processed and junk foods.\n• Meals high in complex carbohydrates help one deal with stress. It is thought that they\nincrease the production of serotonin, a brain chemical which counteracts depression.\n• An inadequate supply of B complex vitamins is another factor causing PMS. B vitamins\nand magnesium help the liver excrete unwanted estrogen. Fried foods block the absorption\nof magnesium.\n• Eating chocolate, caffeine, sugar, and excess sodium are additional causative factors.\nWomen who regularly consume caffeine are four times more likely to have severe PMS.\n• Red meat and dairy products help produce a hormonal imbalance—exactly the kind in\nPMS, excessive estrogen and inadequate progesterone.\n• Another factor is unstable blood sugar levels. This can be caused by hypoglycemia or\nsimply poor eating habits. Either way, eat complex carbohydrates and avoid the sugar\nfoods.\n• Food allergies are another related factor. Search out the offending foods and stop eating\nthem (see \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test\").\n• It is important that you not eat foods which contain hormones! Many have been added to\ndairy products (via cows and chickens) and meat.\n• Obtain a full supply of vitamin/mineral supplements.\n• Adequate calcium intake during the monthly cycle is very important. Blood calcium\ndrops 10 days before menstruation. A lack of it causes headaches, tension, nervousness,\ndepression, insomnia.\n• Magnesium and vitamin D help in calcium absorption. Adequate stomach acid is also\nneeded.\n• Do not use caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.\n• Fast for 1-3 days on fruit and vegetable juices before the period onset, to reduce\nproblems.\n• Regular outdoor exercise is important. Walk at least half a mile a day. This increases\noxygen intake, which in turn aids in nutrient absorption and elimination of toxins.\n• Here are herbs which may help reduce the pain of cramps: rosemary, black haw, cramp\nbark, red raspberry, kava kava, and angelica.\n• Selenium is an antioxidant and helps prevent menstrual cramps.\n• Use warm sitz baths, heating pad, or hot water bottle for cramps. This draws the healing\nblood and relaxes muscles.\n• Herbs helpful in treating PMS include dong quai, false unicorn root, fennel seed, squaw\nvine, blessed thistle, and sarsaparilla root. They help balance the hormones.\n• Some women with PMS are deficient in melatonin.\n• Wild yam cream contains a natural form of the hormone, progesterone, and helps many\nwomen. Rub the cream into the skin on the chest, inner arms, thighs, and abdomen just\nafter ovulation. The active ingredient is absorbed through the skin.\n• Vitamin E has been found useful in the treatment of PMS, with most improvement\nwhere benign breast disease was a major problem. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and helps\nprevent inflammatory reactions to dietary fats. It is possible that Vitamin A and zinc also\naids in this function.\n• Vitamin B (50-150 mg daily, especially during the 10 days preceding menstruation,\n6\nhelps relieve premenstrual edema, swellings, and soreness.\n• Discuss the problem with your spouse.

About 5% are incapacitated by it, and about a third report\nsymptoms severe enough to interfere with their daily life.\nBearing children or being married seems to increase the likelihood. The problem is a major cause of\ndivorce.\nHormonal imbalance is part of the PMS problem (see \"Menstrual Disorders\").\nThe liver regulates hormonal balance, by selectively filtering out of the blood and excreting unwanted\nexcess hormones. One of these is estradiol, a type of estrogen which causes problems. If not eliminated,\nit can build up in the body.\nPart of the hormonal imbalance problem is that there is too much estrogen in the body and not enough\nprogesterone. Fluid retention is the result. This affects the circulation and impedes oxygen and nutrient\nflow to the brain and female organs.\nAdditional causative factors are mentioned below.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere are over 150 symptoms linked to PMS, of which the most common include\nabdominal bloating, anxiety, acne, backache, breast swelling and tenderness, swollen feet, depression,\ncramps, food cravings, fainting spells, headaches, fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, nervousness, impatience,\ndrastic mood swings, angry outbursts.\nOther symptoms include sluggishness, lethargy, delusions, indecisiveness, dizziness, constipation,\nhemorrhoids, skin eruptions, and migraines."},{"id":"disease-reproductive-menstrual-disorders","title":"Menstrual Disorders","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• The diet should contain an adequate, but not excessive, amount of high quality proteins,\npreferably from non-meat sources.\n• Eat complex carbohydrates (whole grains), to avoid blood sugar drops.

Take brewer's\n12 6\nyeast, kelp, and essential fatty acids.\n• B vitamins, especially B and folic acid, help reduce some of the tensions associated\n6\nwith menstruation.\n• Deficiencies of essential fatty acids, together with cyclic hormonal patterns, produce the\nclassic symptoms of fragile emotions, irritability, etc.\n• Take vitamin A as beta-carotene during the last 14 days of the cycle.\n• Iron is vital because of the loss of blood each month. Vitamin C helps the body absorb\niron. Beware of supplemental iron during pregnancy! Iron-rich sources include blackstrap\nmolasses (best single source), apricots, and raisins. Iodine is also needed, when there is a\nblood loss.

In one study, eight patients were\nfreed of the problem when all foods they were allergic to were eliminated (see \"Allergies\"\nand \"Pulse Test\").\n• Allergenic foods most frequently listed were whey, milk, eggs, beef, chocolate, nuts,\nfish, beans, cauliflower, pepper, and cabbage.\n• Avoid overeating! This encourages abdominal congestion.\n• A low-salt diet helps relieve bloating and water retention.\n• Taking the birth control pill greatly upsets the entire hormonal system, and it does not\nrecover, even after the pill is stopped for many months or years.\n• Problems with the pituitary, adrenals, or thyroid may produce amenorrhea, or abnormal\nbleeding cycles. Stress or the birth control pill can seriously affect the adrenals (which\nproduce 20% of the total estrogen used by the body).\n• Extreme diets (strict fruitarianism, very low protein diets, or repeated strict weight loss\nregimens) can produce amenorrhea.\n• Poor body mechanics (poor posture) causes the female organs to move out of place, and\nthis can affect menstruation. Proper posture tends to reduce cramping.\n• Those who have diaphragmatic (abdominal) breathing tend to have no menstrual pain.\nAvoid belts and tight clothing about the waist.\n• Adequate exercise is also needed.\n• Avoiding constipation is very important.\n• Avoid overfatigue just prior to the period.

Good results generally follow water treatments.\nNOTE—The following two paragraphs were typed as part of the \"how to stop bleeding\" section, but\nthey have been placed here instead because they are lengthy, cover the subject of uterine bleeding well,\nand are not effectively duplicated in this present section of Kellogg formulas.\nFor hemorrhage from the uterus, apply short, very hot fomentations (or the hot douche) to the thighs\nand spine while an ice bag is placed over the lower abdomen and a hot vaginal douche is given. Another\nvery useful procedure for uterine hemorrhage is this: a very short hot douche to the lower back, the inner\nsurfaces of the thighs, and the soles of the feet. Prolonged cold applications to the same surfaces produce\nlike effects. These applications may be made either with or without a simultaneous use of the hot uterine\nor vaginal douche, according to the severity of the case.\nCaution: Cold applications must not be used in cases of menorrhagia (excessive bleeding during\nmenstruation, either in amount of loss or number of days), except with the utmost care and discretion, on\naccount of the danger of producing hematoma or hematosalpinx, through the sudden checking of the\noutflow of blood. Therefore, use only less strong measures during the first 24 or 36 hours of the period.\nReserve the cold applications to a later time. During the first day: The hot vaginal douche is better and\nsafer. \"The danger of producing hematoma is, in the author's opinion, very small after the first day.\"\nKellogg then tells of a girl who had suffered for nearly a year without relief, although she had gone to\nmany physicians.

The above measures will not solve the problem when the hemorrhage is due to\nvegetations, a uterine fibroid, or a malignant disease. In cases where the hemorrhage is accompanied by\nsevere nerve pain or acute pelvic inflammation, use very hot rather than very cold applications to the\ninside of the thighs and lower back region.

Saw palmetto and cayenne are also useful.\n—Also see \"Prostatitis\" and \"Prostate Cancer.\"\n(Prostatitis; Enlarged Prostate, Prostate\nHypertrophy; Prostate Cancer)\n\nCauses\n\nThe prostate is a doughnut-shaped male reproductive gland. It is under the urinary bladder,\nand surrounds the urinary tube (urethra).\nMuscles located within the prostate squeeze prostatic fluid into the urethral tract during ejaculation.\nMost of the semen consists of this fluid, which provides nourishment and protection for the sperm.\nThere are three primary prostatic problems:\nProstatitis: This is inflammation of the prostate gland, is common in men of all ages, and is the most\nfrequent type of prostate problem.\nThe inflammation tends to block off the urine flow (urine retention), and this causes bacteria to build up.\nSometimes hormonal changes, from aging, may be a contributing factor.\nWhen urine retention results, the bladder becomes distended, weak, tender, and liable to infection.\nInfection can easily pass up the ureters to the kidneys.\nEnlarged prostate: This is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy. It is the gradual enlargement of the\nprostate, and occurs in half of all men over 50, and three-fourths of men over 70. It is probably the most\ncommon infirmity of aging in the human male. More than 500,000 American men are afflicted each\nyear.\nIt is believed that, with age, testosterone production and levels decrease, and certain other hormones\n(prolactin and estradiol) increase. This results in more of a powerful form of testosterone, called\ndihydrotestosterone. This hormone causes an overproduction (hyperplasia) of prostate cells—and that\ncauses the prostate gland to become larger. As it does, it eventually tends to pinch upon the urethra, and\ninterfere with the flow of urine.\nAs a result, neither the bladder nor kidneys empty fully. This produces pressure which can damage them.\nUrination becomes more frequent. It flows more slowly, and there may be difficulty in starting and\nstopping the flow. Sometimes there is blood in the urine.\nHere is how to check your own prostate:\nThe prostate can be felt (palpated) with the gloved finger. If you are going to do this effectively, you\nwould need to examine it monthly. The normal prostate is firm like an orange and about the size of a\nwalnut. You would reach into the rectum, to carry out this examination. The prostate is found at a depth\nin the rectum that is just comfortably in reach of the index finger. An acute case of enlargement may be\nhard while a chronic enlargement may be boggy. Tumors, either benign or malignant tend to be irregular\nand nodular.\nProstatic cancer: An enlarged prostate can become cancerous; but, fortunately, it always proceeds very,\nvery, slowly. So slowly, in fact, that an operation to remove the prostate, because of cancer, is generally\nnot needed. This is because, before the man is likely to die of prostate cancer, he is quite aged and dies\nof something else first. But, of course, you will want to consult your medical specialist.\nThe suggestions below are for prostate problems, in general. For more information on home care, in\nthose instances in which cancer is present, see \"Cancer.\"\nVasectomy, for sterilization, has been linked to prostate disorders and even cancer.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPain on urination, frequent urination, urine retention, often a fever. There may be a\ndischarge.\nAcute prostatitis: fever, frequent and burning urination, pain between the scrotum and rectum, a feeling\nof fullness in the bladder, pus or blood in the urine.\nChronic prostatitis: frequent and burning urination, blood in the urine, lower back pain, impotence\n(inability to copulate).\nGradually, urination becomes still more difficult."},{"id":"disease-reproductive-prostatitis","title":"Prostatitis","lang":"en","text":"(J.H.

A weight gain of 20-35 pounds is desirable and, in most cases, is in keeping\nwith good health. But a number of problems can occur. Here are several of them. For more information,\nsee \"Morning Sickness,\" \"Premature Labor,\" and \"Miscarriage.\"\nMany of the problems occurring during pregnancy are related to hormonal changes, nutritional needs, or\nvarious expansion pressures as the fetus continues to grow.\nNUTRITION—Proper nutrition is important. There is a 20% increase of blood volume during\npregnancy. This requires additional complete protein.\nA healthy diet during this time would include 2 fruits a day, 7 vegetables (including salads, grains, and\nother worthwhile foods), etc. Complex carbohydrates, best obtained in whole grains, are important.\nComplete, vitamin/mineral supplementation is also important.\nVitamin A protects the immune system and avoids eye abnormalities, cleft lip, and cleft palate. Do not\nlet vitamin A intake go over 10,000 IU daily. Excessive intake of vitamin A is linked to cleft palate,\nheart defects, and other congenital defects. Foods rich in vitamin A may also cause problems. But foods\nwith natural beta-carotene are not harmful. (This is because it is only converted to vitamin A as it is\nneeded.)\nAll the B complex is important. They help prevent leg, back, and joint pains in the mother during\npregnancy.\nVitamin B (thiamine) prevents stillbirths, low-birth weight babies, and heart disorders. In late\n1\npregnancy and post-delivery, B requirements are greatly increased.\n1\nVitamin B (riboflavin) prevents short limbs and cleft palate.\n2\nVitamin B (niacin, niacinamide) prevents irritability, depression, disorientation, fatigue, nervousness,\n3\nand muscular weakness.\nVitamin B (pyridoxine) prevents several fetal abnormalities, including seizures, cleft lip, and cleft\n6\npalate. Take 100 mg daily until birth, followed by only 50 mg daily. This is because an excess of B\n6\nafter delivery can hinder the amount of mother's milk produced.\nFolic acid prevents anemia and birth defects. It is involved in cell growth and DNA production. But it is\nvital that this supplementation be started prior to conception. Take 400 mg daily. If there is not enough\nfolic acid in the system during the first six weeks of pregnancy, spina bifida and anencephaly can result.\nBut most women do not know they are pregnant until several weeks after conception has occurred.\nTherefore it is crucial that you be taking this vitamin regularly.\nVitamin C prevents infections and small babies.\nVitamin D works with calcium, to build strong bones.\nAll the vitamins are very important, but so are the minerals.\nMagnesium helps prevent birth abnormalities and miscarriage.\nCalcium prevents weak bones and teeth, premature births, and damaged nerves.\nAlthough phosphorous is important you always get enough in your food. Too much blocks iron and\ncalcium absorption. Soft drinks eliminate calcium. See \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\nThe trace minerals are also important. Nova Scotia dulse and Norwegian kelp are good sources.\nIodine prevents thyroid problems, abnormal development, and certain types of mental retardation.\nZinc prevents dwarfism and limb defects.\nManganese prevents certain brain abnormalities.\nInadequate folic acid, manganese, and zinc (as well as amino acid imbalances) have been linked to\nmental retardation and deformities in the fetus.\nDo not eat junk food of any type. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, spicy, fried, or overly processed\nfoods. If possible, avoid all drugs.\nSPECIAL NOTES—If at all possible, have your baby by natural childbirth—and with the help of a\nmidwife.\nBe sure and breast-feed your baby for at least the first three months, and longer if possible. (see \"Breast-\nfeeding.\")\nDo not use an electric blanket. Studies indicate it may increase risk of miscarriage and problems in\ndevelopment.\nAspirin has been linked to fetal deformities, bleeding, and complications during pregnancy.\nDo not use cinnamon in large quantities during pregnancy.\nThe drug, etretinate (Tegison), is prescribed for psoriasis, and can cause birth defects.\nAvoid the following herbs during pregnancy: feverfew, goldenseal, black cohosh, tansy, angelica,\nbloodroot, celandine, dong quai, Oregon grape, rue, cat's claw, barberry, cottonwood bark, and\npennyroyal.\nKeep yourself healthy, so you can continue eating an adequate diet. Avoid long fasts, cleansing diets, or\nstrictly limited diets during pregnancy and lactation (see \"Eclampsia\").\nDo not take anything containing shark cartilage during pregnancy. It reduces production of new blood\nvessels.\nDo not take supplements containing phenylalanine. This is an amino acid which can alter brain growth\nin the fetus. The sweetener, Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet), contains high levels of phenylalanine.\nA drug prescribed for acne (isotretinoin, under the trade name of Accutane) can cause birth defects.\nAvoid mineral oil; it inhibits the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.\nTwo medications, used to control seizures, increase by four times the risk of producing a baby with heart\ndefects. These drugs are phenobarbital and phenytoin (Dilantin).\nDrinking large quantities of coffee, cola drinks, or other caffeine sources can result in birth defects.\nCertain chemicals in drugs can stunt fetal growth. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and\nothers); antacids (Pepto-Bismol, Alka-Seltzer, Rolaids, Tums, Di-Gel, Maalox, Gelusil); aspirin; cough\nremedies; cold pills; antihistamines; estrogens; and decongestants.\nINDIGESTION—Eat smaller meals and chew your food well. Acidophilus, peppermint tea, ginger, and\naloe vera juice will help. Also see \"Indigestion.\" Do not take baking soda to alleviate indigestion,\nbecause the sodium content will increase fluid retention.\nANEMIA—It is important enough that you obtain enough iron, so you can avoid simple anemia.\nNatural iron herbal formulas, which include yellow dock and dandelion, will build up the blood.\nChlorophyll, kelp, dulse, rice bran, whole grains, beans, dried apricots, and green leafy vegetables are\nother sources. But the very best source of iron is blackstrap molasses.\nYou should be aware of the fact that bottled iron supplement tablets frequently have the wrong kind of\niron in them. Because it is not natural, it can block the absorption of vitamins E and A. Vitamin E is the\nantiabortion vitamin, and is needed in order to bring a baby to full term. Also see \"Anemia.\"\nCONSTIPATION—Constipation can lead to high blood pressure, water retention, toxemia (toxic\nblood), and injure both the mother and baby. It can also produce leg cramps, backache fatigue, and\nvaricose veins. Also see \"Constipation.\"\nBACKACHE—The increase in weight and shift in center of gravity can cause problems if the mother\ndoes not maintain proper posture and avoid fatigue. The hormone, progesterone, tends to relax the\nmuscles.\nDo not wear high-heeled shoes, and do not stay in one position too long (see \"Backache\").\nDIZZINESS—Especially during the second trimester, blood pressure drops as the uterus presses on\nmajor blood vessels.\nDo not arise or change positions quickly. Breathe deeper when you sense that you need to do so.\nBLEEDING GUMS—The gums tend to swell and become softer because of increased estrogen output.\nGive your teeth and gums special care, lest bleeding and infection occur.\nGAS—Flatulence will tend to occur more frequently during pregnancy than normally. Try to determine\nwhich foods are causing the problem. Make sure you are obtaining enough fresh fruit and vegetables.\n(Also see \"Bloating.\")\nMOOD CHANGES—Hormonal changes, stress, and nutritional needs affect this. Be sure and obtain\nenough B complex vitamins. Know that mood changes during pregnancy are normal and generally\ntemporary.\nFREQUENT URINATION—Changes in kidney function and uterine expansion frequently cause this.\nBut do not reduce intake of liquids, thinking this will solve the problem!\nGROIN PRESSURE—Ligaments near the uterus can kink and spasm, causing a \"stitch\" on the right\nside. In later pregnancy, more direct pressure on the groin area can occur.\nDuring a spasm, breathe deeply and bend toward the point of pain. Lay down and rest until the pain\nleaves. Be sure and maintain adequate daily exercises.\nINSOMNIA—This is especially likely during the final weeks of pregnancy. At this time, it is more\ndifficult to sleep comfortably.\nDo not sleep until you feel like doing so. Include more B complex vitamins in your diet. (Also see\n\"Insomnia.\")\nHEARTBURN—The expanding uterus presses on the stomach and causes fluids to push back up into\nthe esophagus.\nDo not eat fried, greasy, spicy foods. Avoid baking soda, coffee, alcohol, and antacids.\nDo not bend over or lay flat for several hours after a meal.\nWhile in bed, place pillows under or behind your abdomen. (Also see \"Heartburn.\")\nVARICOSE VEINS—These will usually disappear after childbirth. Walk a mile a day, to increase\ncirculation. Change positions frequently, and never cross your legs. Sit with feet elevated. If necessary,\nwear support hose. Do not wear bands on the legs (see \"Varicose Veins\").\nHEMORRHOIDS—Constipation and uterine pressure can induce formation of these. Drink more\nwater. Increase intake of roughage, to soften stools. Keep legs elevated on a stool while eliminating.\nApply cold witch hazel compresses to help shrink them. (Also see \"Hemorrhoids.\")\nSTRETCH MARKS—These are strips (often wave-like) which appear on the abdomen, breasts,\nbuttocks, and thighs. They are pressure marks and do not totally leave, but after childbirth can become\ndifficult to see.\nApply oil, once a day, all over the areas where the marks are likely to appear. The formula includes ½\ncup of olive oil, ¼ cup of aloe vera gel, 6 capsules of vitamin E, and 4 capsules of vitamin A. Cut open\nthe capsules, mix it all together, and apply.\nLEG CRAMPS—Extra weight on the legs, nutritional deficiencies, and too much salt in the diet can\ncause this.\nElevate the legs while sleeping, so they are higher than your heart. Do not stand in one place too long.\nFlex your feet every so often. Take adequate calcium and potassium. Apply a heating pad to the\ncramping area."},{"id":"disease-reproductive-premature-labor","title":"Premature Labor","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• A balanced high-protein diet.

There are\nthose who have taken the natural remedies route, with the same end results. No one can, or\nought to, decide for you; the decision is yours.\n• In the late 1980s, researchers discovered that women develop breast cancer far more\nfrequently in certain localities than in others. Analyzing those locations, it was discovered\nthat they are those areas where there tends to be less sunlight throughout the year. For\nexample, northwestern California, the western slopes of Oregon and Washington, and the\nNortheast had a far greater number of breast cancer cases than did Florida, Texas,\nArizona, and southern California. The solution: Take sunbaths whenever you can,\nthroughout the year; sunlight is important for maintaining good health, purifying the body,\nand resisting infection.\n• Breast cancer more often occurs in women who started menstruation early in their youth,\nhad a late menopause, gave birth later in life, had a family history of breast cancer,\ndeveloped obesity after menopause, and had a history of alcoholism and eating a high-fat\ndiet.\n• Research indicates that those who take oral contraceptives are 3 times more likely to\ndevelop breast cancer. Silicone (used in breast implants) causes cancer in test animals.\nThose who develop breast, and other, cancers have less vitamin A in their bodies.\n• Eat a nutritious diet centered around fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts.\nEat garlic and onions. Drink distilled water and fresh fruit and vegetable juices. Get extra\nfiber.\n• Do not eat too much soy or peanut products.\n• Avoid meat; dairy products; alcohol; caffeine; nicotine; and processed, fried, white-\nflour, and junk foods. Do not take supplements containing iron.\n• You should examine your breasts regularly. Procedures for doing this, and what to watch\nfor, are discussed in many other books. You will be able to detect initial changes better\nthan anyone else. If you experience itching, redness, and soreness of the\nnipples—especially if you are not currently breast-feeding a baby—check with a\nphysician. You might have Paget's disease of the nipple, a form of cancer. See \"Paget's\nDisease.\"\n—Read the sections on \"Cancer\" and \"Cancer Prevention\" for detailed information.\n\nCauses\n\nBreast cancer is a leading cause of malignant death among women in the United States.\nWomen over forty are more likely to develop breast cancer than younger women. Lung cancer kills\nabout 56,000 women in America each year, and breast cancer is responsible for the death of about\n46,000.\nIt is vital that early detection be made. Discussions of how to carry out breast self-examination are\nreadily available elsewhere and need not be repeated here. As you conduct it, watch for subtle changes\nin the breast. You are looking for special types of lumps in the breast. These lumps are firm, do not go\naway, and are generally pain free. Lumps which do not move around may be malignant or may be\ncaused by normal fibrocystic changes during the menstrual cycle. The experts say a biopsy will detect\nwhat kind of lump it is.\nBut you should know that biopsies can be dangerous. A biopsy is a slice of the tissue which is then sent\nto a lab for microscopic examination. The problem is that slicing any suspected tissue—immediately\nreleases its cancer (if any is present) into the body, where it can more rapidly spread. You may or may\nnot choose to have biopsies made, but you should be aware of this fact.\nYou will often hear it said that \"1 in 9\" women will contract breast cancer—but that is sometime within\na lifetime. The average 30-year-old white woman has a 1 in 5,900 chance of getting it; at 50 years, it is 1\nin 430.\nThere are several different types of breast cancer. Most of them are similar, producing lumps described\nabove. But a few are different:\nPaget's disease of the nipple affects the nipple, and cannot be detected by a self-examination. Cancer\ncells have migrated to the nipple. The symptoms are itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple. This\nform of cancer only occurs when a different form of cancer is present elsewhere in breast tissue.\nInflammatory carcinoma is a different type. The skin thickens and turns red. The breast becomes\nextremely tender and appears infected with something. The lymphatic system and blood vessels have\nbecome clogged because of a tumor. This type of cancer spreads very rapidly. Professionals recommend\na biopsy; but, if you choose not to do so, you must be planning to go on an intense natural remedies\ncleansing, to eliminate the problem. Whatever you do, you had better set to work and do it.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn the most common types: Lumps are firm, do not go away, and are generally pain free.\nLumps which do not move around may be malignant or may not be.\nIn another type: There is itching, redness, and soreness of the nipple.\nIn yet a third type: The breast becomes extremely tender and appears infected with something.\nThese three are explained in more detail below."},{"id":"disease-reproductive-prostate-cancer","title":"Prostate Cancer","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Contact your physician.\n• Go on a program with a nourishing diet, vitamin and mineral supplementation, and out-\nof-door exercise.\n• Do not eat meat. There is a definite correlation between red meat consumption and\nprostate cancer.\n• Drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices daily.\n• Avoid processed and junk foods.\n—Read the sections on \"Cancer\" and \"Cancer Prevention\" for detailed information.\n\nCauses\n\nThe prostate is a walnut-sized gland at the base of the bladder and encircles the urethra, the\ntube through which the bladder voids urine. The prostate makes prostatic fluid which nourishes the\nsperm.\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Americans. Poor diet, exposure to\nenvironmental toxins and cancer-causing chemicals, and overactivity of the sexual organs are possible\ncauses. There is a link between a high-fat diet and prostate cancer. It is believed, by some, that a\nvasectomy may increase the likelihood that this problem will later develop.\nMen over 65 have 80% of the cases of prostate cancer, and 80% of 80-year-old men have it.\nThe younger a man is, when he is diagnosed with prostrate cancer, the worse the outlook. Those with\nrecurring prostate infections are at greater risk. Men whose ancestors had prostate cancer are more likely\nto develop it. African American men have the highest rate, and Asiatic American men have the lowest.\nA careful, but relatively simple, rectal examination can reveal if cancer is developing in this organ.\nThere are also other screening methods, and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) appears to be the best. The\nPSA test should be taken twice if there is an indication of cancer.\n—For much, much, more discussion and suggestions on this, and other, malignancies, see \"Cancer.\"\n\nSymptoms\n\nPossible pain or burning sensation during urination, frequent urination, a decrease in\nthe size and force of urine flow, an inability to urinate, blood in the urine, and continuing lower-back or\npelvic discomfort just above the pubic area.

Once it arrives, it cleanses toxins from\nthe system and, along with the rest, enables the person to get back into better shape. A\ncold is actually a blessing, for it forces people to rest who, otherwise, would prematurely\ndevelop debilitating, chronic, and life-threatening diseases.\n• A cold is always in the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, and upper\nbronchials). If congestion develops in the chest, the cold is worsening into something even\nmore serious!\n• Do not ignore a cold and drag on with your work. As soon it develops—go to bed, drink\nfresh lemon juice in water, and settle down to getting well!\n• If you do not know how to take care of yourself, you had better contact a physician,\nespecially if:\n(1) Chills and shortness of breath occur.\n(2) An accompanying fever goes above 101o F. for more than three days, or\nany fever above 103oF.\n(3) Yellow or white spots appear in the throat.\n(4) The lymph nodes under the jaw and in the neck become enlarged.\n(5) Any hot, extreme pain, such as earache, swollen tonsils, sinus pain, or\naching lungs or chest occurs.\n(6) There is excessively large amounts of sputum or sputum that is greenish\nor bloody.\n(7) There is extreme difficulty swallowing.\n(8) Wheezing occurs.\n(9) There is shortness of breath.\n• If you have a sore throat, beware of white or yellow patches on the throat. These can be\nGroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci, which can damage the heart muscle. Have a throat\nswab done when there might be a question about this.\n• Children with high fevers should see a physician within 24 hours.\n• Treatment should include as much vitamin C as you can take, without producing\ndiarrhea (up to 5,000 mg at a time). In acute cases, 1,000 mg of C every other hour. Also\ntake bioflavonoids (200-600 mg), small amounts garlic. (along with vitamin C, it is an\nexcellent germ fighter), vitamin A (50,000 units for not more than one month; then down\nto 25,000 units), calcium lactate or gluconate (6 tablets), brewer's yeast, B6 (100 mg; it is\na natural antihistamine, as well as providing helpful protein), vitamin E (600 units),\nbetaine hydrochloride, zinc gluconate lozenges, and vitamin F (unsaturated fatty acids)\nreduces the frequency and duration of colds.\n• In acute stages when fever is present, the person should abstain from all solid foods and\nonly drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices, diluted (50-50) with water, plus herb teas. The\nproper treatment of colds is to encourage elimination through all channels, so that\nelimination through one channel does not become excessive.\n• As soon as the crisis subsides, let the person have some protein and other food.\n• Drink potato peeling broth twice a day. The peelings should be one-half inch thick\n(throw away the centers). Boil it for about 20-30 minutes; strain, cool, and drink. Make it\nfresh every day.\n• Avoid chills, get adequate bed rest, and take a little salt to replace that lost in sweat.\n• After the fever subsides, a low calorie raw fruit and vegetable diet can be eaten. This\nshould include plenty of raw juices and herb teas, sweetened with a little honey. Some raw\nseeds and nuts can be eaten, but should be chewed well.\n• Herb teas can include rose hips, golden seal, chamomile, peppermint, slippery elm,\nginger, desert tea. Eucalyptus oil is helpful. Put 5 drops in a hot bath or 6 drops in a cup of\nboiling water. Put a towel over your head and, without burning yourself, inhale it. Licorice\nroot tea, drunk daily, soothes an irritated throat and relieves coughing. You might wish to\ntake hop tea to help you get to sleep at night.\n• Avoid aspirin (especially for children), since it causes internal bleeding. There is also\nanother problem: What you think is of little consequence may be flu or\nchickenpox—which are caused by a virus. Colds are also. When children who have\ncertain viral infections take aspirin, their risk of developing Reye's syndrome is greatly\nincreased! This is a rare but fatal brain and liver disease. The same warning applies to cold\nmedications containing aspirin.\n• As already mentioned, take vitamin C, zinc, and garlic. Avoid being depressed; try to be\ncheerful. There is healing in this. Keep looking to Jesus and praying to God. Let a friend\nread a Bible promise to you every so often; think about it. Rest and relax and do not\nworry. Keep warm, but get fresh air from time to time. Take a lot of liquids. Gargle three\ntimes a day with saltwater (1 glass of warm water with 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in). Take\na hot shower.\nThere are a variety of water treatments which can be applied:\n• Take a hot mustard foot bath to increase eliminations and reduce head and sinus\ncongestion.\n• Take a hot Epsom salt bath while drinking sweating teas. Pour Epsom salts (1-2 lbs.)\ninto a hot tub. While soaking, drink 2-3 cups of hot pleurisy root tea. Immediately after\nthe bath, get into bed and cover with plenty of blankets, so profuse sweating can begin.\n• Take a hot ginger chest compress.\n• Use salt water nasal douche to open the sinuses.\n• Apply a trunk pack. Apply a full cold trunk pack each evening. The objective is to\nstimulate skin elimination and induce perspiration. Leave it on for at least 3 hours at night.\n• Take a steam inhalation, using eucalyptus, pine needles, cloves, and/or thyme.\n• Apply a cold compress to the neck, and leave it on for 1-3 hours or all night. It must\n(must) dry out before morning, or the value has been lost. If it does not change into a\nheating compress, it can increase the sore throat condition.\nPREVENTION—Once contracted, a cold must run its course. So it is better, far better, to prevent it\nthan cure it. The best prevention is to live right, eat right, get enough out-of-door exercise to strengthen\nthe body, and get enough rest. Do not skimp on sleep at night, especially in the colder months. Do not\nshare food with someone who has a cold. Be sure and dress warmly enough when it is cold. Do not sit in\na draft. Do not go outside with a wet head.\nMany people, who are especially susceptible to colds, never get them. They have learned to live above\nthe level where they contract such infections. Learn the distant early warning signs.\nNOTE—Most of the following recommendations would also apply to coughs and flu.\n\nCauses\n\nIn one sense, the cause is a variety of viruses. But in another, the person has allowed himself\nto become run-down so that the virus was able to take hold. Factors which lower the body's resistance to\nvirus infection are overexposure to cold, fatigue, recent or present infections, allergic reactions, and\ninhalation of irritating dust or gas, overeating, wrong eating, and sugar or alcohol consumption.\nThe common cold is not an infection that leaps out and attacks an innocent passerby. It is not even a\ndisease. A cold is the cure of a pre-diseased condition. and the symptoms are attempts by the body to\nreestablish normal conditions. The body is carrying out a \"spring cleaning.\"\nThe cold virus can change size and shape, making it impossible to produce a suitable vaccine. There are\nmore than 100 different viruses which cause colds.

Eat right, keep proper hours, exercise in the open air, and breath deep. Tone up\nyour whole body.\n• They also appear more frequently in adolescents who are experiencing hormonal\nchanges, especially between 12 and 16.\n• Deficiencies of vitamins A, C, and zinc have all been related to an increased incidence of\nviral infections.\n• The usual methods of removing warts (surgery, acids, burning, electrotherapy, or\nfreezing) often results in their reappearance. The underlying causes should be eliminated:\nImprove the diet; eat foods high in vitamins A, B complex, C, and zinc. Also increase the\nsulfur-containing amino acids in the diet, such as are found in asparagus, citrus fruits,\neggs, garlic, and onions. Be sure and take enough vitamin C every day! Eat raw garlic.\n• Place thin sections of garlic on the wart. Try to avoid touching the garlic to normal\ntissue. Hold it in place with cloth and tape and leave it there overnight. Do this for 2 or 3\nnights. Within a week the wart will fall off.\n• Apply castor oil to the wart, for 3 weeks.\n• Cover with honey, for 15 days.\n• Put 1 drop muriatic acid on the wart once a day, for 8 days.\n• Dissolve as much sodium carbonate (washing soda) in water as will stay in solution.\nSwab this onto the warts for 2 minutes, 4 times a day, and let it dry in the air. Very large\nwarts have responded to this.\n• Apply the juice of milkweed, celandine herb, or the milk from green figs or marigold to\nthe wart.\n• Mix castor oil and baking soda into a paste and apply to wart, cover, and keep on all\nnight. Do not pick at it, but let it slough off within 3-6 weeks.\n• Apply an iron formula, such as Ironite or black walnut tincture.\n• Apply castor oil to the wart for half an hour, 3 times a day.\n• Apply powdered vitamin C, as paste, and cover.\n• Soak the wart in a concentrated salt water solution: 1½ tsp. salt to ½ cup water equals a\n30% solution. Soak the wart for 20 minutes 2-3 times a day for a few weeks.\n• Here are several other helpful applications: green fig juice; that is, juice from barely ripe\nfigs (or milkweed sap) applied several times a day. Fresh grated celandine juice. Cut a raw\npotato, rub it on, and repeat several times a day for several weeks. Chickweed juice.\nSassafras oil. Green papaya juice. Aloe vera. Onion and salt compress. The juice of white\ncabbage. Wheat germ oil. Fresh pineapple juice. Cashew nut.\n• For plantar warts (warts on the bottom of your foot), apply a plantain poultice (the leaf\nitself) to the wart. Another method is to place the inner side of a fresh piece of banana skin\nover the wart and hold it there with tape. Change daily after washing the entire area. Once\na week the thickened outer horny layer is removed. Maximum time for complete\ndisappearance of a wart is 6 weeks, with no recurrence within 2 years.\n(Papillomas)\nSYMPTOMS AND CAUSES—There are three primary types of skin warts:\n1 - Contagious (viral) benign skin warts (verruca vulgaris); these are also called common warts and may\nbe found on the hands, arms, face, or body. These warts, which can be dark or flesh-colored, may range\nin size from a pinhead to a bean, and most frequently occur where the skin is in friction with clothing,\netc. They can also occur on the larynx (voice box) and produce hoarseness. They can be spread by\npicking, trimming, or touching them. On the face, they can be spread by shaving.\n2 - Plantar warts are verruca on the sole of the foot. Both types of verruca are actually benign epithelial\ntumors, caused by a virus.\n3 - Venereal warts (condylomata acuminata) may be found on the vulva and penis. Venereal warts are\ncaused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), of which there are more than 35 types. Genital warts on a\nwoman can change into cancer of the cervix or genital area. They should be removed! One study showed\nthey can increase the risk of cervical cancer by 200 percent! The incubation period for genital warts is\ngenerally 3 months. It can spread to others even before the person realizes he or she has it. Professionals\nrecommend that you not have sexual intercourse until these types of warts are eliminated.\nWith the exception of plantar warts which are flat, warts are always raised bumps. Where there is\nconstant contact, they can cause discomfort and even pain. Venereal (genital) warts are single or clusters\nof soft cauliflower-like growths."},{"id":"disease-skin-heat-rash","title":"Heat Rash","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Take a soda alkaline bath.

Its\nprimary symptom is eczema. Dermatitis is actually an allergy which may be caused by\ncontact with perfumes, cosmetics, rubber, medicated creams and ointments, poison ivy, or\ncontact with metal alloys (including nickel, silver, and gold). Some type of food could be\nthe problem. If the irritant continues to be in constant contact with the skin, the dermatitis\nwill spread and get worse. Obviously, if you have this problem you want to solve it!\n• The condition can be intensified by emotional stress and fatigue. Deficiency of any of\nthe B complex vitamins can cause dermatitis. Another important item is unsaturated fatty\nacids. If you are not getting enough, you can begin itching wherever you rub on your skin.\nAdequate vitamin A and enough protein are also essential.\n• Oddly enough, hair loss (alopecia) is commonly associated with dermatitis, especially if\na concurrent unsaturated fatty acid deficiency in the diet exists.\n• If the dermatitis is not terminated, it can so weaken the system, so that more serious\ninfections occur. This is because, at the same time that you are having skin problems, your\nintestines are developing lesions which can greatly weaken your ability to digest and\nabsorb nutrients!\n• It is a fact that 13% of those with severe dermatitis later develop cataracts.\n• Here are some of the allergies which the experts have found to especially cause\ndermatitis:\n1 - Cow's milk. Either stop drinking cow's milk or try switching to goat's\nmilk.\n2 - Wheat gluten (wheat protein). There are other grains you can eat instead.\n3 - Nickel. The experts call this \"nickel rash.\" Women who have their ears\npierced and the nickel post placed in them can produce various rashes on\nthe body—especially where any other metal jewelry touches the skin. By\nthe way, any gold jewelry less than 24-karats has some nickel in it.\n• Beware of the bubble bath and similar soapy tub baths.\n• Children's rashes: A skin rash in children may be caused by eating eggs, peanuts, milk,\nwheat, fish, chicken, pork, or beef. Eggs, peanuts, and milk account for 75 percent of the\nskin rashes in children.\n• Regardless of what may be the cause, omit wheat, rye, oats, and barley for six weeks.\nThen slowly add one back at a time—and see how all this effects the dermatitis.\n• If you know how to do so, you may wish to do a pulse test after each meal, in an attempt\nto ascertain which foods increase heart beat. Those which do are the problematic ones.\n• Avoid dairy products, white flour, fried foods, other processed fats, and sugar. Avoid\nantiperspirants, for they have metal in them. Use cotton undergarments. Fake fingernails\ncause skin rashes. Always use white bathroom tissue only. The dyes irritate the skin. Be\nsure and rinse the soap out of your clothes which have just been washed.\n• Mix goldenseal root powder with vitamin E oil and put some on the affected area. This\nwill reduce the itching.\n• Primrose oil and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) have helped infants with dermatitis.\n• An oatmeal bath is another helpful measure, to reduce the itching during the time\nrequired to solve the underlying cause. Use 2 cups of colloidal (powdered) oatmeal per\ntubful. Colloidal oatmeal can be obtained at a pharmacy.\n• Herbs that may help include comfrey, dandelion, red clover, and pau d'arco.\n• Steep a tbsp. each of burdock root, yarrow, and yellow dock root in a pint of boiling\nwater for half an hour. Strain, add a pound of cocoa fat, and keep boiling and stirring until\nit is a salve. Use this for eczema.\n• Other useful herbs are plantain, chickweed, burdock root, yarrow, and strawberry leaves.\nOne can either drink the tea made from any of them or apply it to the affected area.\n—Also see \"Drug Rash,\" \"Skin Disorders.\""},{"id":"disease-skin-psoriasis","title":"Psoriasis","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• There is no certainty that one can totally eliminate psoriasis. Do not spend time worrying\nover the matter, for the resultant stress may only aggravate it.\n• Only the scales and skin debris can be removed. Because psoriatic skin is dry, it is well\nto put petroleum jelly or vegetable oil on the area. Researchers have found that covering\nlesions with tape or plastic wrap for days or weeks can sometimes help clear it up. This\nseems to work only for small areas, no larger than half a dollar. But do not let the area\nbecome gooey and infected.\n• Lose weight if you are overweight. Weight loss helps many who have psoriasis.\n• Heavy stress can make it worse; try to retain a calm, cheerful outlook on life. Existing\npsoriasis tends to get worse when you come down with some other infection.\n• Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light reduces the scaling and redness. With regular\namounts of intense sunlight, 95% of psoriasis sufferers improve. But keep in mind that too\nmuch ultraviolet light also produces skin cancer.\n• You may wish to consider moving to a warmer climate, since the problem becomes\nmuch worse in the winter.\n• An increased intake of animal protein can make it spread outward; conversely, a\nreduction tends to shrink it. Citrus juices may also be a problem.\n• Since psoriasis is a metabolic disease, a cleansing juice fast, 2-3 times for the first week,\nis a good way to begin working toward its recession. Four weeks later, the fast can be\ncarried out again. But in the meantime, an extremely nourishing diet should have been\nstarted. All junk food should have been discarded. Search out, and eliminate, allergy\nfoods. Beware of milk and wheat. It may be well to exclude them for 6 months, even if\nthey may appear harmless.\n• Avoid fats (butter, milk, cream, eggs, meat), processed food, white flour, sugar, and\ncitrus fruit. Red meat and dairy products contain arachidonic acid, which makes the\nlesions turn red and swell. Get your oils from natural foods, such as flaxseed, sesame seed,\nand soybeans.\n• Vitamins A, B complex, C, and D all help the skin and appear to be of help in reducing\npsoriasis.\n• Swimming in the ocean is good for reducing psoriasis. Bathing in heated baths is also\nhelpful, but it also tends to increase the itching. Put seawater, several times a day, on the\narea.\n• The various medicinal drugs recommended for psoriasis all have potentially dangerous\nside effects.\n• To reduce the itching, a cold-water bath, perhaps with a cup or so of vinegar added, is\nvery helpful. Another help is ice. Put some in a plastic sack and hold on the area.\n—Also see \"Skin Disorders.\"\n\nCauses\n\nThe skin cells seem to run out of control. Instead of skin renewing itself in 30 days, the new\ncells reach the top layer in 3 days. This produces raised areas of skin, called plaques, which are red and\noften itchy. Because so many cells are rising and dying (as they normally do), they have a raised,\nsilvery, patchy appearance.\nPsoriasis may be linked to faulty fat utilization. Attacks are related to times of stress, illness, surgery,\ncuts, certain viral and bacterial infections, sunburn, poison ivy, or poison oak. The drugs such as\nchloroquine, lithium, and beta-blockers also cause it to flare up.\nThere appears to be a hereditary factor involved.\nPrevious immunizations seem to be a causative factor for some people.\n\nSymptoms\n\nIt appears like patches of silvery scales or red areas, and is found on the scalp, arms,\nlegs, knees, elbows, ears, and back. There are cycles of flare-ups and remission. Sometimes it disappears\nfor months or years, and especially occurs in winter months. In some, aging makes it better; in others,\nworse.

In the early stages, you can rub the area with a cloth dipped in cold water or snow.\n• Do not apply more heat than mentioned above, for the skin is numb and can be burned\nwithout anyone realizing it. Unless it is all you have, do not use dry, radiant heat (such as\na heat lamp or campfire). Frostbitten skin can easily burn, for it does not feel the heat.\n• To warm the hands, place them under your armpits. Roll yourself into a ball to conserve\nheat. Stay out of the wind. Do not get wet. Do not drink or smoke; both block circulation\nto the extremities. If outside, stay in your car or truck until help comes.\n• Living tissue is dying, so thaw the area quickly. Do not allow it to refreeze. Do not take\noff your boots until it is safe to do so. The foot may be swollen and you might not get it\nback on. If considerable walking must be done to find a place of safety, leave the feet\nunthawed until you arrive at your destination.\n• Move the person to a warmer place. Wrap him in blankets.

But pray and get yourself prepared for whatever\nmay happen.\n• After the suction process is over, take charcoal from the campfire, mix it with water and\ndrink it, as follows: a half glassful of water with 1 teaspoon of charcoal, and drink another\none every 15 minutes until the danger is past.\n• If able to do so, a couple hours later, take a steam bath or something similar, to sweat out\nthe poison.\n• Throughout all this time, you should eat no food.\n• If, after several hours, the bite area is still swollen and painful, put kerosene on a cloth\nand apply it, keeping it wet for several hours. This will help neutralize the poison. An\nalternative is to grind up raw onions and apply to the area. Leave them there until an\noffensive odor, not of onions, is noticed. Remove; bathe the area; and apply more raw,\ncrushed, onions until the pain is gone.\n\nCauses\n\nThere are two types of poisonous serpents in North America:\nThe pit viper (which includes rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cotton mouths [also called water\nmoccasins]) has a deep, heat-sensitive, pit on each side of the head. Pit vipers lunge forward, bite, and\nimmediately pull back. Their venom contains a blood poison.\nThe coral snake does not jump and, when it catches hold of the flesh, must hold on and chew awhile for\nthe poison to sink in. Its venom is a nerve poison.\nMore on identifying coral snakes: They are found only in the southernmost areas of the United States, as\nwell as south of the border, and have brightly colored rings. There is a non-poisonous snake which looks\nsimilar, but the colored rings are arranged differently. Remember it this way: \"Red by black, friend of\nJack; but black by yellow, kill a fellow.\"\nThe danger from snake bite occurs when the poison reaches the heart, and, secondarily, the effect of that\npoison on the blood and nervous system.\nThe action of the venom is rapid, regardless of the type of poisonous snake. There is rapid swelling and\ninflammation.\nIf treatment is not immediately given, the poison may cause death. If not death, then, after the initial\neffects of pain and shock begin to wear off, extensive tissue damage begins. There is suppuration,\ngangrene, sloughing, and hemorrhage. If this happens, recovery time is greatly slowed.\n\nSymptoms\n\nOne or two tiny bite holes which cause intense pain; frequently there is nausea,\nvomiting, and unconsciousness."},{"id":"disease-skin-dog-or-animal-bite","title":"Dog Or Animal Bite","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• If you have been bitten, remove the animal's saliva from the wound by washing the area\nthoroughly with warm water, and then with soap and water.

Notify health authorities, so they\ncan observe the animal.\n—See \"Rabies\" for detailed information about this danger and what should be done.

Take vitamin C to bowel tolerance (all you can, before its\nacidity causes a slight diarrhea). Take vitamins A, B complex, and E. Be sure selenium\nand zinc are in your diet. Eat more fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as seaweed.\n• If the drug has an acid base, consider taking a soda alkaline bath (Water Therapy\nManual, p. 142)(see order sheet). Fill a bath tub with water at 95o-98o F. Add about a cup\nof baking soda or sodium bicarbonate. Sitting in the tub, dip and pour it over yourself.\nAfter 30-60 minutes, stand in the tub, partially drip dry, and pat yourself dry.\n—Also see \"Eczema.\"\n\nCauses\n\nIt is truly surprising what a high percentage of medicinal drugs are poisonous. But it need\nnot be, when the underlying modus operandi (method by which they work) is understood.\nMedicinal drugs work by introducing a strange new poison into the body. The system immediately turns\nits attention from the debilitated area—and begins fighting the drug. The type of poison (the drug)\nintroduced, and the way it operates, affects the reaction of the body. For example, the body was\neliminating sulphur through a boil but then a drug is introduced, and the boil seemingly \"heals.\" The\nbody has let the boil no longer suppurate, so attention can be diverted to the radical poison which has\nbeen introduced.\nNatural remedies operate in a different way: They clean out the body and restore it to a healthy\nnormalcy. Whether it be fresh air, pure water, nutritious food, simple herbs, or water treatments, the\nnatural remedies assist the body in carrying on its work of cleansing the body. For that is what \"dis-ease\"\nis: an effort of nature to cleanse the body of impurities and eliminate the effects of enervation.\nA drug is a foreign substance of a poisonous nature. The healing herbs are not \"drugs.\" It is true that\nabout five of every 100 herbs is poisonous, but natural therapy only uses the safe ones. The poisonous\nones can be purchased at the drugstore or grocery counter (tobacco, coffee, black tea, chocolate, black\npepper, digitalis, quinine, etc.). Such things as aspirin, valium, phenobarbital, dilantin, morphine, etc.,\nare foreign chemical substances of a poisonous nature. They all produce dangerous side effects, called\n\"contraindications.\"\nIn contrast, the safe herbs are the ones you eat (all your worthwhile vegetables) and use for treating your\nills. They were given us by the God of heaven (Genesis 1:29).\nMost of the damage that drugs inflict on the body is beneath the skin, but drug rashes are effects on the\nskin.\nHere are but a few examples of drugs which produce drug rashes:\nAntipyrine: Papular, erythematous rash, sometimes accompanied by edema and much irritation.\nArsenic: Papular or erythematous rash, sometimes urticarial. Prolonged use may produce pigmentation\nof skin.\nBelladonna: Erythematous rash, usually accompanied by intense itching.\nBromides: Usually like acne vulgaris. Sometimes erythema.\nChloral: Papular erythema.\nIodides: Usually papular erythema, sometimes with acne-like pustules.\nPhenolphthalein: Macular rash, sometimes purpuric.\nQuinine: Very irritable erythema or urticaria.\nSalicylate: Erythematous rash, possibly morbilliform.\nSerum: Usually urticaria.\nSulfonal: Erythematous or urticarial rash.\nHere are some other drugs which produce skin rashes: opium compounds, acetanilide, amidopyrine,\nbarbiturates, ephedrine, novocain, sulfanilamide, and other sulfa drugs.\nSome of the drugs have been given very nice-sounding names, but note the chemicals in them: calomel\n(mercurous chloride), green vitriol (ferrous sulfate), goulard water (lead lotion), oil of vitriol (sulfuric\nacid), and vermilion (mercury sulfide). Most drugs are compounded from, not two but, a wide range of\nextremely complex and very poisonous chemical mixtures.\nLet it be emphasized that most drugs work their damage in a thousand other ways in the body, without\nproducing skin rashes."},{"id":"disease-skin-fasting","title":"Fasting","lang":"en","text":"You should be aware of the fact that, by the time symptoms of pain accompany cancer, it is in the\nadvanced stages. At that point, the body urgently needs good nourishment, as well as cleansing; it should\nnot be given fasts. For further information on this, see the Gerson Therapy, later in this book.\nBut, as a cancer preventative, occasional fasting is helpful. Cancer prevention is theme of this entire Part\nOne section of this book.\n• Fasts on fruit and vegetable juices of 1 to 3 days can be taken. If under the care of someone who\nknows what to do, and you are not thin, a longer fast may be undertaken.\n• Go on a fresh fruit diet for several days. If the patient is thin, after a few days of fruit diet, give him\nan alkaline nourishing diet. This would consist of vegetable broth (simmer thick potato peelings,\ncarrots, and beets; strain; drink the water on top), mashed half-inch thick potato peelings, brown rice,\ncarrots, greens of all kinds, red cabbage, parsley, and other vegetables.\n• Eating good food treats malnutrition, and many people develop cancer because of a lack of the\nprotective, nourishing food needed to resist it.\n• There is a theory that you can starve cancer to death. This has been proven untrue. Cancer does better\nin a malnourished body.

Do not eat chocolate or cocoa.\n• Drink 6-8 ounces of distilled water every hour.\n• Watermelon and pumpkin seeds seem to help the kidneys, although the reason is not\nknown.\n• Corn-silk tea is the best single herb for increasing urine flow and restoring the kidneys.\nWatermelon-seed tea and celery and parsley seeds are also diuretic in function.\n• Cranberries help acidify the urine, destroy bacteria, and restore the bladder.\n• Do not eat much potassium or phosphorous. For this reason, avoid beet greens, spinach,\nrhubarb, and Swiss chard.\n• Lead, other metals, the pain relieving drugs (Advil, Nuprin, etc.), and infectious diseases\n(scarlet fever, measles, etc.) can damage the kidneys.

These include:\nRenal tubular acidosis: The kidneys fail to reabsorb bicarbonate properly, resulting in inadequate\nammonia production and acid excretion. This leads to a severe lack of fluid and potassium in the body,\nand an excess of acidity. The bones can become deranged.\nHydronephrosis: The kidneys and bladder become filled with urine, due to obstruction of the flow.\nGlomerulonephritis: This is an inflammation of the tiny kidney filtering units, sometimes resulting from\na bacterial infection in the body.\nUremia: A toxic waste buildup in the blood, due to kidney malfunction.\nIn all of these conditions, a basic need is to cleanse the kidneys, increase urine flow, and restore proper\nfunction."},{"id":"disease-urinary-renal-colic","title":"Renal Colic","lang":"en","text":"Treatment\n\n• Drink plenty of pure water.

Thousands of tiny cells in the kidneys filter\nfluids out of the blood in order to purify it. But the filter can become plugged with toxins and mucous.\nWhen these tiny cells become swollen and inflamed, infection soon follows.\nThis infection can be acute or chronic, and may require hospitalization.\nConstipation causes a toxic matter to be reabsorbed by the blood. This clogs the kidneys.\nOveruse of aspirin and other pain killers weaken the kidneys; beer can cause their failure. Environmental\ntoxins, such as heavy metals, add to the damage. Anti-hypertensive drugs are used to reduce blood\ncirculation, and therefore injure the kidneys.\nKidney infection can also be caused by bacterial infection in the bladder (cystitis, which see) which has\ntraveled up the ureters to the kidneys.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere may be no symptoms or they may include blood and/or albumin in the urine and\nlower back, abdominal pain, even chills, fatigue, edema, nausea and vomiting, frequent urge to urinate,\nand loss of appetite.

See \"Nephritis\" (kidney infection) for\nmuch more information on the proper care and healing of the urinary tract. The bladder\nand kidneys are closely associated; whatever helps one helps the other.\n• Acidify the urine by drinking 1-2 quarts of cranberry juice per day, for the first day, and\n1 quart a day thereafter while the crisis continues.\n• Helpful herbs include juniper, lovage, parsley, uva ursi, rupturewort, bearberry, birch,\nand prickly restharrow. Of course, do not add sweetener or milk to the tea.\n• Drink tea made from 2-3 crushed or blended garlic bulbs several times a day.\n• The use of aluminum cookware is another cause of cystic symptoms. Avoid zinc and\niron supplements until this problem is healed.\n• Potassium deficiencies can lead to renal (kidney) disorders.\n• To relieve the pain and encourage healing, take hot sitz (sitting) baths twice a day, for 20\nminutes. To one of those daily sitz baths, add 1 cup of vinegar. The next day, add 2 cloves\ncrushed garlic or garlic juice to the water of one of the two baths.\n• A hot water bottle placed in direct contact to the urethral and vaginal openings may be\nextremely helpful in reducing pain. A heat lamp can also be used.\n• Women should especially avoid bacterial infection ascending into the bladder: The\nurinary outlet of the urethra is close to the vagina. When sexual intercourse is not done\nwith clean hands or too frequently, germs are more likely to enter the urethra. Wipe from\nfront to back following bowel movements, urinate before and after intercourse, and wear\ncotton underclothing (it lets air through and absorbs moisture better). Avoid douches,\nhygiene sprays, bubble baths, soap in the bath water, and nylon clothing. Wash carefully\nduring the monthly, to avoid bacteria from going up the urethra. Do not use tampons if\nthere are frequent urinary tract infections. Rinse underwear well, to get all the soap out.\nBoil panties in plain water. Shower after bathing in a swimming pool. Dress to keep the\nextremities warm; cold extremities weaken the trunk organs, including the urinary tract.\nBirth control pills and spermaticides may cause cystitis.\n—See \"Cystitis—2.\"\nHYDRO—Here are several hydrotherapy applications found in the author's book, Water Therapy\nManual (see order sheet):\nBladder atony: Ascending Douche.

Do not expose them to the sunlight for long periods of time. 2 - Weight factor: Larger persons require larger dosages than smaller or underweight individuals. Women generally require smaller doses than men, due to their lower average weight. Children and elderly people need smaller doses. 3 - Climate: The medicinal effect of herbs is intensified in hot climates, therefore give less at such times. 4 - People vary in their reactions: Some people are more intolerant to herbs than are others. It is best to initially give a smaller dose and see what the effect is going to be. It is always safe to start with the smaller child's dose, then build up to a larger dose if that seems best. Increase slowly, remaining on each level for 2-3 days, to observe for unusual reactions. 5 - Dosage for children: Here is the formula: Divide 150 (the assumed average adult weight) by the child's weight. Example: A child weighs 50 pounds. This is 1/3 of the adult (of 150 pounds.). Therefore give him only a third of the regular dose. 6 - During pregnancy: Women respond to herbs differently when they are pregnant. At such times, it is best to give smaller herbal doses and observe response. Sometimes mild and nutritive herbs are best. Some herbs should not be given during pregnancy (including diuretics, purgatives, and emmenagogues; all of which are active in the pelvic area and should be avoided.) 7 - Nervous people: Give them smaller doses than robust individuals. 8 - High blood pressure: These people should avoid herbs that stimulate the heart or constrict the blood capillaries and arteries (licorice root, ephedra, and lily of the valley are examples). But cayenne and garlic can be used in normal amounts. 9 - When herbs are combined: Herbs are frequently combined; but, if not done properly, one herb may overpower or neutralize the effects of others. 10 - Laxative herbs: Give slow-acting laxatives in the morning, so not to disturb sleep. They may take 1- 3 days to work; whereas fast-acting ones usually take 4-8 hours. Do not increase the dosage until a 3-day period is over, using the same dosage every day. Then, if the desired result is not obtained, you may increase the dosage. The desired objective is generally 2 bowel movements a day. 11 - Sedatives and antispasmodic herbs: Give them on an empty stomach or just before bedtime. 12 - Astringents and minerals: Astringent herbs should not be taken at the same time as nutritional supplements containing iron. The tannins in astringent herbs will leach calcium, iron, and other important minerals out of the intestines. Therefore, only give astringent herbs for a short period of time. 13 - Blood-purifying herbs: Take these herbs on an empty stomach. 14 - Strong, bitter herbs: To avoid nausea, be sure and give enough water with them. 15 - Powerful herbs: Be careful in giving herbs which have powerful effects. These include lobelia, juniper berries, black cohosh, poke root, aconite, and horsetail (shave grass). 16 - Bitter pills: They have a tonic effect on the stomach, digestion, and related organs. 17 - Herbal temperatures: A hot infusion or decoction is used to help induce sweating. Cool teas are used for tonic effect, and warm teas produce a feeling of relaxation. (Vervain is the best for inducing sweating.) 18 - Tablets vs. capsules: Tablets are easier to work with than capsules in hot climates; the latter tend to stick together. Vegetarians either open and empty capsules or use tablets, since capsules are made from slaughterhouse products. 19 - Herbs at mealtime: To avoid taking too much liquid, capsules or tablets are preferable to teas at mealtime. 20 - Varying the intensity of the dosage: Here are several principles to keep in mind:\n• For a slow, gradual, general effect, give the herbs in small quantities of syrup or milk\nbetween meals. This will retard absorption.\n• To aid the appetite, increase digestive secretions or, for a local effect on stomach or\nintestines, give herbs before meals. Give the herbs in acacia gum or olive oil for a localized effect on stomach or intestines.\n• To reduce the irritation of certain herbs, give them in syrup or soy milk.\n• To increase absorption of the herbs and produce a more rapid effect, give them 1-2 hours\nafter the meal.\n• To reduce the bitter taste of herbs, without reducing the bitterness, take it in a large\nquantity of fluid, syrup, or honey. The bitter taste is often necessary for the proper effect to take place, but the bitterness can be disguised to the taste buds.\n• Fluids which do not taste good can be taken more easily by drinking them cold, followed\nby a drink of plain water. 21 - Weekly rest day: In order for herbs to work best, they should not be taken one day each week. Then, after 2-3 weeks of treatment, no herbs should be taken for 3 days in a row. During this rest period, observe the patient. (1) If his energy remains low during that time or if the symptoms worsen, at the end of the rest period put him back on the herb dosage. (2) If he improves during the rest period, then extend the rest period a day or so and then continue the treatment with smaller doses than were used before. (3) If he seems to completely recover during the rest period, then the treatment can be changed to a more tonic, nutritive, approach. (4) New symptoms or problems may reveal themselves at this time. If so, an herb formula or new therapy should be instituted to meet it. (5) If he seems to get stronger during each rest period, begin reducing therapy and extending the rest periods."},{"id":"herb-the-preparation-of-herbs","title":"The Preparation Of Herbs","lang":"en","text":"1 - Infusion: Pour one pint of boiling water over one ounce of dried herbs and let it stand for a half hour.

During the healing process, the body tries to throw off toxins and poisons. What is known as the \"healing crisis\" frequently occurs in illnesses. The body seems overwhelmed with all the toxins and wastes it is trying to throw off. The organs of elimination (bowels, kidneys, lungs, skin, nasal passages, throat, bronchi, and urinary organs) become congested, crowded, and irritated. During this crisis, that which appears to be disease symptoms appear. These may be open sores, perspiration, diarrhea, boils, colds, kidney and bladder infections, fevers, etc. But this is not a new, or intensified, disease—it is just part of the healing process. The body knows it must eliminate the wastes before it can begin rebuilding, so it works valiantly to do this. Physicians sometimes try to stop the process by introducing poisons (drugs) into the system. Immediately, the body stops throwing off wastes—stops the crisis—and turns its attention to the terrible new invader. The body may appear to be resting quietly now, with the symptoms reduced or gone; but, in actuality, it has been prostrated by the drugging. Let us now return to a healing crisis and its symptoms. They are part of the cure, and should not be feared. Just work with the body, to help eliminate those toxic wastes. Open the channels of elimination by means of drinking water and fruit juices, fasting, enemas, colonics, showers, baths, and water treatments. Sometimes the pain becomes severe during the crisis. Drugs taken in earlier years are being pulled out of the tissues in an effort to discard. The damage of many years is being righted. The body arouses itself in self-defense and brings forth acute elimination of toxins in the form of a fever, cold, inflammations, itching, boils, ulcers, hemorrhages, excessive menstrual discharge, etc. Reactions vary, in accordance with how the person has been living and the condition of the body. But sometimes this sudden turn in an illness is not a healing crisis, but a change for the worse in a disease. It is important to be able to tell the difference. Consider this:\n• Watch the person carefully, as you work earnestly to help him eliminate toxins (water,\njuices, enemas, sweating, baths, etc.) If not watched properly and helped, the crisis can be extended and his energies weakened.\n• If it is a healing crisis, you will generally see a positive change—a change for the\nbetter—after three days. The most severe symptoms begin to decrease. Fevers break. The person becomes more relaxed and begins to feel better.\n• But if, after three days, the symptoms do not change for the better, then a new course of\ntreatment must be started. However, if the person has low energy and vitality, the crisis may take three to seven days.\n• If the individual has a strong constitution and the organs of elimination are working well\nand are being helped, he may recover without having undergone a healing crisis. Are there ways to tell when a healing crisis is about to begin? Certain symptoms will intensify, such as sluggishness, fevers, dark urine, coated tongue, weakness, irritability, headaches, and ringing in the ears. When you see these signs, immediately set to work to help the person's system cleanse more fully. Herbs, massage, water therapy treatments, and enemas can help him through this time. If no poisons were introduced into the system (in an effort to block the healing crisis) the person will generally keep improving. Right living, right eating, and rest can bring healing. Additional healing crises may occur before the patient is fully recovered. Each one will generally be milder, only one to three days in length, and be followed by a new level of feeling better. The intensity of the crisis will depend on how ill the person was. The nature of the crisis will be keyed to where the illness is centered in his body and how easily he can throw off the poisons. If the wastes can be eliminated through normal pathways, a fever will develop to burn it out or store it as boils and acne. If the mucous is thick, there will be nasal drip, colds, flu, etc. Constipation may precede diarrhea; lung congestion may come before a respiratory crisis. Sometimes we feel pain in our kidneys, bladder, or bowels and imagine it is a disease. But, in fact, often the body has selected the strongest organ of elimination to throw off unwanted and excess wastes. When the crisis is over, the body needs help rebuilding itself. But, throughout the sickness and recovery, never go to extremes in diet. Carry on with a gradual transition back to regular living. Trying to make the system too pure too fast can overly weaken the patient. Work carefully, keep praying for guidance; and, if the patient fully cooperates, all will go well."},{"id":"herb-water-therapy-principles","title":"Water Therapy Principles","lang":"en","text":"It would be well to include instruction here on how to give simple water treatments; but, like herbal lore, it cannot be properly covered in a few pages. The present author wrote a 290-page book, entitled The Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), which nicely covers the subject. You may obtain a copy, as long as they are available. Here are but a few of the many water therapy principles:\n• It is the heat and cold of the water that produces the results. Neutral temperatures are\ngood for relaxing the person, but they do not produce the powerful effects that hot and cold can give.\n• Water is capable of absorbing and storing a larger amount of heat than nearly any other\nsubstance on earth; that is, it has a high specific heat. This means that, when water is applied to the body (in a cloth, bath, shower, etc.), it will impart more heat (or cold) than any other substance at the same temperature.\n• In its effects, ice is far colder than its temperature of 32o F., and steam is far hotter than\n212o F. (Keep in mind that steam can burn.)\n• Water must be in contact with the body for awhile in order to impart heat or cold. But it\nonly need contact it for a moment to give a thermic impression that can be quite strong. For example, plunge your arm for only a moment into a pail of very cold water. It was only there for a moment, but the effect on the circulating blood in the arm will be powerful. This is thermic impression, and it is very important. You do not have to cool the body with lengthy cold in order to have it react strongly to that cold.\n• Water is the world's greatest solvent. It can cleanse better than anything else. It can\nremove wastes. But it can also hold nutrients placed within it for the body to absorb.\n• Neither infants nor aged persons bear cold treatment well. Some chill after almost any\nkind of cold application. Remember that they are only being helped if they react well to the cold application. If they do not, then they are not being helped. Conditions which do not react well to cold would include anemia, emaciation, asthenia, extreme thinness, etc. If a person cannot be benefited by cold, then apply mild heat instead. Always keep the feet warm.\n• The body should be warm before the cold is applied. He should become warm afterward.\nExercise, friction, percussion—all help bring a good reaction. Hot given beforehand to warm the body also aids it. You may need to apply hot to the feet before the cold is given, and, if need be, afterward also.\n• The cold treatment should be given quickly. As soon as it is completed, quickly dry him.\nFriction as he is rubbed with the towel, or afterward, will also help warm him. He must be dried very quickly and well. Dry him in a warm room, near where the last cold application was given. Have his clothes all ready for him to put on. This requires advance planning. Carelessness after the cold can undo all the value that could have been gained from it.\n• By alternating the hot and cold applications, the beneficial properties of both may be\nobtained without many of the disadvantages of either. As you become acquainted with the many water therapies given in the author's book, The Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), you will notice that they tend to do one or more of six things:\n• Bring blood to an afflicted part. This will frequently be an area closer to the surface and\noutside of the trunk.\n• Pull blood from a deeper internal organ to the skin just above it. This deeper, congested,\narea is often in the trunk, and the hot application (or a cold-to-heating application) was placed on the skin just above that organ.\n• Draw blood away from a deeper, congested, organ by placing the application, not on the\nskin just above the internal organ,—but on a reflex area somewhere else on the body.\n• Pull blood from the internal organ to a distant body part (usually the legs and/or\nfeet—best both). This is called derivation, and is frequently done at the same time that an application is made just above the internal organ (or to a reflex area connected to it by nerves), to also pull blood away from that congested organ.\n• A proximal compress, consisting of a cold application, may be placed on an extremity.\nAn example would be an ice compress around the neck. This will greatly reduce the amount of blood flowing into the head.\n• A full application to most of the body to relieve congestion, equalize the circulation, and\nbring warmth from that application (a hot pack, apply heat) or by reaction to it (a heating compress, applying cold for the body to heat). There are many additional guiding principles involved in the use of water therapy. Water is a most precious gift from God. Make good use of it, in both sickness and in health. HYDRO—When HYDRO is shown at the beginning of a paragraph, it refers to water treatments in the author's hydrotherapy book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet). In case you do not have that book, the name of the water treatments are given. But page numbers are also cited, so you can learn more about how to give these applications if you have that book. Only a very small sampling of the water treatments described in that book are mentioned in this one. Many more could have been included, but this present book would have become too large."},{"id":"herb-the-use-of-drugs","title":"The Use Of Drugs","lang":"en","text":"The following analysis of the nature and effects of medicinal drug medication is taken from the writings of Ellen G. White, an influential author and worker in the field of health and natural healing. She was also the founder of a major medical college. \"Drugs never cure disease; they only change its form and location . . When drugs are introduced into the system, for a time they seem to have a beneficial effect. A change may take place, but the disease is not cured. It will manifest itself in some other form . . The disease which the drug was given to cure may disappear, but only to reappear in a new form, such as skin diseases, ulcers, painful diseased joints, and sometimes in a more dangerous and deadly form . . Nature keeps struggling, and the patient suffers with different ailments, until there is a sudden breaking down in her efforts, and death follows.\"—How to Live, 60. \"Although the patient may recover, yet the powerful effort nature was required to make to overcome the poison, injured the constitution and shortened the life of the patient. There are many who do not die under the influence of drugs, but there are very many who are left useless wrecks, hopeless, gloomy, and miserable sufferers, a burden to themselves and to society.\"—How to Live, 50. \"Every additional drug given to the patient . . will complicate the case, and make the patient's recovery more hopeless . . An evil, simple in the beginning, which nature aroused herself to overcome, and which she would have done if left to herself, aided by the common blessings of Heaven, has been made tenfold worse by introducing drug poisons into the system, which cause of themselves a destructive disease, forcing into extraordinary action the remaining life forces to war against and overcome the drug intruder.\"—How to Live, 57. \"There are more who die from the use of drugs than all who would have died of disease had nature been left to do her own work.\"—How to Live, 61. \"The endless variety of medicines in the market, the numerous advertisements of new drugs and mixtures, all of which claim to do wonderful cures, kill hundreds where they benefit one . . Yet people keep dosing, and continue to grow weaker until they die . . God's servants should not administer medicines which they know will leave behind injurious effects upon the system, even if they do relieve present suffering. Every poisonous preparation in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, taken into the system, will leave its wretched influence, affecting the liver and lungs, and deranging the system generally.\"—Facts of Faith, 140. \"Educate away from drugs, use them less and less, and spend more and more upon hygienic agencies. Nature will respond to God's remedies,—pure air, pure water, proper exercise, and a clear conscience.\"—Letter, 1888. \"A great amount of good can be done by enlightening all to whom we have access, as to the best means, not only of curing the sick, but of preventing disease and suffering. The physician who endeavors to enlighten his patients as to the nature and causes of their maladies, and to teach them how to avoid disease, may have up-hill work; but if he is a conscientious reformer, he will talk plainly of the ruinous effects of self-indulgence in eating, drinking, and dressing, of the overtaxation of the vital forces that has brought his patients where they are. He will not increase the evil by administering drugs till exhausted nature gives up the struggle, but will teach the patients how to form correct habits and to aid nature in her work of restoration by a wise use of her own remedies.\"—Christian Temperance, 121. \"In treating the sick, the physician will seek God for wisdom; then, instead of placing his dependence upon drugs and expecting that medicine will bring health to his patients, he will use nature's restoratives, and employ natural means whereby the sick may be aided to recover.\"—Healthful Living, 247-248. \"Let the instruction be given in simple words [such as hot water, charcoal, or catnip tea]. We have no need to use the many expressions used by worldly physicians which are so difficult to understand that they must be interpreted by physicians . . Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs.\"—Letter 82, 1908. \"Were I sick, I would just as soon call in a lawyer as a physician from among general practitioners. I would not touch their nostrums, to which they give Latin names. I am determined to know, in straight English, the name of everything that I introduce into my system.\"—Manuscript 86, 1897. \"Indulging in eating too frequently, and in too large quantities, overtaxes the digestive organs and produces a feverish state of the system. The blood becomes impure, and then diseases of various kinds occur. A physician is sent for, who prescribes some drug which gives present relief, but which does not cure the disease. It may change the form of the disease, but the real evil is increased ten-fold. Nature was doing her best to rid the system of an accumulation of impurities, and should she have been left to herself, aided by the common blessings of heaven, such as pure air and pure water, a speedy and safe cure could have been affected.\"—4 Spiritual Gifts, 133. \"Use nature's remedies,—water, sunshine, and fresh air. Do not use drugs. Drugs never heal; they only change the features of the disease.\"—Letter 116, 1903. \"Experimenting in drugs is a very expensive business . . Nothing should be put into the human system that will leave a baleful influence behind.\"—Medical Ministry, 228. \"Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs. They destroy the power of the patient to help himself. This power the patients are to be taught to exercise by learning to eat simple, healthful foods, by refusing to overload the stomach with a variety of foods at one meal. All these things should come into the education of the sick. Talks should be given showing how to preserve health, how to shun sickness, how to rest when rest is needed.\"—Letter 82, 1908. \"Christ's remedies cleanse the system. But Satan has tempted man to introduce into the system that which weakens the human machinery, clogging and destroying the fine, beautiful arrangements of God. The drugs administered to the sick do not restore, but destroy. Drugs never cure. Instead, they place in the system seeds which bear a very bitter harvest.\"—2 Selected Messages, 289. \"Thousands need to be educated patiently, kindly, tenderly, but decidedly, that nine-tenths of their complaints are created by their own course of action. The more they introduce drugs into the system, the more certainly do they interfere with the laws of nature and bring about the very difficulties they drug themselves to avoid.\"—Letter 22, 1889. \"Instead of taking a course to baffle disease, you are petting it and yielding to its power. You should avoid the use of drugs and carefully observe the laws of health. If you regard your life, you should eat plain food, prepared in the simplest manner, and take more physical exercise. Each member of the family needs the benefit of health reform. But drugging should be forever abandoned. For while it does not cure any malady, it enfeebles the system, making it more susceptible to disease.\"—5 Testimonies, 311. \"If those who take these drugs were alone the sufferers, the evil would not be as great. But parents not only sin against themselves in swallowing drug-poisons, but they sin against their children. The vitiated state of their blood, the poison distributed throughout the system, the broken constitutions and various drug diseases, as the result of drug poisons, are transmitted to their offspring, and left them as a wretched inheritance, which is another great cause of the degeneracy of the race.\"—How to Live, 53.

For more than two years, three scientists had worked toward this day, and now they were ready. Carefully, they climbed into the gondola of the balloon, \"Zenith,\" while thousands around them watched. Determined to set a new altitude record, they wanted to go higher than man had ever risen above the earth. And they did just that,—but at what a cost. Slowly the large balloon rose into the air, with its human cargo of three men in a basket-shaped gondola swinging just beneath it. All seemed well; they were well on their way toward the goal: to climb higher than any man had ever gone. Then at 24,430 feet it happened. Tissandier, one of the three, later described it: \"Croce is gasping for breath, Sivel is dazed, but can still cut three sandbags loose in order to reach 26,240 feet.\" At that point, Tissandier himself was overcome and slumped to the floor, losing consciousness.

It may be golden in color, but the sulphur is not good inside of you."},{"id":"principle-vegetables","title":"Vegetables","lang":"en","text":"1 - The best is fresh, raw, vegetable juice, made from carrots, with some beets, and possibly some celery. This is made in a vegetable juicing machine. It is one of the most valuable appliances you can purchase. Use it every day. The juice is best drunk fresh, within a couple minutes of making it. But, when you know you will be away from home that day, make it in the morning and drink it later as part of a sack lunch. 2 - Also good is the \"green drink.\" This is pineapple juice with some greens whizzed in and is made in a food blender. 3 - Some people's digestive systems cannot tolerate a diet of totally raw vegetables. Each must do that which works best for him. 4 - Eat largely of raw vegetables, with possibly some steamed. A good way to cook vegetables is to keep records on the amount of water used and the time it takes to cook the vegetables, so all the water is gone. For example, broccoli can be lightly cooked for 15 minutes or softer in 30. Find how much water is required to do this, and only have a very small amount of water left in the pan at the end of that time. 5 - Never pour off the vegetable water! Make it part of the meal. For this reason, prepare the food so that very little of the water remains (not over an eighth of a cup) when the cooking is finished. Then drink that water during the meal. Other than the cooking water and a glass of fresh juice, drink no other liquids with the meal. 6 - Beets, potatoes, and squash are excellent foods. Cut out the growing eyes of the white potatoes, but otherwise do not peel them! The outer half inch of the white potato is rich in potassium and is the best part. 7 - All the greens are outstanding, but avoid too much spinach; it is higher in oxalic acid. Enjoy broccoli, Brussel sprouts, celery, kale, collards, beet greens, turnip greens, mustard greens, and some lettuce. The deeper the greenness, the more vitamins and minerals it has. (By the way, never eat rhubarb; it is terribly high in oxalic acid which leaches calcium from your bones.) 8 - Fiber is very important in the diet, for the bowels and the arteries. It can protect you from intestinal problems and heart disease. Oat bran is the best, but whole grains and other vegetable and fruit roughage is very helpful."},{"id":"principle-grains","title":"Grains","lang":"en","text":"1 - Only eat whole grains. This includes whole-grain cereals and breads. Never eat processed grains, such as white-flour products. 2 - If you can eat wheat (many cannot), make zwieback of your bread. Place the slices in the oven and toast them until firm, but not rock-hard. This dextrinizes the starch and renders it more digestible. 3 - Avoid toasted wheat germ, for the oils in it will be rancid. Raw wheat germ should be stored in the refrigerator at the health food store and in your own refrigerator, when you arrive home. It should smell very fresh. 4 - Oats is one of the best grains. Rye, millet, and buckwheat are also. If you are out on the road and want to have a grain with you which is easily obtained, can be eaten as it is, and is very nourishing, eat Cheerios. Make sure it was recently purchased. Many people are allergic to wheat and products made with wheat. 5 - You are better off having a varied grain diet rather than just rice. Yet rice is a very good food. Make sure it is unpolished (brown rice). 6 - Chew each bite of grain products very well before swallowing. Digestion of starches begins in the mouth."},{"id":"principle-nuts-and-seeds","title":"Nuts And Seeds","lang":"en","text":"1 - The nuts and seeds you eat should be fresh. Rancid oil and decaying protein are not good for you. 2 - Nuts, seeds, nut butters, seed butters, and peanut butter are very rich in protein and should only be eaten sparingly. Chew these foods very well. This breaks the food down so the amino acids will be better processed by the stomach acid. 3 - Most commercial peanut butter has the peanut oil removed, and cheap oils in its place. These oils are generally hydrogenated, and thus even more dangerous. Never use peanut butter which does not have floating oil on the top and does not smell fresh."},{"id":"principle-fats","title":"Fats","lang":"en","text":"According to your body's needs, use little or no added oil.

Some say that all the salt you need is in the food, but that may or may not be true. You may need to add a little salt, but do not add very much. The best way is to put no salt in the cooking; then add a slight amount of salt to the food at the table. Pour a little into the palm of your hand and sprinkle it where you want it. In this way you will get the exact small amount you need, and no more. 2 - The type of salt to use: Regular store-bought, free-flowing salt has aluminum in it. If you cannot do better, buy iodized salt at the store (never non-iodized). Better yet, buy a non-free-flowing salt. It will cake somewhat (salt attracts moisture). Even better, use dulse or kelp! 3 - Nova Scotia dulse comes from western Canada. By checking around, you can locate a food source. This is an outstanding source of trace minerals—including iodine, as well as of common salt (sodium chloride). Eat only enough to satisfy your salt intake needs,—and you will have supplied all your iodine and trace mineral requirements as well. Norwegian kelp is an alternate. California kelp is not as good. 4 - Certain kitchen herbs are helpful; and, when used in small amounts, they can be used to flavor foods. This would include sage, dill, garlic powder, dried parsley, thyme, fennel seed, celery seed, oregano, marjoram, summer savory, basil, rosemary, and ginger. 5 - Cayenne is a very useful medicinal herb; but, if used more than a very little at mealtime, this can lead to pleurisy."},{"id":"principle-vitamins-and-minerals","title":"Vitamins And Minerals","lang":"en","text":"Here is a brief introduction to principles concerning the use of vitamins and minerals. 1 - Always take a full vitamin/mineral supplement with every main meal. Buy them from a source you are sure is supplying you with new stock, that has not been on a room temperature shelf for a month or two. Keep the bottle in the refrigerator until it is used. 2 - Vitamin A: Unless you are ill and need it right away, use a carotene source, not vitamin A. Because it is an oil-soluble vitamin, over a period of time, you can get too much vitamin A. 3 - Vitamin B complex: The complete B complex contains a dozen or so different, related, vitamins. Make sure you are getting them all in your supplement(s). These are water soluble, so you can never get too much of them. 4 - Vitamin C: Ascorbic acid by itself is not as useful as many believe. Take a \"total C\" formula, which also contains bioflavonoids (vitamin P). You will pay a little more, but it is worth it. It is also water soluble, so you cannot take too much. (If you oversaturate on C, the excess will be excreted through the bowels as a brief diarrhea. This will tell you that, just then, you have taken a little more than your body needs. This is what it means to take vitamin C \"to bowel tolerance.\") 5 - Vitamin D: Do not take animal or fish liver oil; it can damage your heart muscle. Instead, go out in the sunlight every so often and you will get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D is oil soluble and is the most dangerous vitamin. It is vital that you have some of this for your bones, but you do not want too much. 6 - Vitamin E: Make sure your vitamin E supplement says \"tocopherols,\" not \"tocopheryls\" which is synthetic and worthless. Do not rely on a multivitamin supplement for vitamin E. Take vitamin E capsules, either 200 or 400 IU per capsule. Although it is oil soluble, the possibility of overdosing is rare in the extreme. 7 - Vitamin F: This is your essential fatty acids, which is best obtained from the flaxseed oil or wheat germ oil, mentioned earlier. 8 - The most important minerals are calcium, potassium, magnesium, iodine, zinc, selenium, and manganese. Avoid phosphorus supplements. Your body always gets all the phosphorus it needs in the food you eat; too much locks with calcium and causes your bones to become weak. 9 - Most people need a calcium supplement. Take half a spoonful of powdered calcium twice or three times a day. Do not use a calcium supplement which has phosphorus in it. 10 - Be careful about iron supplements. They are generally not good for you. Especially avoid them during pregnancy! Use blackstrap instead. 11 - What about the capsules? They are made from animals from the slaughterhouse, generally pigs. If it is a split capsule, open and pour it into a spoon. If it is a sealed capsule, crack it in your mouth and spit out the capsule."},{"id":"principle-summary","title":"Summary","lang":"en","text":"In summary, some of the best foods for you to eat are these: 1 - Fresh, raw, fruits. You may also wish to make some fresh, raw fruit juice. 2 - Fresh, raw, vegetables and, possibly, some moderately cooked vegetables prepared in a small amount of water, all of which will be used in the meal. 3 - Fresh, raw, vegetable juices made from carrots, beets, and possibly some celery. This drink is outstanding! Green drink (pineapple juice and greens) made in a blender is also good. 4 - Beets, potatoes, and squash are excellent foods. Do not peel white potatoes. 5 - Whole grain cereals or bread toasted in the oven into zwieback. Chew starches extra well. 6 - Add some supplemental fiber to your diet. You will be thankful later that you did. Fiber will help your digestive tract, colon, liver, heart, and blood vessels. 7 - A few fresh nuts and seeds, chewed extra well. Brewer's yeast is another good protein source; so are beans. White potatoes are low in protein, but they are very well-assimilated. 8 - A good vitamin/mineral supplement, vitamin E capsules, calcium, plus other nutrients as needed. Each person will have special needs. 9 - Eat some kelp or dulse each day for iodine and other trace minerals. You do well to use it instead of salt. 10 - Drink pure water, and only between meals. 11 - Should you use milk and/or eggs? Each one will have to decide that for himself. Both are known to frequently be contaminated with disease germs. Yet some need the blood-building properties in these products. It is well-known that more people are allergic to cow's milk or wheat than anything else. It is best if you can work away from using them. 12 - Do not eat very much. Be relaxed and thankful, chew your food well; and, aside from the fresh juices or green drink, drink all your liquids (water) between meals."},{"id":"principle-things-to-avoid","title":"Things To Avoid","lang":"en","text":"\"Avoid\" means do not use at all. 1 - Avoid sugar and sugar foods. This is food which has added corn syrup, glucose, or other sugar additives in it. Many canned and processed foods are sugar foods. Do not eat candy. 2 - Do not use white sugar, granulated sugar, or brown sugar. 3 - Avoid spices and condiments which cause stomach upset and worse. This would include black pepper, white pepper, cinnamon, and mustard. 4 - Avoid grease. Grease remains firm at room temperature, and includes Crisco, butter, margarine, and all meat fat. 5 - Avoid hydrogenated oils. An atom of hydrogen has been added to them; so, like grease, they can only be used to coat your arteries and produce fat cells. 6 - Do not use fried foods. Anything fried in oil should be avoided. Your life is too important. 7 - Avoid rich gravies, pastries, ice cream, and all the other delicacies. 8 - Avoid white-flour products: cookies, biscuits, sour bread, bagels, doughnuts, soda crackers, etc. Avoid the glue foods. Along with cheese, these are the sticky, white-flour stuff which is hard on your intestinal tract 9 - Avoid processed foods. This includes a wide variety of \"food\" which you will find in the store. 10 - Do not eat cheese. In order to normalize your intestinal flora, you may need a little plain yogurt for a time. 11 - Do not eat baker's yeast. This is fresh bread yeast. (Brewer's yeast and torula yeast is all right.) 12 - Avoid junk food and no-food. This includes soft drinks, cola drinks, potato chips, corn chips, and all the rest. Do not drink non-caffeinated soft drinks. 13 - Do not eat vinegar or foods made with it (pickles and mayonnaise). 14 - Never eat meat or fish! They are heavily contaminated with bacteria, parasites, dangerous fat, and uric acid (urine). As soon as they are slain, the flesh begins rotting. 15 - Avoid the food additives. You will find them listed on the labels of most all processed foods at the store. They lead to arthritic, cardiac, and cancer problems. 16 - Many people are allergic to cow's milk; you may be one of them. Every public health officer knows that meat and milk are the two most contaminated and diseased foods in the country. Eggs rank close behind them. It is best to avoid them also. 17 - Do not use caffeine products. This includes chocolate, coffee, China tea (also called black tea), and caffeinated drinks, such as Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola. 18 - Do not use nicotine products. Tobacco is responsible for an astonishing number of deaths in our world today. Avoid side smoke; do not be in rooms where people are smoking. Chewing snuff causes cancer of the mouth and throat. 19 - Do not drink spiritous liquors: beer, wine, whiskey, or vodka. 20 - Do not use hard (street) drugs. 21 - Avoid medicinal drugs, to whatever extent that you can. Careful living and eating will generally help you avoid having to take them. 22 - Find the foods and other substances you are allergic to, and avoid them. The most common allergenic foods are cow's milk and wheat products."},{"id":"principle-non-dietetic-factors","title":"Non-Dietetic Factors","lang":"en","text":"1 - Obtain fresh air during the day and while sleeping at night. A slight current of air should pass through your sleeping room at night. When you have the opportunity to go outside, breathe deeply of the fresh air. Practice good posture at certain times. Negative ions are important for good health, and they are primarily outside the house. 2 - Sunlight is important. Get a little every day. There is a higher rate of breast cancer in localities where there is less sunlight. 3 - Exercise is important; and, as everybody says, walking outside is the best way to get it. If you are going to do vigorous exercise, warm up first. Do some vigorous walking every day. 4 - Rest is of vital consequence. As you grow older, try to rest a little before preparing the meal. Then, when the meal is over, go outside and walk around a little. 5 - Do not do heavy reading or study just before bedtime, or your brain will be congested and it will be harder to go to sleep. Instead, go outside and walk around in the cool night air, breathing deeply. You will more easily drop right off to sleep. 6 - Maintain a cheerful, sunny, thankful, contented attitude. This is a powerful health-building recipe. 7 - Trust in God; He is the only One who can help you through the problems and trials of life. 8 - You need periods of rest and relaxation every so often. Purposive living, when the objective is to help others, is powerful for good—and excellent for your health. But do not overwork. 9 - Cleanliness is important. Keep your yard clean, your house clean, your clothes clean, and your body clean. Wash the outside with water (take a shower every day), and wash the inside by drinking enough liquids. At certain times, take an enema or colonic when needed, especially when you are sick. Showers are generally better than tub baths; they are quicker and more sanitary. 10 - Do not wear belts, corsets, garters. The clothes should be supported from the shoulders, not at the waist. Men should wear suspenders as part of the way to avoid later prostate problems. 11 - The right exercise of the will is crucial. You are well, you become well, you resist disease, you choose not the wrong, and choose to do the right—through the power of the will, strengthened by firm reliance on God and obedience to His Written Word. 12 - As much as possible, live on a scheduled routine. In this way, you will get your meals, water, rest, exercise, and fresh air. You will have time to eat, to think, and make right decisions. Maintaining regular hours is a great benefit to health. Avoid staying up late at night! Use your will and go to bed when you are supposed to. 13 - Avoid chilling or overheating. Avoid drafts. The danger is in chilling or overheating the blood; either can cause trouble. Dress properly; keep the limbs covered. They should be as warm as the trunk. 14 - Fast occasionally. Skip a meal and just drink fruit or vegetable juice instead. If you are in good health, you can carry on your work on a lighter load till the next meal. If you are frail, go to bed and rest. This will do you wonders in rebuilding and strengthening your body, so you will avoid later development of chronic and degenerative diseases. 15 - Keep your blood circulation equalized. Do not chill the extremities. Do not overeat or eat wrong foods. Maintain moderate exercise. Do what it takes to live right, and you will be richly rewarded. 16 - Avoid anger, fear, worry, and enervation. An excellent way to ruin yourself is by indulging in excess sex or forbidden sex. Happiness comes through self-control, not indulgence. 17 - Never overdo your immune system. It protects you, only as you do not make it work too hard in the process. 18 - Do not overwork one body part more than the others. Many occupational injuries occur because this rule is violated. Take time to rest, when you are not busily working. Look a little closer at athletes, boxers, and karate experts. They are usually physically damaged in their joints by the time they are 50. This is not necessary. Live well by living moderately. Too much food, too much work, and too much relaxation can each be a problem. Learn to balance it all. 19 - Have a careful attitude. Avoid falls, blows, hazards, and dangerous activities. More quadriplegia occurs from diving into shallow water than any other single cause. Get extra rest when you work near sick people. 20 - Learn the distant early warning signs. What are the first indications that you are headed toward sickness? Find out what they are—for yourself, your loved ones, and your children. When you see trouble coming, get extra rest; retire earlier. Skip a meal or two, go to bed and fast on water and lemon juice. 21 - Automobiles are one of the most dangerous things in Western civilization. Treat them with care; avoid them as much as you can. Aside from gluttony, tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, they can maim or kill you faster than most anything in your environment. If you are trying to live healthfully, they are your primary danger of crippling or premature death. Drive carefully, always a distance from the car in front of you. Also be watchful of any situation in which cars are turning in or out. Twilight times, evenings, and night are the most dangerous. 22 - When able to do so, avoid jet lag and traveling in foreign countries. They have different intestinal bacteria, and you can surely get sick over there. 23 - Avoid loud sounds, such as chain saws and other loud machinery. Wear ear protectors. 24 - Avoid dust, smoke, and chemical vapors. 25 - Move out to the country, if you want the best of health! Away from the noise, the fumes, the rush and turmoil. Out to where there is quietness, peace, fresh air, negative ions, and better sunlight. 26 - Do not live in the lowlands, by a creek. Do not live where it is always damp around the house. Settle in an upper area where it tends to be drier. 27 - Do not have trees close to your house. Do not have your windows covered up with curtains; let the sunlight come through. It purifies every room it enters. Skylight is purifying also, but lesser so. 28 - Vegetable, fruit, berry, and flower gardening is an outstanding way to maintain your health—in several ways. But avoid using chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and other garden chemicals. 29 - Learn how to give water therapy (hydrotherapy) treatments. Learn how to prepare and use simple herbs. Keep a few on hand. As we try to help others, our own health improves."}]
