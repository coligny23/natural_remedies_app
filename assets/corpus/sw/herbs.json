    "contentEn": "A rather complete discussion of herbs had been planned for this book, but it will not be included for three reasons: First, there are many worthwhile herb books available. Second, to cover the subject properly (herbal preparation, properties, and contraindications) would require at least 75 pages, and this book is already too big now. But it did seem well to list the most important herbs and mention a few other basic facts. One problem with herbs is that few of us can afford to keep more than a small collection of them on hand. Since they are not used a lot, purchasing could be a problem, since they are likely to spoil before we used them up. So it would be well to know which ones are the most important! Here is a list prepared by the present writer. Read it, change the list around to suit your own family needs,—and then stock up on a few beneficial herbs, so you will have them on hand when you need them most. HERE ARE THE 12, 20, 50, AND 60 MOST IMPORTANT HERBS:",
    "contentSw": "Majadiliano kamili ya mimea yalikuwa yamepangwa kwa kitabu hiki, lakini haitajumuishwa kwa sababu tatu: kwanza, kuna vitabu vingi vya mimea vinavyopatikana. Pili, kufunika mada vizuri (maandalizi ya mitishamba, mali, na contraindication) itahitaji angalau kurasa 75, na kitabu hiki tayari ni kubwa sana sasa. Lakini ilionekana vizuri kuorodhesha mimea muhimu zaidi na kutaja ukweli mwingine wa msingi. Shida moja na mimea ni kwamba wachache wetu wanaweza kumudu kuweka zaidi ya mkusanyiko mdogo wao. Kwa kuwa hazitumiwi sana, ununuzi unaweza kuwa shida, kwani wanaweza kuharibu kabla hatujazitumia. Kwa hivyo itakuwa vizuri kujua ni ipi muhimu zaidi! Hapa kuna orodha iliyoandaliwa na mwandishi wa sasa. Soma, ubadilishe orodha ili kuendana na mahitaji ya familia yako mwenyewe, - kisha uweke mimea michache yenye faida, kwa hivyo utakuwa nazo wakati unazihitaji zaidi. Hapa kuna mimea 12, 20, 50, na 60 muhimu zaidi:",

    "contentEn": "1 - CHARCOAL—This is not an herb, yet it is invaluable in a number of ways. Charcoal is pure carbon, and will adsorb (not absorb) 29 of the 30 most dangerous poisons. You can drink it diluted in water, use it as a poultice on wounds, skin infections, etc. 2 - CAYENNE—Dr. Christopher, a well-known herbalist of the mid-20th century, said that if he only had two herbs, he would select charcoal and cayenne. Cayenne is powerful in its ability to attract blood to a body part. Since it is the blood which brings healing, this can be an important quality. Internally, it is useful for arteriosclerosis, arthritis, asthma, bleeding, high or low blood pressure, bronchitis, chills, colds, convulsions, coughs, indigestion, infections, jaundice, ulcers, and varicose veins. Externally, it is used for frostbite, painful joints, swellings, and varicose veins. When added to herbal formulas, it stimulates the action of other herbs. It is a preventative for heart attacks, flu, colds, indigestion, and lack of vitality. It is good for treating the spleen, pancreas, kidneys and is effective as a fomentation for rheumatism, inflammation, pleurisy, sores, and wounds. It can be rubbed on toothaches and swellings. 3 - GARLIC—This is one of the most powerful antiseptic substances ever discovered. In the 1950s, Soviet scientists found it to be equal to penicillin, yet without the harmful effects of that powerful drug. Internally, it is used for arteriosclerosis, cancer, contagious disease, coughs, cramps, diverticulitis, emphysema, gas, heart problems, high blood pressure, indigestion, liver congestion, parasites, rheumatism, sinus congestion, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for bowel problems, parasites, ringworm, skin parasites, tumors, warts, and yeast infections. Garlic is used for all lung and respiratory ailments, and can be used as a tea or added to syrups for coughs, colds, tuberculosis, fevers, and blood diseases. Use it as a tea in an enema for worms and bowel infections. Use the fresh extract oil or eat the raw cloves. 4 - GOLDENSEAL—This is another powerful antiseptic; and, in a sense, it is the first true herb on this list. (The first three can be purchased in the grocery store.) Internally, it is good for alcoholism, allergies, asthma, bad breath, bladder diseases, bronchitis, canker sores, chicken pox, colds, diabetes, eczema, bleeding gums or gum infections, hay fever, heart weakness, hemorrhoids, herpes, indigestion, infections, inflammations, leukorrhea, liver problems, lymph congestion, measles, mammary and ovarian tumors, morning sickness, sore mouth, pyorrhea, tonsillitis, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for burns, canker sores, eye inflammations, bleeding gums, gum infections, herpes sores, leukorrhea, mouth sores, ringworm, skin inflammation, tonsillitis, and wounds. Goldenseal can be used on open sores, inflammations, eczema, ringworm, erysipelas, or itchy skin conditions. It is a specific for all kinds of mucous membrane problems. Snuffed up the nose, it is good for nasal catarrh. Small doses will relieve nausea during pregnancy. It is a douche for vaginal infections, an eyewash, and an antiseptic mouthwash for pyorrhea. Used with cascara sagrada, it is a bowel tonic. As a retention enema, it will reduce swollen hemorrhoids. 5 - PEPPERMINT—This is an old household remedy, and is useful for a variety of conditions. Internally, it is useful for insomnia, measles, menstrual cramps, migraines, morning sickness, muscle spasms, nausea, nervous disorders, chills, colic, fevers, dizziness, gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysentery, and hysteria. Externally, it is used for skin itch, toothache, and local anesthetic to local pains and inflamed joints. For example, to open up the sinuses, put 5-10 drops into 2 quarts hot water and breathe it in through the mouth and nostrils. Cover the head with a cloth as you do this. 6 - SLIPPERY ELM—This is the inner white bark of the slippery elm tree, and is invaluable to keep on hand. (The outer dark bark is also sold, but is useless.) Internally, it is used for bladder inflammation, bronchitis, colitis, constipation, ovarian cramps, coughs, cystitis, diarrhea, diverticulitis, dysentery, eczema, flu, gas, hemorrhage, hemorrhoids, hoarseness, lung congestion, stomach problems, tonsillitis, ulcers. Externally, it is used for burns, colitis, constipation, diverticulitis, dysentery, gangrenous wounds, hemorrhoids, leukorrhea, open sores, rheumatoid and gouty afflictions, and wounds. Slippery elm is also used to bind materials of suppositories, boluses, lozenges, and unleavened breads together. It makes a nourishing gruel for children, for the elderly with weak stomachs, for those with ulcers and those who are recovering from diseases. If used as a douche or enema, it must be diluted with water so it will not plug the apparatus (since it is a mucilaginous herb). 7 - LOBELIA—This is both a relaxant and stimulant, and a powerful helper. Internally, it is used for allergies, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chicken pox, contagious diseases, convulsions, coughs, earache, ear infections, fevers (all kinds), headache, heart palpitation, indigestion, jaundice, pleurisy, pneumonia, food poisoning, St. Vitus dance, teething, toothache. Externally, it is used for snake and insect bites, poison ivy, ringworm, and tumors. Small doses of a tincture of lobelia (5-10 drops) will act as a tonic and stimulant; larger doses will act as a sedative. It relieves spasms and acts as an expectorant. It can be used as a wash on infected or itchy skin conditions. In large doses, it is an excellent emetic. It is especially good in spasmodic coughing of phlegm. Taken in small doses, it relaxes the heart and lowers rapid pulse. 8 - ALOE VERA—The gel from the leaves of this desert plant is invaluable. It is best used freshly picked from a plant. Keep several plants growing; you cannot have enough! Internally, it is good for chronic constipation, gastritis, hyperacidity, and stomach ulcers. Externally, it is used for abscesses, burns, infection in wounds, insect bites, skin irritations, and ulcers. When applied on the skin for severe burns and skin rashes, it can be left on for two days without changing the application. Do not use it during pregnancy, nor in large doses when there are hemorrhoids. 9 - CASCARA SAGRADA—This is one of the safest laxatives for chronic constipation, and is not habit forming. Internally, it is used for constipation, cough, gall bladder disease, gallstones, gastric and intestinal disorders, hemorrhoids, indigestion, and jaundice. 10 - CORN SILK—This is the best single herb for increasing urine flow, thus helping to eliminate kidney and bladder problems. Internally, it is used for bed-wetting, chronic cystitis, inflammation of kidneys and bladder, kidney stones, prostatitis, excess uric acid, and urine retention. It is a good remedy for all inflammatory conditions of the urethra, bladder, prostate, and kidney; it can remove gravel from the kidneys, bladder and prostate. It helps the aged when their urine is scanty and has heavy sediment. 11 - HOPS—This is an excellent nervine and will produce sleep when insomnia is present. But it also has other uses. Internally, it is used for coughs, fever, headaches, indigestion, insomnia, jaundice, morning sickness, weak nerves, stomach tonic, throat, bronchial tubes, chest ailments, toothache, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for boils, bruises, earaches, inflammations, rheumatic pains, skin ailments, and ulcers. The tea is good for nervous stomach, poor appetite, gas, and intestinal cramps. Cold tea before meals will increase digestion. The dry herb can be placed inside a pillow; it will induce sleep. 12 - WITCH HAZEL—This is an excellent astringent herb and is one of the best remedies for stopping excessive menstruation, hemorrhages from the lungs, stomach, uterus, and bowels. Internally, it is used for diarrhea, diphtheria, hemorrhoids, leukorrhea, prolapsed bowel, varicose veins, and uterine problems. It is used to stop bleeding from the lungs, uterus, and other internal organs. Externally, it is used for burns, bruises, diphtheria, insect bites, leukorrhea, sore breasts, sore muscles, tonsillitis, and varicose veins. Witch hazel can be used as an injection for bleeding piles, vaginal discharges, and infections. As either fomentation or poultice, it is good for wounds, bed sores, sore and inflamed eyes, and oozing skin diseases. It is good for almost any internal or external inflamed condition.",

    "title": "Most Important Herbs",
    "contentEn": "(A TOTAL OF TWENTY BASIC HERBS) Here are the next eight most important herbs. Added to the above, you will have the twenty most important herbs. 13 - CATNIP—This is wonderful for children and infants when gas, stomach cramps, or nervousness occur. This is the children's herb, but it is also helpful to grown-ups. Internally, it is used for colds, bronchitis, dizziness, fevers, gas, diarrhea, headaches, hysteria, insomnia, morning sickness, mumps, smallpox, and urine retention. Externally, it is used for constipation, mumps, and painful swellings. Use catnip as an enema to expel worms. Drink the tea for headaches caused by indigestion. 14 - COMFREY—This is an all-around good remedy. Internally, it is used for anemia, arthritis, asthma, internal bleeding, blood purifier, bronchitis, calcium deficiency, colitis, coughs, diarrhea, dysentery, emphysema, gall bladder inflammation. Externally, it is used for boils, bruises, burns, psoriasis, and sprains. Comfrey is excellent for dysentery; one of the best for internal bleeding; excellent for coughs; catarrh; ulcerated bowels, stomach, and lungs. Bruise the fresh leaves and apply as a poultice to wounds, burns, open sores, gangrene, and moist ulcers. The tea can also be put on them. Keep some growing in your garden. Once established, it will keep coming up year after year. 15 - ECHINACEA—This is a powerful blood cleanser, and is tolerated by the system in fairly large amounts. Internally, it is used for acne, bad breath, bladder infections, blood poisoning, blood purifier, boils, fevers, gangrene, infections, inflammation of mammary glands, intestinal antiseptic, leukopenia (reduction in blood leukocytes), lymphatic congestion, skin diseases, tonsillitis, uremic poisoning, and venereal disease. Externally, it is used for open wounds and painful swellings. Echinacea is an excellent antibiotic, and ranks with goldenseal and red clover. It has been used against syphilis and gonorrhea. 16 - FLAXSEED—This is even more mucilaginous than slippery elm and is good for a variety of problems. Internally, it is used for asthma, bronchitis, catarrh, constipation, coughs, diarrhea, enteritis, flatulence, hemorrhoids, lung and chest problems, pleurisy, and stomach ulcers. In poultices, flaxseed is excellent for sores, boils, inflammations, and tumors. Combine it with slippery elm for boils, oozing sores, and burns. It is also good for all intestinal inflammations. 17 - GINGER—This is good for bringing heat into the system, stimulating digestion, reversing suppressed menstruation, and scanty urine. Internally, it is used for colds, colon spasms, constipation, contagious diseases, coughs, cramps, indigestion, gas, headache, morning sickness, nausea, sinus congestion, and stomach spasms. Externally, it is used for mumps. Add it to laxative formulas to prevent griping. Taken in frequent doses, it will raise body temperature. 18 - MYRRH—This is a strong antiseptic, and works well with goldenseal. Mix them in equal parts. Internally, it is used for asthma, bad breath, boils, cankers, chronic catarrh, colitis, coughs, digestive tonic, bleeding gums, herpes, indigestion, infections, leukorrhea, mouth sores, skin disease, thrush, and ulcers. Externally, it is used for cankers, cuts, bleeding gums, leukorrhea, mouth sores, skin disease, thrush, and wounds. Myrrh destroys putrefaction in the intestines and prevents blood absorption of toxins. It is a good wash for wounds and skin diseases. The powder will dry up most skin problems. It is excellent for most problems involving pus, externally or internally. Do not use it in large amounts over a long period of time. 19 - SKULLCAP—This is very good for almost any nervous problem. Internally, it is used for alcoholism, convulsions, coughs, epilepsy, hysteria, indigestion, insanity, insomnia, nervous tension, and nervous headache. Skullcap has been used to wean people off hard drugs. Combined with ginseng, it is good for alcoholism. Skullcap should be used as fresh as possible, otherwise its activity rather quickly dissipates. 20 - VERVAIN—This is excellent for inducing sweating and to allay fevers (but large amounts will act as an emetic). Internally, it is used for colds, convulsions, coughs, fevers, headaches, measles, nerve weakness, pain in the bowels, and pleurisy. Externally, it is used for rheumatism, neuralgia, sciatica, and swellings of the spleen. Vervain is good for pneumonia, asthma, and other chest diseases. Put the tea on sores, to aid in healing. Use it for colds, flu, coughs, and upper respiratory inflammations. Now you have the basis for a fine, basic herbal cabinet! Twelve or twenty herbs are good numbers to work with, in keeping your basic herb supply small. If you wish, subtract some from the above list, add more from the following list, or change the list around to meet your special needs. Few of us are in a position to keep a large variety of herbs on hand.",

    "contentEn": "1 - Storage: Herbs are best stored in glass jars. Do not expose them to the sunlight for long periods of time. 2 - Weight factor: Larger persons require larger dosages than smaller or underweight individuals. Women generally require smaller doses than men, due to their lower average weight. Children and elderly people need smaller doses. 3 - Climate: The medicinal effect of herbs is intensified in hot climates, therefore give less at such times. 4 - People vary in their reactions: Some people are more intolerant to herbs than are others. It is best to initially give a smaller dose and see what the effect is going to be. It is always safe to start with the smaller child's dose, then build up to a larger dose if that seems best. Increase slowly, remaining on each level for 2-3 days, to observe for unusual reactions. 5 - Dosage for children: Here is the formula: Divide 150 (the assumed average adult weight) by the child's weight. Example: A child weighs 50 pounds. This is 1/3 of the adult (of 150 pounds.). Therefore give him only a third of the regular dose. 6 - During pregnancy: Women respond to herbs differently when they are pregnant. At such times, it is best to give smaller herbal doses and observe response. Sometimes mild and nutritive herbs are best. Some herbs should not be given during pregnancy (including diuretics, purgatives, and emmenagogues; all of which are active in the pelvic area and should be avoided.) 7 - Nervous people: Give them smaller doses than robust individuals. 8 - High blood pressure: These people should avoid herbs that stimulate the heart or constrict the blood capillaries and arteries (licorice root, ephedra, and lily of the valley are examples). But cayenne and garlic can be used in normal amounts. 9 - When herbs are combined: Herbs are frequently combined; but, if not done properly, one herb may overpower or neutralize the effects of others. 10 - Laxative herbs: Give slow-acting laxatives in the morning, so not to disturb sleep. They may take 1- 3 days to work; whereas fast-acting ones usually take 4-8 hours. Do not increase the dosage until a 3-day period is over, using the same dosage every day. Then, if the desired result is not obtained, you may increase the dosage. The desired objective is generally 2 bowel movements a day. 11 - Sedatives and antispasmodic herbs: Give them on an empty stomach or just before bedtime. 12 - Astringents and minerals: Astringent herbs should not be taken at the same time as nutritional supplements containing iron. The tannins in astringent herbs will leach calcium, iron, and other important minerals out of the intestines. Therefore, only give astringent herbs for a short period of time. 13 - Blood-purifying herbs: Take these herbs on an empty stomach. 14 - Strong, bitter herbs: To avoid nausea, be sure and give enough water with them. 15 - Powerful herbs: Be careful in giving herbs which have powerful effects. These include lobelia, juniper berries, black cohosh, poke root, aconite, and horsetail (shave grass). 16 - Bitter pills: They have a tonic effect on the stomach, digestion, and related organs. 17 - Herbal temperatures: A hot infusion or decoction is used to help induce sweating. Cool teas are used for tonic effect, and warm teas produce a feeling of relaxation. (Vervain is the best for inducing sweating.) 18 - Tablets vs. capsules: Tablets are easier to work with than capsules in hot climates; the latter tend to stick together. Vegetarians either open and empty capsules or use tablets, since capsules are made from slaughterhouse products. 19 - Herbs at mealtime: To avoid taking too much liquid, capsules or tablets are preferable to teas at mealtime. 20 - Varying the intensity of the dosage: Here are several principles to keep in mind:\n• For a slow, gradual, general effect, give the herbs in small quantities of syrup or milk\nbetween meals. This will retard absorption.\n• To aid the appetite, increase digestive secretions or, for a local effect on stomach or\nintestines, give herbs before meals. Give the herbs in acacia gum or olive oil for a localized effect on stomach or intestines.\n• To reduce the irritation of certain herbs, give them in syrup or soy milk.\n• To increase absorption of the herbs and produce a more rapid effect, give them 1-2 hours\nafter the meal.\n• To reduce the bitter taste of herbs, without reducing the bitterness, take it in a large\nquantity of fluid, syrup, or honey. The bitter taste is often necessary for the proper effect to take place, but the bitterness can be disguised to the taste buds.\n• Fluids which do not taste good can be taken more easily by drinking them cold, followed\nby a drink of plain water. 21 - Weekly rest day: In order for herbs to work best, they should not be taken one day each week. Then, after 2-3 weeks of treatment, no herbs should be taken for 3 days in a row. During this rest period, observe the patient. (1) If his energy remains low during that time or if the symptoms worsen, at the end of the rest period put him back on the herb dosage. (2) If he improves during the rest period, then extend the rest period a day or so and then continue the treatment with smaller doses than were used before. (3) If he seems to completely recover during the rest period, then the treatment can be changed to a more tonic, nutritive, approach. (4) New symptoms or problems may reveal themselves at this time. If so, an herb formula or new therapy should be instituted to meet it. (5) If he seems to get stronger during each rest period, begin reducing therapy and extending the rest periods.",
    "contentSw": "1 - Hifadhi: Mimea imehifadhiwa vyema kwenye mitungi ya glasi. Usiwaangalie kwa jua kwa muda mrefu. 2 - Sababu ya uzani: Watu wakubwa wanahitaji kipimo kikubwa kuliko watu wadogo au wasio na uzito. Wanawake kwa ujumla wanahitaji dozi ndogo kuliko wanaume, kwa sababu ya uzito wao wa chini. Watoto na wazee wanahitaji dozi ndogo. 3 - Hali ya hewa: Athari ya dawa ya mimea imeongezeka katika hali ya hewa ya moto, kwa hivyo toa kidogo kwa nyakati kama hizo. 4 - Watu hutofautiana katika athari zao: Watu wengine wanavumilia zaidi mimea kuliko wengine. Ni bora hapo awali kutoa kipimo kidogo na uone athari itakuwa nini. Daima ni salama kuanza na kipimo cha mtoto mdogo, kisha ujenge hadi kipimo kikubwa ikiwa hiyo inaonekana bora. Kuongeza polepole, kubaki kwa kila ngazi kwa siku 2-3, kuzingatia athari zisizo za kawaida. 5 - kipimo kwa watoto: Hapa kuna formula: Gawanya 150 (uzani wa wastani wa watu wazima) na uzito wa mtoto. Mfano: Mtoto ana uzito wa pauni 50. Hii ni 1/3 ya watu wazima (wa pauni 150.). Kwa hivyo mpe theluthi ya kipimo cha kawaida. 6 - Wakati wa ujauzito: Wanawake hujibu kwa mimea tofauti wanapokuwa na mjamzito. Kwa nyakati kama hizi, ni bora kutoa dozi ndogo za mitishamba na kuangalia majibu. Wakati mwingine mimea kali na yenye lishe ni bora. Mimea mingine haipaswi kutolewa wakati wa ujauzito (pamoja na diuretics, purgatives, na emmenagogues; yote ambayo ni kazi katika eneo la pelvic na inapaswa kuepukwa.) 7 - watu wa neva: wape kipimo kidogo kuliko watu wenye nguvu. 8 - Shinikizo la damu: Watu hawa wanapaswa kuzuia mimea ambayo huchochea moyo au inasababisha capillaries ya damu na mishipa (mizizi ya licorice, ephedra, na lily ya bonde ni mifano). Lakini cayenne na vitunguu vinaweza kutumika kwa kiwango cha kawaida. 9 - Wakati mimea imejumuishwa: mimea hujumuishwa mara kwa mara; Lakini, ikiwa haijafanywa vizuri, mimea moja inaweza kuzidi au kupunguza athari za wengine. 10 - Mimea ya Laxative: Toa laxatives ya polepole asubuhi, ili usisumbue kulala. Wanaweza kuchukua siku 1- 3 kufanya kazi; wakati wale wanaofanya haraka kawaida huchukua masaa 4-8. Usiongeze kipimo hadi kipindi cha siku 3 kimekwisha, kwa kutumia kipimo sawa kila siku. Halafu, ikiwa matokeo unayotaka hayapatikani, unaweza kuongeza kipimo. Kusudi linalohitajika kwa ujumla ni harakati 2 za matumbo kwa siku. 11 - Sedatives na mimea ya antispasmodic: Wape kwenye tumbo tupu au kabla ya kulala. 12 - Astringents na madini: mimea ya kutu haipaswi kuchukuliwa wakati huo huo kama virutubisho vya lishe vyenye chuma. Tannins katika mimea ya kutuliza itavuja kalsiamu, chuma, na madini mengine muhimu nje ya matumbo. Kwa hivyo, toa mimea ya kutuliza kwa muda mfupi tu. 13 - Mimea ya kusafisha damu: Chukua mimea hii kwenye tumbo tupu. 14 - Mimea yenye nguvu, yenye uchungu: Ili kuepusha kichefuchefu, hakikisha na upe maji ya kutosha nao. 15 - Mimea yenye nguvu: Kuwa mwangalifu katika kutoa mimea ambayo ina athari kubwa. Hii ni pamoja na lobelia, matunda ya juniper, cohosh nyeusi, mzizi wa poke, aconite, na farasi (kunyoa nyasi). 16 - Vidonge vyenye uchungu: Zina athari ya tonic kwenye tumbo, digestion, na viungo vinavyohusiana. 17 - Joto la mitishamba: infusion moto au decoction hutumiwa kusaidia kushawishi jasho. Chai baridi hutumiwa kwa athari ya tonic, na chai ya joto hutoa hisia ya kupumzika. . Mwisho huwa hushikamana pamoja. Wataalam wa mboga ama wazi na vidonge tupu au kutumia vidonge, kwani vidonge hufanywa kutoka kwa bidhaa za kuchinjia. 19 - Mimea wakati wa kula: Ili kuzuia kuchukua kioevu sana, vidonge au vidonge ni vyema kwa chai wakati wa kula. 20 - Kutofautisha kiwango cha kipimo: Hapa kuna kanuni kadhaa za kuzingatia:\n• Kwa athari ya polepole, polepole, ya jumla, toa mimea kwa idadi ndogo ya syrup au maziwa\nkati ya milo. Hii itarudisha kunyonya.\n• Kusaidia hamu, kuongeza secretions ya utumbo au, kwa athari ya ndani juu ya tumbo au\nmatumbo, toa mimea kabla ya milo. Toa mimea katika ufizi wa Acacia au mafuta ya mizeituni kwa athari ya ndani ya tumbo au matumbo.\n• Ili kupunguza kuwasha kwa mimea fulani, wape katika syrup au maziwa ya soya.\n• Kuongeza kunyonya kwa mimea na kutoa athari ya haraka zaidi, wape masaa 1-2\nbaada ya chakula.\n• Ili kupunguza ladha kali ya mimea, bila kupunguza uchungu, ichukue kwa kubwa\nwingi wa maji, syrup, au asali. Ladha yenye uchungu mara nyingi ni muhimu kwa athari sahihi ifanyike, lakini uchungu unaweza kujificha na buds za ladha.\n• Maji ambayo haya ladha nzuri yanaweza kuchukuliwa kwa urahisi zaidi kwa kunywa baridi, ikifuatiwa\nna kinywaji cha maji wazi. 21 - Siku ya kupumzika ya kila wiki: Ili mimea ifanye kazi vizuri, haipaswi kuchukuliwa siku moja kila wiki. Halafu, baada ya wiki 2-3 za matibabu, hakuna mimea inayopaswa kuchukuliwa kwa siku 3 mfululizo. Katika kipindi hiki cha kupumzika, angalia mgonjwa. (1) Ikiwa nishati yake inabaki chini wakati huo au ikiwa dalili zinazidi, mwisho wa kipindi cha kupumzika kilimrudisha kwenye kipimo cha mimea. . (3) Ikiwa anaonekana kupona kabisa wakati wa kupumzika, basi matibabu yanaweza kubadilishwa kuwa njia ya tonic zaidi, yenye lishe. (4) Dalili mpya au shida zinaweza kujifunua kwa wakati huu. Ikiwa ni hivyo, formula ya mimea au tiba mpya inapaswa kuanzishwa ili kukutana nayo. (5) Ikiwa anaonekana kuwa na nguvu katika kila kipindi cha kupumzika, anza kupunguza tiba na kupanua vipindi vya kupumzika."

    "title": "The Healing Crisis",
    "contentEn": "Physicians and laymen have known about the healing crisis for thousands of years. During the healing process, the body tries to throw off toxins and poisons. What is known as the \"healing crisis\" frequently occurs in illnesses. The body seems overwhelmed with all the toxins and wastes it is trying to throw off. The organs of elimination (bowels, kidneys, lungs, skin, nasal passages, throat, bronchi, and urinary organs) become congested, crowded, and irritated. During this crisis, that which appears to be disease symptoms appear. These may be open sores, perspiration, diarrhea, boils, colds, kidney and bladder infections, fevers, etc. But this is not a new, or intensified, disease—it is just part of the healing process. The body knows it must eliminate the wastes before it can begin rebuilding, so it works valiantly to do this. Physicians sometimes try to stop the process by introducing poisons (drugs) into the system. Immediately, the body stops throwing off wastes—stops the crisis—and turns its attention to the terrible new invader. The body may appear to be resting quietly now, with the symptoms reduced or gone; but, in actuality, it has been prostrated by the drugging. Let us now return to a healing crisis and its symptoms. They are part of the cure, and should not be feared. Just work with the body, to help eliminate those toxic wastes. Open the channels of elimination by means of drinking water and fruit juices, fasting, enemas, colonics, showers, baths, and water treatments. Sometimes the pain becomes severe during the crisis. Drugs taken in earlier years are being pulled out of the tissues in an effort to discard. The damage of many years is being righted. The body arouses itself in self-defense and brings forth acute elimination of toxins in the form of a fever, cold, inflammations, itching, boils, ulcers, hemorrhages, excessive menstrual discharge, etc. Reactions vary, in accordance with how the person has been living and the condition of the body. But sometimes this sudden turn in an illness is not a healing crisis, but a change for the worse in a disease. It is important to be able to tell the difference. Consider this:\n• Watch the person carefully, as you work earnestly to help him eliminate toxins (water,\njuices, enemas, sweating, baths, etc.) If not watched properly and helped, the crisis can be extended and his energies weakened.\n• If it is a healing crisis, you will generally see a positive change—a change for the\nbetter—after three days. The most severe symptoms begin to decrease. Fevers break. The person becomes more relaxed and begins to feel better.\n• But if, after three days, the symptoms do not change for the better, then a new course of\ntreatment must be started. However, if the person has low energy and vitality, the crisis may take three to seven days.\n• If the individual has a strong constitution and the organs of elimination are working well\nand are being helped, he may recover without having undergone a healing crisis. Are there ways to tell when a healing crisis is about to begin? Certain symptoms will intensify, such as sluggishness, fevers, dark urine, coated tongue, weakness, irritability, headaches, and ringing in the ears. When you see these signs, immediately set to work to help the person's system cleanse more fully. Herbs, massage, water therapy treatments, and enemas can help him through this time. If no poisons were introduced into the system (in an effort to block the healing crisis) the person will generally keep improving. Right living, right eating, and rest can bring healing. Additional healing crises may occur before the patient is fully recovered. Each one will generally be milder, only one to three days in length, and be followed by a new level of feeling better. The intensity of the crisis will depend on how ill the person was. The nature of the crisis will be keyed to where the illness is centered in his body and how easily he can throw off the poisons. If the wastes can be eliminated through normal pathways, a fever will develop to burn it out or store it as boils and acne. If the mucous is thick, there will be nasal drip, colds, flu, etc. Constipation may precede diarrhea; lung congestion may come before a respiratory crisis. Sometimes we feel pain in our kidneys, bladder, or bowels and imagine it is a disease. But, in fact, often the body has selected the strongest organ of elimination to throw off unwanted and excess wastes. When the crisis is over, the body needs help rebuilding itself. But, throughout the sickness and recovery, never go to extremes in diet. Carry on with a gradual transition back to regular living. Trying to make the system too pure too fast can overly weaken the patient. Work carefully, keep praying for guidance; and, if the patient fully cooperates, all will go well.",
    "contentSw": "Waganga na walinzi wamejua juu ya shida ya uponyaji kwa maelfu ya miaka. Wakati wa mchakato wa uponyaji, mwili hujaribu kutupa sumu na sumu. Kinachojulikana kama \"shida ya uponyaji\" mara nyingi hufanyika katika magonjwa. Mwili unaonekana kuzidiwa na sumu na taka zote zinajaribu kutupa. Viungo vya kuondoa (matumbo, figo, mapafu, ngozi, vifungu vya pua, koo, bronchi, na viungo vya mkojo) hujaa, kujaa, na kukasirika. Wakati wa shida hii, ambayo inaonekana kuwa dalili za ugonjwa huonekana. Hizi zinaweza kuwa vidonda wazi, jasho, kuhara, majipu, homa, maambukizo ya figo na kibofu cha mkojo, fevers, nk. Lakini hii sio mpya, au iliyoimarishwa, ni sehemu tu ya mchakato wa uponyaji. Mwili unajua lazima uondoe taka kabla ya kuanza kujenga tena, kwa hivyo inafanya kazi kwa nguvu kufanya hivyo. Waganga wakati mwingine hujaribu kuzuia mchakato kwa kuanzisha sumu (dawa) kwenye mfumo. Mara moja, mwili huacha kutupa taka - husababisha shida -na huelekeza umakini wake kwa mvamizi mpya mbaya. Mwili unaweza kuonekana kuwa unapumzika kimya sasa, na dalili zimepunguzwa au zimepita; Lakini, kwa ukweli, imekuwa ikisumbuliwa na dawa ya kulevya. Wacha sasa turudi kwenye shida ya uponyaji na dalili zake. Ni sehemu ya tiba, na haipaswi kuogopwa. Fanya tu kazi na mwili, kusaidia kuondoa taka hizo zenye sumu. Fungua vituo vya kuondoa kwa njia ya kunywa maji na juisi za matunda, kufunga, enemas, koloni, maonyesho, bafu, na matibabu ya maji. Wakati mwingine maumivu huwa kali wakati wa shida. Dawa za kulevya zilizochukuliwa katika miaka ya mapema hutolewa nje ya tishu kwa kujaribu kutupa. Uharibifu wa miaka mingi ni sawa. Mwili huamsha yenyewe katika kujilinda na huleta kuondoa kwa papo hapo kwa sumu kwa njia ya homa, baridi, uchochezi, kuwasha, majipu, vidonda, hemorrhages, kutokwa kwa hedhi, nk. Athari hutofautiana, kulingana na jinsi mtu huyo amekuwa akiishi na hali ya mwili. Lakini wakati mwingine zamu hii ya ghafla katika ugonjwa sio shida ya uponyaji, lakini mabadiliko ya mbaya zaidi katika ugonjwa. Ni muhimu kuweza kusema tofauti. Fikiria hii:\n• Tazama mtu huyo kwa uangalifu, unapofanya kazi kwa bidii kumsaidia kuondoa sumu (maji,\nJuisi, enemas, jasho, bafu, nk) Ikiwa haikuangaliwa vizuri na kusaidiwa, shida inaweza kupanuliwa na nguvu zake zimedhoofika.\n• Ikiwa ni shida ya uponyaji, kwa ujumla utaona mabadiliko mazuri - mabadiliko ya\nBora -baada ya siku tatu. Dalili kali zaidi huanza kupungua. Fevers huvunja. Mtu huyo anarudishwa zaidi na huanza kujisikia vizuri.\n• Lakini ikiwa, baada ya siku tatu, dalili hazibadilika kuwa bora, basi kozi mpya ya\nMatibabu lazima ianzishwe. Walakini, ikiwa mtu huyo ana nguvu ndogo na nguvu, shida inaweza kuchukua siku tatu hadi saba.\n• Ikiwa mtu ana katiba kali na viungo vya kuondoa vinafanya kazi vizuri\nna anasaidiwa, anaweza kupona bila kufanyiwa shida ya uponyaji. Je! Kuna njia za kusema wakati shida ya uponyaji inakaribia kuanza? Dalili fulani zitaongezeka, kama vile uvivu, fevers, mkojo wa giza, ulimi uliofunikwa, udhaifu, kuwashwa, maumivu ya kichwa, na kulia masikioni. Unapoona ishara hizi, mara moja weka kufanya kazi kusaidia mfumo wa mtu kusafisha kikamilifu. Mimea, massage, matibabu ya matibabu ya maji, na enemas zinaweza kumsaidia kupitia wakati huu. Ikiwa hakuna sumu zilizoletwa kwenye mfumo (katika juhudi za kuzuia shida ya uponyaji) mtu huyo kwa ujumla ataendelea kuboreka. Kuishi sawa, kula kulia, na kupumzika kunaweza kuleta uponyaji. Mgogoro wa nyongeza wa uponyaji unaweza kutokea kabla ya mgonjwa kupona kabisa. Kila moja itakuwa laini, siku moja hadi tatu kwa urefu, na kufuatwa na kiwango kipya cha kujisikia bora. Nguvu ya shida hiyo itategemea jinsi mtu huyo alikuwa mgonjwa. Asili ya shida hiyo itabadilishwa ambapo ugonjwa huo umewekwa ndani ya mwili wake na jinsi anavyoweza kutupa sumu kwa urahisi. Ikiwa taka zinaweza kuondolewa kupitia njia za kawaida, homa itakua ili kuichoma au kuihifadhi kama majipu na chunusi. Ikiwa mucous ni nene, kutakuwa na matone ya pua, homa, homa, nk. Kuvimbiwa kunaweza kutangulia kuhara; Msongamano wa mapafu unaweza kuja kabla ya shida ya kupumua. Wakati mwingine tunahisi maumivu katika figo zetu, kibofu cha mkojo, au matumbo na fikiria ni ugonjwa. Lakini, kwa kweli, mara nyingi mwili umechagua chombo kikali cha kuondoa ili kutupa taka zisizohitajika na kupita kiasi. Wakati shida imekwisha, mwili unahitaji kusaidia kujijengea yenyewe. Lakini, wakati wote wa ugonjwa na kupona, kamwe usiende kwenye lishe. Endelea na mabadiliko ya taratibu kurudi kwa maisha ya kawaida. Kujaribu kufanya mfumo safi sana haraka sana kunaweza kumdhoofisha mgonjwa. Fanya kazi kwa uangalifu, endelea kuomba mwongozo; Na, ikiwa mgonjwa atashirikiana kikamilifu, yote yataenda vizuri.",

Neutral temperatures are\ngood for relaxing the person, but they do not produce the powerful effects that hot and cold can give.\n• Water is capable of absorbing and storing a larger amount of heat than nearly any other\nsubstance on earth; that is, it has a high specific heat. This means that, when water is applied to the body (in a cloth, bath, shower, etc.), it will impart more heat (or cold) than any other substance at the same temperature.\n• In its effects, ice is far colder than its temperature of 32o F., and steam is far hotter than\n212o F. (Keep in mind that steam can burn.)\n• Water must be in contact with the body for awhile in order to impart heat or cold. But it\nonly need contact it for a moment to give a thermic impression that can be quite strong. For example, plunge your arm for only a moment into a pail of very cold water. It was only there for a moment, but the effect on the circulating blood in the arm will be powerful. This is thermic impression, and it is very important. You do not have to cool the body with lengthy cold in order to have it react strongly to that cold.\n• Water is the world's greatest solvent. It can cleanse better than anything else. It can\nremove wastes. But it can also hold nutrients placed within it for the body to absorb.\n• Neither infants nor aged persons bear cold treatment well. Some chill after almost any\nkind of cold application. Remember that they are only being helped if they react well to the cold application. If they do not, then they are not being helped. Conditions which do not react well to cold would include anemia, emaciation, asthenia, extreme thinness, etc. If a person cannot be benefited by cold, then apply mild heat instead. Always keep the feet warm.\n• The body should be warm before the cold is applied. He should become warm afterward.\nExercise, friction, percussion—all help bring a good reaction. Hot given beforehand to warm the body also aids it. You may need to apply hot to the feet before the cold is given, and, if need be, afterward also.\n• The cold treatment should be given quickly. As soon as it is completed, quickly dry him.\nFriction as he is rubbed with the towel, or afterward, will also help warm him. He must be dried very quickly and well. Dry him in a warm room, near where the last cold application was given. Have his clothes all ready for him to put on. This requires advance planning. Carelessness after the cold can undo all the value that could have been gained from it.\n• By alternating the hot and cold applications, the beneficial properties of both may be\nobtained without many of the disadvantages of either. As you become acquainted with the many water therapies given in the author's book, The Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet), you will notice that they tend to do one or more of six things:\n• Bring blood to an afflicted part. This will frequently be an area closer to the surface and\noutside of the trunk.\n• Pull blood from a deeper internal organ to the skin just above it. This deeper, congested,\narea is often in the trunk, and the hot application (or a cold-to-heating application) was placed on the skin just above that organ.\n• Draw blood away from a deeper, congested, organ by placing the application, not on the\nskin just above the internal organ,—but on a reflex area somewhere else on the body.\n• Pull blood from the internal organ to a distant body part (usually the legs and/or\nfeet—best both). This is called derivation, and is frequently done at the same time that an application is made just above the internal organ (or to a reflex area connected to it by nerves), to also pull blood away from that congested organ.\n• A proximal compress, consisting of a cold application, may be placed on an extremity.\nAn example would be an ice compress around the neck. This will greatly reduce the amount of blood flowing into the head.\n• A full application to most of the body to relieve congestion, equalize the circulation, and\nbring warmth from that application (a hot pack, apply heat) or by reaction to it (a heating compress, applying cold for the body to heat). There are many additional guiding principles involved in the use of water therapy. Water is a most precious gift from God. Make good use of it, in both sickness and in health. HYDRO—When HYDRO is shown at the beginning of a paragraph, it refers to water treatments in the author's hydrotherapy book, Water Therapy Manual (see order sheet). In case you do not have that book, the name of the water treatments are given. But page numbers are also cited, so you can learn more about how to give these applications if you have that book. Only a very small sampling of the water treatments described in that book are mentioned in this one. Many more could have been included, but this present book would have become too large.",
    "contentSw": "Itakuwa vizuri kujumuisha maagizo hapa juu ya jinsi ya kutoa matibabu rahisi ya maji; Lakini, kama mimea ya mitishamba, haiwezi kufunikwa vizuri katika kurasa chache. Mwandishi wa sasa aliandika kitabu cha kurasa 290, kilichoitwa Mwongozo wa Tiba ya Maji (tazama Karatasi ya Agizo), ambayo inashughulikia mada hiyo vizuri. Unaweza kupata nakala, mradi tu zinapatikana. Hapa kuna kanuni chache tu za tiba ya maji:\n• Ni joto na baridi ya maji ambayo hutoa matokeo. Joto la upande wowote ni\nNzuri kwa kupumzika mtu, lakini haitoi athari zenye nguvu ambazo moto na baridi zinaweza kutoa.\n• Maji yana uwezo wa kunyonya na kuhifadhi joto kubwa kuliko karibu nyingine yoyote\ndutu duniani; Hiyo ni, ina joto maalum. Hii inamaanisha kuwa, wakati maji yanatumika kwa mwili (kwa kitambaa, bafu, bafu, nk), itatoa joto zaidi (au baridi) kuliko dutu nyingine yoyote kwa joto moja.\n• Katika athari zake, barafu ni baridi sana kuliko joto lake la 32O F., na mvuke ni moto sana kuliko\n212O F. (kumbuka kuwa mvuke inaweza kuwaka.)\n• Maji lazima yawasiliane na mwili kwa muda ili kutoa joto au baridi. Lakini\nUnahitaji tu kuwasiliana nayo kwa muda mfupi ili kutoa maoni ya joto ambayo inaweza kuwa na nguvu kabisa. Kwa mfano, piga mkono wako kwa muda mfupi tu kwenye pail ya maji baridi sana. Ilikuwa tu kwa muda, lakini athari kwenye damu inayozunguka kwenye mkono itakuwa na nguvu. Hii ni maoni ya joto, na ni muhimu sana. Sio lazima baridi mwili na baridi kali ili iweze kuguswa sana na baridi hiyo.\n• Maji ndio kutengenezea kubwa zaidi ulimwenguni. Inaweza kusafisha bora kuliko kitu kingine chochote. Inaweza\nOndoa taka. Lakini pia inaweza kushikilia virutubishi vilivyowekwa ndani yake kwa mwili kunyonya.\n• Wala watoto wachanga wala wazee hubeba matibabu baridi vizuri. Baadhi ya baridi baada ya karibu yoyote\naina ya matumizi ya baridi. Kumbuka kwamba wanasaidiwa tu ikiwa wataitikia vizuri matumizi ya baridi. Ikiwa hawafanyi, basi hawasaidiwi. Masharti ambayo hayafanyi vizuri kwa baridi ni pamoja na upungufu wa damu, emaciation, asthenia, nyembamba sana, nk Ikiwa mtu hawezi kufaidika na baridi, kisha utumie joto kali badala yake. Daima kuweka miguu joto.\n• Mwili unapaswa kuwa joto kabla ya baridi kutumika. Anapaswa kuwa joto baadaye.\nZoezi, msuguano, mtazamo -wote husaidia kuleta majibu mazuri. Moto uliopewa mapema ili joto mwili pia husaidia. Unaweza kuhitaji kuomba moto kwa miguu kabla ya baridi kutolewa, na, ikiwa inahitajika, baadaye pia.\n• Matibabu ya baridi inapaswa kutolewa haraka. Mara tu itakapokamilika, kavu haraka.\nFriction kama yeye kusugua na kitambaa, au baadaye, pia itasaidia joto yake. Lazima kavu haraka sana na vizuri. Kausha katika chumba cha joto, karibu na mahali pa matumizi ya baridi ya mwisho. Acha nguo zake ziwe tayari kwa yeye kuvaa. Hii inahitaji upangaji mapema. Kutojali baada ya baridi inaweza kuondoa thamani yote ambayo ingeweza kupatikana kutoka kwake.\n• Kwa kubadilisha matumizi ya moto na baridi, mali ya faida ya wote inaweza kuwa\nkupatikana bila shida nyingi za ama. Unapofahamiana na matibabu mengi ya maji yaliyopewa katika kitabu cha mwandishi, Mwongozo wa Tiba ya Maji (tazama karatasi ya kuagiza), utagundua kuwa huwa wanafanya moja au zaidi ya mambo sita:\n• Kuleta damu kwa sehemu inayoteseka. Hii itakuwa mara kwa mara eneo karibu na uso na\nnje ya shina.\n• Bonyeza damu kutoka kwa chombo cha ndani zaidi hadi ngozi juu yake. Hii zaidi, imejaa,\nEneo mara nyingi huwa kwenye shina, na matumizi ya moto (au programu ya baridi-kwa-joto) iliwekwa kwenye ngozi hapo juu tu chombo hicho.\n• Chora damu mbali na chombo kirefu, kilichokusanywa, kwa kuweka programu, sio kwenye\nNgozi juu ya chombo cha ndani, - lakini kwenye eneo la Reflex mahali pengine kwenye mwili.\n• Vuta damu kutoka kwa chombo cha ndani hadi sehemu ya mbali ya mwili (kawaida miguu na/au\nMiguu -Best zote mbili). Hii inaitwa derivation, na mara nyingi hufanywa wakati huo huo maombi hufanywa juu ya chombo cha ndani (au eneo la Reflex lililounganishwa nayo na mishipa), pia kuvuta damu mbali na chombo hicho kilichojaa.\n• Compress ya proximal, inayojumuisha programu ya baridi, inaweza kuwekwa kwenye ukingo.\nMfano itakuwa compress ya barafu karibu na shingo. Hii itapunguza sana kiwango cha damu inapita ndani ya kichwa.\n• Maombi kamili kwa mwili mwingi ili kupunguza msongamano, kusawazisha mzunguko, na\nKuleta joto kutoka kwa programu hiyo (pakiti ya moto, tumia joto) au kwa athari yake (compress ya joto, kutumia baridi kwa mwili kwa joto). Kuna kanuni nyingi za ziada zinazoongoza zinazohusika katika utumiaji wa tiba ya maji. Maji ni zawadi ya thamani zaidi kutoka kwa Mungu. Tumia vizuri, katika ugonjwa wote na katika afya. Hydro -Wakati hydro inaonyeshwa mwanzoni mwa aya, inahusu matibabu ya maji katika kitabu cha hydrotherapy cha mwandishi, Mwongozo wa Tiba ya Maji (tazama Karatasi ya Agizo). Ikiwa hauna kitabu hicho, jina la matibabu ya maji hupewa. Lakini nambari za ukurasa pia zimetajwa, kwa hivyo unaweza kujifunza zaidi juu ya jinsi ya kutoa programu hizi ikiwa unayo kitabu hicho. Sampuli ndogo tu ya matibabu ya maji yaliyoelezewa katika kitabu hicho yametajwa katika hii. Wengi zaidi wangeweza kujumuishwa, lakini kitabu hiki cha sasa kingekuwa kubwa sana.",

    "contentEn": "The following analysis of the nature and effects of medicinal drug medication is taken from the writings of Ellen G. White, an influential author and worker in the field of health and natural healing. She was also the founder of a major medical college. \"Drugs never cure disease; they only change its form and location . . When drugs are introduced into the system, for a time they seem to have a beneficial effect. A change may take place, but the disease is not cured. It will manifest itself in some other form . . The disease which the drug was given to cure may disappear, but only to reappear in a new form, such as skin diseases, ulcers, painful diseased joints, and sometimes in a more dangerous and deadly form . . Nature keeps struggling, and the patient suffers with different ailments, until there is a sudden breaking down in her efforts, and death follows.\"—How to Live, 60. \"Although the patient may recover, yet the powerful effort nature was required to make to overcome the poison, injured the constitution and shortened the life of the patient. There are many who do not die under the influence of drugs, but there are very many who are left useless wrecks, hopeless, gloomy, and miserable sufferers, a burden to themselves and to society.\"—How to Live, 50. \"Every additional drug given to the patient . . will complicate the case, and make the patient's recovery more hopeless . . An evil, simple in the beginning, which nature aroused herself to overcome, and which she would have done if left to herself, aided by the common blessings of Heaven, has been made tenfold worse by introducing drug poisons into the system, which cause of themselves a destructive disease, forcing into extraordinary action the remaining life forces to war against and overcome the drug intruder.\"—How to Live, 57. \"There are more who die from the use of drugs than all who would have died of disease had nature been left to do her own work.\"—How to Live, 61. \"The endless variety of medicines in the market, the numerous advertisements of new drugs and mixtures, all of which claim to do wonderful cures, kill hundreds where they benefit one . . Yet people keep dosing, and continue to grow weaker until they die . . God's servants should not administer medicines which they know will leave behind injurious effects upon the system, even if they do relieve present suffering. Every poisonous preparation in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, taken into the system, will leave its wretched influence, affecting the liver and lungs, and deranging the system generally.\"—Facts of Faith, 140. \"Educate away from drugs, use them less and less, and spend more and more upon hygienic agencies. Nature will respond to God's remedies,—pure air, pure water, proper exercise, and a clear conscience.\"—Letter, 1888. \"A great amount of good can be done by enlightening all to whom we have access, as to the best means, not only of curing the sick, but of preventing disease and suffering. The physician who endeavors to enlighten his patients as to the nature and causes of their maladies, and to teach them how to avoid disease, may have up-hill work; but if he is a conscientious reformer, he will talk plainly of the ruinous effects of self-indulgence in eating, drinking, and dressing, of the overtaxation of the vital forces that has brought his patients where they are. He will not increase the evil by administering drugs till exhausted nature gives up the struggle, but will teach the patients how to form correct habits and to aid nature in her work of restoration by a wise use of her own remedies.\"—Christian Temperance, 121. \"In treating the sick, the physician will seek God for wisdom; then, instead of placing his dependence upon drugs and expecting that medicine will bring health to his patients, he will use nature's restoratives, and employ natural means whereby the sick may be aided to recover.\"—Healthful Living, 247-248. \"Let the instruction be given in simple words [such as hot water, charcoal, or catnip tea]. We have no need to use the many expressions used by worldly physicians which are so difficult to understand that they must be interpreted by physicians . . Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs.\"—Letter 82, 1908. \"Were I sick, I would just as soon call in a lawyer as a physician from among general practitioners. I would not touch their nostrums, to which they give Latin names. I am determined to know, in straight English, the name of everything that I introduce into my system.\"—Manuscript 86, 1897. \"Indulging in eating too frequently, and in too large quantities, overtaxes the digestive organs and produces a feverish state of the system. The blood becomes impure, and then diseases of various kinds occur. A physician is sent for, who prescribes some drug which gives present relief, but which does not cure the disease. It may change the form of the disease, but the real evil is increased ten-fold. Nature was doing her best to rid the system of an accumulation of impurities, and should she have been left to herself, aided by the common blessings of heaven, such as pure air and pure water, a speedy and safe cure could have been affected.\"—4 Spiritual Gifts, 133. \"Use nature's remedies,—water, sunshine, and fresh air. Do not use drugs. Drugs never heal; they only change the features of the disease.\"—Letter 116, 1903. \"Experimenting in drugs is a very expensive business . . Nothing should be put into the human system that will leave a baleful influence behind.\"—Medical Ministry, 228. \"Nature's simple remedies will aid in recovery without leaving the deadly aftereffects so often felt by those who use poisonous drugs. They destroy the power of the patient to help himself. This power the patients are to be taught to exercise by learning to eat simple, healthful foods, by refusing to overload the stomach with a variety of foods at one meal. All these things should come into the education of the sick. Talks should be given showing how to preserve health, how to shun sickness, how to rest when rest is needed.\"—Letter 82, 1908. \"Christ's remedies cleanse the system. But Satan has tempted man to introduce into the system that which weakens the human machinery, clogging and destroying the fine, beautiful arrangements of God. The drugs administered to the sick do not restore, but destroy. Drugs never cure. Instead, they place in the system seeds which bear a very bitter harvest.\"—2 Selected Messages, 289. \"Thousands need to be educated patiently, kindly, tenderly, but decidedly, that nine-tenths of their complaints are created by their own course of action. The more they introduce drugs into the system, the more certainly do they interfere with the laws of nature and bring about the very difficulties they drug themselves to avoid.\"—Letter 22, 1889. \"Instead of taking a course to baffle disease, you are petting it and yielding to its power. You should avoid the use of drugs and carefully observe the laws of health. If you regard your life, you should eat plain food, prepared in the simplest manner, and take more physical exercise. Each member of the family needs the benefit of health reform. But drugging should be forever abandoned. For while it does not cure any malady, it enfeebles the system, making it more susceptible to disease.\"—5 Testimonies, 311. \"If those who take these drugs were alone the sufferers, the evil would not be as great. But parents not only sin against themselves in swallowing drug-poisons, but they sin against their children. The vitiated state of their blood, the poison distributed throughout the system, the broken constitutions and various drug diseases, as the result of drug poisons, are transmitted to their offspring, and left them as a wretched inheritance, which is another great cause of the degeneracy of the race.\"—How to Live, 53.

    "contentEn": "The year was 1875; the place, Paris, France. For more than two years, three scientists had worked toward this day, and now they were ready. Carefully, they climbed into the gondola of the balloon, \"Zenith,\" while thousands around them watched. Determined to set a new altitude record, they wanted to go higher than man had ever risen above the earth. And they did just that,—but at what a cost. Slowly the large balloon rose into the air, with its human cargo of three men in a basket-shaped gondola swinging just beneath it. All seemed well; they were well on their way toward the goal: to climb higher than any man had ever gone. Then at 24,430 feet it happened. Tissandier, one of the three, later described it: \"Croce is gasping for breath, Sivel is dazed, but can still cut three sandbags loose in order to reach 26,240 feet.\" At that point, Tissandier himself was overcome and slumped to the floor, losing consciousness. Some time afterward, as the balloon—freed from the sandbags continued its ascent—he awoke. They had attained a height of 8,600 meters (approximately 28,000 feet)—but two of the scientists lay dead in the gondola of the balloon. Yes, they had conquered the heights, but before it was done the heights had conquered them. There was not enough air, with its precious life-giving oxygen, to sustain life at that great altitude. Without air, man dies. Air is the most vital element for man and animals. One may live for weeks without food, or for days without water, but deprived of air he will perish within minutes. Millions of people suffer from a wide variety of ailments that are partly caused by an insufficient supply of oxygen. The problem is that most people do not breathe correctly, and this continually weakens their",
    "contentSw": "Mwaka ulikuwa 1875; Mahali, Paris, Ufaransa. Kwa zaidi ya miaka miwili, wanasayansi watatu walikuwa wamefanya kazi hadi leo, na sasa walikuwa tayari. Kwa uangalifu, walipanda ndani ya gondola ya puto, \"Zenith,\" wakati maelfu karibu nao waliangalia. Waliamua kuweka rekodi mpya ya urefu, walitaka kwenda juu zaidi kuliko mwanadamu aliyewahi kuongezeka juu ya dunia. Na walifanya hivyo tu, - lakini kwa gharama gani. Polepole puto kubwa iliongezeka hewani, na mizigo yake ya kibinadamu ya wanaume watatu kwenye gondola iliyokuwa na umbo la kikapu chini yake. Yote yalionekana vizuri; Walikuwa njiani kuelekea lengo: kupanda juu kuliko mtu yeyote aliyewahi kwenda. Halafu kwa miguu 24,430 ilitokea. Tissandier, mmoja wa hao watatu, baadaye alielezea: \"Croce anapumua kwa pumzi, Sivel ameshangaa, lakini bado anaweza kukata mikoba mitatu ili kufikia futi 26,240.\" Katika hatua hiyo, Tissandier mwenyewe alishindwa na kupungua kwa sakafu, akipoteza fahamu. Wakati fulani baadaye, kama puto - iliyoandaliwa kutoka kwa mikoba ya mchanga iliendelea kupaa - akaamka. Walikuwa wamepata urefu wa mita 8,600 (takriban futi 28,000) - lakini wanasayansi wawili walilala kwenye gondola ya puto. Ndio, walikuwa wameshinda urefu, lakini kabla ya kufanywa urefu ulikuwa umewashinda. Hakukuwa na hewa ya kutosha, na oksijeni yake yenye thamani ya kutoa maisha, kudumisha maisha katika urefu huo mkubwa. Bila hewa, mwanadamu hufa. Hewa ndio kitu muhimu zaidi kwa mwanadamu na wanyama. Mtu anaweza kuishi kwa wiki bila chakula, au kwa siku bila maji, lakini kunyimwa hewa atapotea ndani ya dakika. Mamilioni ya watu wanakabiliwa na magonjwa anuwai ambayo kwa sehemu husababishwa na usambazaji wa kutosha wa oksijeni. Shida ni kwamba watu wengi hawapumua kwa usahihi, na hii inadhoofisha yao kila wakati",
