    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Obtain a nourishing diet. (See \"Bones, Strengthening,\" just below.)\n• Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme which acts to reduce swelling and\ninflammation. Eat half a fresh (not canned or processed) pineapple daily, until the fracture\nheals. Canned pineapple or pineapple juice may contain aluminum salts, pulled by the acid\nfrom the can by the very acid liquid.\n• During healing, the diet should include enough calories in order to provide the energy\nnecessary for new bone-cell formation.\n• You may use clay poultices to alleviate bruising and swelling.\n• Helpful herbs include comfrey and alfalfa. Also helpful are plantain and mistletoe.\n• Also place comfrey over the site of the fracture, to speed healing and reduce pain and\nswelling.\n• Too much calcium supplementation, during bone healing, can induce kidney stone\nformation during the immobile period while the cast is on. The problem is that the person\nis not active enough at that time.\n—For detailed information on rebuilding the bones, see \"Bones, Strengthening.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—The grace of Christ and the law of God are inseparable. In Jesus, mercy and\ntruth are met together. By His death and mediation, Jesus can forgive our sins and enable us to resist\ntemptation and live clean, godly lives.\n# BONES, STRENGTHENING\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES—You cannot succeed in life without good bones. The bones most likely\nto be damaged by lack of care includes the jawbone, teeth, spine, hip, legs, and joints—all very\nimportant.\nThe objective is to achieve the highest possible bone mass before old age, and then to maintain it as long\nas possible. The following recommendations will help you fulfill these objectives:\nThe body requires calcium for many things, although bones are the most obvious need. For example,\nthere has to be a certain amount of calcium in the blood all the time. But when, for one reason or\nanother, the intake of certain minerals is not adequate, calcium is reabsorbed out of the bones in order to\nsupply other needs elsewhere. (One of these needs is providing calcium to a growing fetus during\npregnancy.) The bones become porous and \"honeycombed,\" and so fragile that breaks can more easily\noccur.\nA major cause is a lack of calcium intake over a period of years. Other causes include inability to absorb\ncalcium as well, a calcium-phosphorous imbalance (too much phosphorous), lack of exercise, or lack of\ncertain hormones.\nObtaining enough nutrients, through diet and supplements, is important to maintaining strong bones.\nCalcium at 2,000 mg a day, magnesium at 1,000 mg per day, along with plant-derived colloidal minerals\nis needed.\nDigestive aids may be needed to help absorb this and other minerals. Especially important is sufficient\nacid in the stomach. Either betaine HCl (hydrochloric acid supplement) or lemon juice can be taken.\nCalcium and minerals are found abundantly in natural foods such as green leafy vegetables, carrot juice,\nand broccoli. The green leafy vegetables are generally the best sources. Along with them ranks sesame\nseeds. They are the best ratio of high calcium and low phosphorous of any food.\nA dietary calcium/phosphorous ratio of 2:1 is ideal, yet can only be attained by taking calcium\nsupplements. Here are some samples of this ratio of calcium to phosphorous in several foods: grain -\n1:8; red meat - 1:12; organ meat (liver, kidney) - 1:44; fish - 1:12; carbonated drinks - 1:8.\nPeople who eat meat and/or drink various colas and sodas obtain an immense amount of phosphorous.\nMillet is rich in calcium and magnesium. Almonds are high in calcium. The grains, amaranth and\nquinoa, are rich in minerals.\nFruitarians (people who only eat fruit) do not get enough calcium or the magnesium needed to help the\ncalcium be utilized.\nEat plenty of vegetables, raw and steamed.\nOther foods high in calcium include brown rice, kale, turnip greens, pinto beans, spirulina, collard\ngreens, and sesame seeds.\nThose with dentures tend to find vegetables difficult to eat. This results in a magnesium and calcium\ndeficiency. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw vegetable juices daily.\nLack of hydrochloric acid can be a cause of poor calcium (and other mineral) absorption.\nVitamin D is necessary (400-1,000 IU daily) for calcium absorption and repair. You need a basic 400 IU\ndaily. Sunlight will help you get part of what you need. (It is estimated that, on the average, only 10% of\nour daily requirement comes from sunlight; so other sources are also needed.) People over 65 may need\n800 units daily.\nIn one study, the more sunlight that was obtained by the test group, the less likelihood of osteoporosis\ndeveloping.\nBut excess doses of vitamin D, taken repeatedly, caused bone deterioration.\nPotassium is needed for cell formation, and vitamin C is necessary for the maintenance and development\nof bones. Vitamin C is called \"cell cement\"; it not only fights infection, but also holds your body\ntogether!\nGarlic, onions, and eggs contain sulfur, which is needed for healthy bones.\nManganese helps prevent osteoporosis (loss of bone mass). Rats on a low manganese diet developed\nporous bones.\nVitamin A helps increase the rate of bone growth. It is needed for proper digestion and assimilation of\nnutrients.\nVitamin B complex helps bone mass formation. B increases connective tissue strength in bones.\n6\nVitamin K (found in alfalfa, greens, and other chlorophyll foods) is needed to help the body synthesize\nosteocalcin, a special protein matrix which attracts calcium to the bones.\nFolic acid works to prevent the formation of toxic homocysteine from the essential amino acid,\nmethionine. The presence of homocysteine is involved in producing osteoporosis. (Alcohol, tobacco,\nand oral contraceptives increase folic acid deficiency.)\nTrace amounts of fluorides are also needed for bone development, but get it out of food—not from\nadditives, fluoridated water, toothpaste, etc.\nThe use of sodium fluoride, once thought to help treat osteoporosis, is now known to do the opposite.\nWhile it does increase bone mass in the spine, the bone is inferior in quality. Woman receiving the\ncompound were three times more likely to fracture an arm, leg, or hip than if they took a placebo. As\nlittle as 16 mg of sodium fluoride a day produces abnormal bone marrow cells. Adequate natural\nfluoride is in all food and water sources.\nCalcium supplements include calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, calcium citrate, and calcium\ngluconate. All of these dissolve well, so they are absorbed adequately.\nThe mineral, calcium, has to be combined with another substance in order that it might be maintained in\na stable compound (calcium lactate is calcium plus lactic acid). Calcium carbonate includes a somewhat\nhigher percentage of elemental calcium than do the other forms, but all are beneficial. (Calcium\ncarbonate not only has the highest amount of calcium per tablet, it is the least expensive form.) As with\nmost other supplements, calcium in powder form is more economical than in tablets.\nIt is important that there be sufficient acid in the stomach, in order to absorb the calcium and other\nminerals from the food. An increasing lack of this acid, with age, is part of the reason why older people\ndo not absorb minerals as well and have poor bone structure. If necessary, take supplemental\nhydrochloric acid (betaine HCl) or lemon juice before each meal.\nHorsetail extract is a good source of silica, a vital mineral in the formation of bones. Horsetail, along\nwith oat straw, are consistently recommended as the best supplemental sources for absorbable silica.\nBoron and silica, both needed for good bone formation, are found in horsetail and oat straw. When your\nfriends come over to visit, invite them to have some savory oat straw tea with you!\nAlfalfa, comfrey, and slippery elm also help build strong bones.\nSeaweed (Nova Scotia dulse or Norwegian kelp) is an good source of many major minerals, and an\noutstanding source of the trace minerals.\nKelp, dulse, blue-green algae, hijiki, and kombu are rich in minerals. Wheat grass juice, green drink, and\nliquid chlorophyll are also.\nA summary of minerals which are needed includes silicon, boron, zinc, manganese, and copper, along\nwith calcium. (The body also needs phosphorous and magnesium, but too much of either one inhibits the\nbody from absorbing calcium. These minerals tend to compete with calcium for absorption in the blood\nand bone marrow. In the case of magnesium, though, normal supplementation should not be a problem.)\nThe following substances remove calcium and other minerals from the food before it is digested or leach\nit from the bones: white-sugar products, chocolate, caffeine products, and alcohol. Each of these are\nharmful to the bones.\nVinegar and meat acids also diminish bone mass. This is because other dietetic acids are later changed to\nalkaline forms after they leave the stomach, but not vinegar or meat acid (purines, uric acid, etc.)\nIt is well-known among medical professionals that sugar, coffee, caffeine, a high-meat diet, and smoking\nproduce osteoporosis and similar bone problems.\nOne study of middle-aged men and women with symptomatic osteoporosis were almost exclusively\nheavy smokers.\nA high-sugar diet causes calcium to be excreted in the urine. Excess sodium does this also.\nChocolate contains oxalic acid and prevents the absorption of calcium.\nWomen who drink coffee and soft drinks are more likely to have osteoporosis.\nCertain foods contain oxalic acid in moderate amounts (the cabbage family, which includes kale,\ncollards, almonds, and asparagus), and some contain it in still larger amounts (chard and, especially,\nspinach), and some in extremely large amounts (rhubarb, poke). Avoid oxalic acid foods, if you want\nstrong bones in your old age.\nSome foods contain the calcium inhibitor, solanine. These include tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell\npeppers, and tobacco.\nWhole grains contain phytin, a substance which tends to bind with calcium and prevent its absorption\nand use by the system. Some suggest that you take calcium supplements at different times than grains, to\ninsure its absorption. Those who are in desperate need for additional calcium will want to take this\nadvice. They can take calcium powder near bedtime, when it is best absorbed. Calcium also aids in\nsleeping, for it tends to relax the muscles.\nHigh phosphorous foods tend to compete with calcium and also combine with it, locking it out. Such\nfoods include soft drinks, high-protein animal foods, and yeast products.\nCola drinks are especially harmful in this respect. Cola drinks, frankly, are a terrible concoction: (1)\nThey contain an acid which is stronger than vinegar. (2) The acidity is masked by an excessive amount\nof sugar, which itself leaches calcium from bones. (3) Cola drinks are basically phosphoric acid, or a\nstrong acid in a phosphorous medium. Phosphorous locks directly onto calcium, and carries it out of the\nbody, making it unavailable to the body. A tooth placed in a glass of cola drink will melt away entirely\nwithin a few hours.\nWhite-flour products contain chlorine, which is harmful to the bones.\nDo not use foods with preservatives, because of their phosphorous content.\nDrugs, such as diuretics, inhibit calcium assimilation.\nDo not eat meat or vinegar if you want strong, healthy, joints. A diet high in animal protein tends to\ncauses the body to excrete increased amounts of protein. Beef, for example, contains 25 times as much\nphosphorous as calcium! A high-meat diet will invariably lead to calcium deficiencies.\nA study conducted by The Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that vegetarian women had\nsignificantly less bone loss than women who eat meat.\nAvoid large meals and overeating. Chew your food well, so it will be properly absorbed.\nThe amount of protein a man eats may influence the level of calcium in his body. Tests at Wisconsin\nUniversity, confirmed by other studies, revealed that a high-protein diet causes calcium loss. Eskimos,\non their high-protein diets, had lower bone mineral levels than Americans. In the 60-90 age bracket,\nbone loss in meat eaters was 35%; in vegetarians it was 18%.\nExcessive fat intake reduces bone mass. On test animals, the daily loss of calcium on the high-fat diet\nwas more than four times as much as on the low-fat diet.\nThe harder the fat was, before eating, the more calcium loss it caused.\nExercise strengthens the bones. It causes the body to strengthen the insides of the bones, by increasing\nthe webbing connections within them. Exercise definitely increases bone density. The body must have\nregular weight-bearing exercise, such as walking. When this occurs, more minerals are laid down in the\nbones, to strengthen them—especially where you need it the most: the bones of the legs, hips, and spine.\nConversely, a lack of exercise accelerates the loss of bone mass. It is believed that lack of activity in old\nage is a factor in the increased levels of bone loss in those years.\nDaily exercise outdoors provides vitamin D and stimulates osteoblastic cells. Exercise increases muscle\ntone, strengthens muscles, prevents disuse atrophy and further demineralization of the bones.\nNASA research experts say the best activity for maintaining bone mass is gravitational: walking or\njogging. When you are not pushing against gravity very much (because you are sitting in a chair or lying\nin bed), you are tending to lose bony material. Try to walk at least 20 minutes a day out-of-doors.\n\"Strain changes\" are important in building and maintaining bone mass. How often you do it is more\nimportant than the intensity when it is done. Try to maintain the bounce of earlier years: keep that spring\nin your step; put a little strain on your body and muscles every so often. Do this more moderately as you\nage, but keep it up.\nBed rest tends to cause a negative calcium balance. Bones placed in plaster casts develop localized\nosteoporosis, regardless of the diet, hormonal balance, etc. It is called \"disuse osteoporosis.\" Exercise is\nvital to healthy bones.\nToo much calcium supplementation, during bone healing (when in bed or confined to a chair while\nrecovering from a fracture, etc.), can induce kidney stone formation during the immobile period while\nthe cast is on. The problem is that the person is not active enough at that time.\nAcidophilus in the large bowel is needed for the digestion of food. It is also needed to produce vitamins\nB , B , and folic acid, all of which are needed to make bone mass. Lactic acid foods, such as\n6 12\nsauerkraut, are very helpful.\nSupplementing your diet with two herbs, suma and dong quai, will help regulate hormonal imbalances.\nSuma contains sitosterol. This increases natural estrogen production without stimulating an oversupply.\nFlaxseed oil also helps the body produce needed hormones.\nAvoid chilling. Rats exposed to cold stress developed bone mass which was less dense.\nDistilled water is an excellent way to obtain pure water. But keep in mind that you must also be\nincluding proper minerals in your diet, including some kelp or dulse, to replace the minerals lost by\ndrinking distilled water. (Distilled water is chemically hungry, and locks onto some minerals in your\nbody when you drink it.)\nDo not take estrogen drugs because, although it increases bone mass somewhat, it also places the user at\nhigh risk for cancer. Estrogen therapy initially increases bone formation, but eventually leads to\ndecreased bone mass and lack of response to the parathyroid hormone. Taking estrogen also increases\nthe risk of breast cancer, stroke, and myocardial infarction (heart attack).\nIf you take the thyroid hormone or an anticoagulant drug, increase the amount of calcium you take by 25-\n50%.\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures.\n—Also see \"Fractures\" and \"Osteoporosis\" for additional information on factors affecting bone\nformation and loss.\nENCOURAGEMENT—God's faithful ones are in the majority. They have all heaven on their side, in\nthe battle to fulfill God's will for their lives and resist temptation to sin. Go to Jesus and surrender to\nHim, and He can give you all the help you need.\n\n(Broken Bone)\nSYMPTOMS—There may be extreme pain and tenderness in the injured area, a protruding bone, blood\nunder the skin, or swelling. There may be tingling, numbness, weakness, or paralysis below the fracture.\nA digit, or limb, may be at an abnormal angle or there may be pain at a specific place on a bone.\nA major fracture can cause a loss of pulse below the fracture, weakness, and inability to bear weight.\nCAUSES—A fracture is a crack or break in a bone. If the skin over the bone remains intact, it is a\nclosed or simple fracture; if the bone breaks the skin, it is a compound fracture.\nAccidents are not a common cause of broken bones, but the bone can also be weakened from\nosteoporosis, bone tumors, or metabolic disease. A weakened bone can break much more easily—even\nfrom a slip of the foot, a slight fall, or knocking against something.\nMalnutrition can also be involved. There can be a deficiency of calcium and/or magnesium, or there may\nbe an improper calcium/phosphorous ratio.\nA vibrating tuning fork can be placed against the area; if it causes pain, there is a fracture. X rays will\nconfirm whether it is a fracture or strain or sprain.\nIt is important that the bone be properly set, so it will not thenceforth be deformed, and not function as\nwell.\nOlder people do not absorb calcium and other minerals as well. This begins at 40, increases at 50, and\nvery much so beyond 60. It is believed that 200,000 hip fractures occur in people over 65 every year.\nVery often, this results from osteoporosis. The bone has somewhat hollowed out and the break more\neasily occurred.\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures than other people their age.\nWhen a break occurs, protein fibers form a bridgework between the two parts. Then calcium,\nphosphorous, and silica are deposited between the protein fibers.\n(Oddly enough, although phosphorous is needed for good bone formation, you will find, below, that it is\nimportant that you avoid phosphorous foods if you want strong bones. This is due to the fact that\nphosphorous is the one mineral which is abundantly found in food. Yet too much of it in a meal locks\ninto the calcium and removes it from the body.)\nFirst aid includes covering any wound and immobilizing, or splinting, the broken part in the position it\nwas found (so the problem will not worsen during transport). Take the person to a physician or the\nhospital, depending on the seriousness of the problem. Medical treatment involves placing the bones in\ntheir proper position and keeping them there while healing occurs.",

    "title": "Bone Spur",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Give vitamin C to bowel tolerance, along with vitamin E and magnesium.\n• Correct the calcium/phosphorous ratio by taking 2,000 mg of calcium a day.\n• Research indicates that plant-derived colloidal minerals tend to reverse spurs and\ncalcium deposits, without surgery, by remodeling the bones.\n• Do not eat meat, coffee, sugar, and alcohol. These upset the mineral balance in the body\nand retard healing.\n• Temporarily avoid citrus fruit.\n• A 1-2 week raw food fast can be helpful.\n• Rubbing the bottom of the feet with ice will help draw healing blood to the area. In the\nearly morning, walk barefoot outside on the wet grass. Then come in and dry off; make\nsure your feet are warm afterward.\n• If the shoes are not comfortable, this can make the pain feel worse. Wear rubber heels on\nyour shoes, not leather. Adding heel cushions to your shoes may reduce pain.\n• Avoid walking on hard surfaces.\n• If you usually walk or jog for exercise, try cycling or swimming instead.\n• It may be necessary to have the spur surgically removed, if it is too painful or irritating.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Do not be enticed by seeming advantages or the advice of friends, to do\nwrong. Cling to God and obey His Written Word, and you will have the help that He sees is best for you.\n\n(Heel Spur)\nSYMPTOMS—Possible pain at a place where the bone seems to protrude out from the body more than\nit should.\nCAUSES—A bone spur is a pointed growth on a bone. Occurring most frequently on the heel, the bone\nsticks out and occasionally strikes against something, causing pain. Or there may be ongoing pain at the\nsite.\nBone spurs can cause the formation of tiny, painful, tumors at the end of some of the nerves in that area.\nThose with problems with the heel are generally overweight or middle-aged. But they are also common\nin those who have tendonitis, neuritis, arthritis, or alkalosis.\nIf bone pain is felt at an unusual bumpy, protruding, place, x rays will confirm whether the problem is\narthritis, fracture, bone spur, or possibly primary or metastic bone cancer.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Diet changes, water drinking, and weight control are all very important.\n• The amount of urates in the blood is keyed to dietary intake and the amount of body\nweight. Many in middle life who initially experience the pain of gout are overweight.\n• Those with gout need to reduce to 10-15% below calculated normal weight. However,\nweight reduction must be done gradually, so as not to stir up more urates and temporarily\nincrease the number of gout attacks.\n• Do not fast when you have gout. Doing so greatly increases the amount of uric acids in\nthe blood.\n• Drink at least 2 quarts of water a day between gout attacks, not only to get rid of the uric\nacid, but also to reduce the likelihood of kidney damage and kidney stones. Those with\ngout tend to have kidney stones.\n• A high-carbohydrate diet tends to increase uric acid excretion. In contrast, a high-fat diet\ndecreases excretion and may bring on a gout attack (even though they may be unsaturated\nfats). Keep your diet low in protein and fat.\n• A vegetarian diet is the best program for a person with gout.\n• Avoid excessive food yeast.\n• Eating cherries is very helpful. The uric acid level in the blood decreases and the attacks\ntend to stop. They can be any type of cherries, and either fresh or canned (½ pound per\nday). One or two tbsp. of cherry concentrate can be taken instead. If canned cherries are\nused, only use water-packed ones; most have too much sugar and additives.\n• Overeating tends toward gout.\nHere are foods high in purines: liver, brains, kidneys, heart, anchovies, sardines, meat\nextract, fish roes, herring, consommé, mussels, and sweet breads.\n• Here are foods of lesser purine content: fowl, fish (except those listed above), other\nseafoods, and other meats.\n• Here are foods of moderate amounts: whole-grain cereals, lentils, peas, beans, asparagus,\nmushrooms, oatmeal, cauliflower, and spinach.\n• Here are the foods which have only small amounts of purines; foods containing\nnegligible amounts of purines: vegetables, fruits, refined cereals, cereal products, eggs,\nmilk, cheese.\n• There are cases in which drinking large amounts of milk or eating lots of tomatoes\nproduced gout.\n• Do not take any alcoholic beverage. Alcohol increases uric acid production and reduces\nexcretion of urates.\n• Direct injury to a joint, tending toward gout, can bring on an acute attack.\n• It is known that the skin can excrete uric acid, so baths will help.\n• During acute attacks, keep the affected joint elevated and at rest.\n• Hot fomentations for 15 minutes every 3 hours, to help relieve pain. But, to reduce pain,\nsome do better using cold applications.\n• Mud packs, applied to the affected area, will absorb a fair amount of the uric acid.\n• Charcoal is very helpful. Take it by mouth (12-16 tablets daily), and also lay charcoal\npacks on the area.\n• A compress of comfrey root or leaves, blended with water, helps relieve gout pain.\nApply for two hours or more, or overnight.\n• Burdock will help clean uric acid deposits from the joints and other areas. Kelp, red\nclover, and yucca help eliminate uric acid and other toxins.\n• Colchicine is the primary drug medication for gout. But it causes nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, cramping, hair loss, anemia, liver damage, and decreased leukocytes and\nplatelets. Natural remedies can do the job better.\n• A number of drugs increase uric acid levels, so it is best to avoid drugs. Diuretic drugs\nare especially bad.\n—See \"Arthritis\" for much more information.\n—Also see the author's book, Arthritis and Rheumatism (see order sheet), detailing the findings of 63\nresearch studies on various arthritic and rheumatic conditions.\n—Also see \"Gout—2,\" \"Arthritis—1\" and \"Rheumatoid Gout.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Could the curtain be rolled back, you would see the entire universe intently\nwatching what is occurring on earth.

Sweating baths, especially the\nRadiant Heat Bath and the Steam Bath; long Neutral Baths; Fomentation over painful parts, followed by\nthe well-protected Heating Compress; water drinking; aseptic diet.\nGOUT—1\nSYMPTOMS—Sudden attack, often in the middle of the night, of extreme pain and swelling of a joint\nin the fingers or toes (usually the big toe). But it can affect the ankles, knees, hands, elbows, and wrists.\nMotion or pressure greatly increases the pain. After the swelling subsides, the skin tends to itch and peel.\nDuring attacks, there often is loss of appetite, stomach and intestinal problems, fever, and decreased\nurine output.\nCAUSES—Gout is an acute type of inflammatory arthritis, and occurs most often in people who are\noverweight or eat rich foods, such as meat, gravies, spices, and alcohol.\nThe body cannot handle all the purines and other acids in the meat, and so these products settle in the\nbody. Uric acid is the end-product of the breakdown of purine compounds.\nGout typically attacks the smaller joints of the feet and hands, especially the big toe. Uric acid salts\ncrystallize in the joint, and produce swelling, redness, and a sensation of heat and extreme pain.\nUnlike most forms of arthritis, gout affects men in 90% of the cases. It generally does not begin until\nafter 35 years of age; peak age of onset is 45. Women who have it are generally post-menopausal.",

    "contentEn": "(Muscle Pain, Leg Cramps; Charley Horse)\nSYMPTOMS—A pain in a body muscle, most often in the legs (especially the calf muscles) or feet.\nCAUSES—Muscle cramps may occur at any age. Between the ages of 15 to 80, a full 50% of people\nwill, at some time, have pain or cramps in the legs. Leg pains in children are frequent enough that they\nare called \"growing pains.\"\nReduced blood supply to the legs is part of the problem. Another is an imbalance in the levels of calcium\nand magnesium in the body or a deficiency of vitamin E.\nBut other causes have also been noted: arthritis, anemia, tobacco usage, inactivity, poor circulation, too\nmuch or too little exercise, muscle injury, allergy, fibromyalgia, arteriosclerosis, dehydration,\nhypothyroidism, heat stroke, and varicose veins. Diuretic drugs for heart problems, or hypertension can\nalso induce cramps. Those who have had part of the stomach removed tend to have muscle cramps\nthereafter.\nIf cramping occurs when walking and stops when you cease, it may be impaired circulation and nothing\nmore.\nIf leg cramps occur during pregnancy, they may be caused by hormone changes, fatigue, uterine\npressure, chilling, or muscle tenseness.\nA calcium deficiency can make the leg muscles trigger-happy; the contractions in the muscles are\nstronger.\nLeg cramps in older people may be caused by arteriosclerotic changes in the circulatory system. Turn to\nthe articles on heart and blood vessels, and see your physician. Vitamin E (600-800 IU daily) is very\nhelpful.\nIMMEDIATE TREATMENT—\n• Massage the muscles and use heat to relieve pain.\n• A heating pad may be applied to the area. For some, alternate hot and cold compresses\nwork better (heat for 6 minutes and cold for 30 seconds, with 4 changes).\n• Drink peppermint tea and apply it as an external compress.\n• Pinch the upper lip between the thumb and index finger, and hold for 20-30 seconds till\nthe cramping disappears.\n• If you are pregnant and cramping occurs, push the toes upward while applying pressure\nto the knee, to flatten the affected part.\n• Here is the strangest advice of all: The next day, repeat the activity that made you sore.\nDo it with much less intensity. This will help work out the soreness. Thereafter, follow\nthis hard/easy routine; for it takes 48 hours for the muscle to properly recover. This is how\nserious athletes train.\n• An alternate method is to vary activities, such as regular walking, with occasional biking\nor swimming instead.\n• After hard exercise or physical work, slow down instead of stopping suddenly. The\nbloodstream is loaded with lactic acid; so slowly exercise at a relaxed pace while it drains\noff. (However, that will not protect you from soreness the next day, resulting from torn\nmuscle fiber.)\n• Perhaps you need to change into more comfortable shoes, in order to improve your leg\nand foot problems.\nONGOING CARE—The blood circulation needs to be improved and equalized.\nDrink enough water each day.\nA common mistake is to drink water and take salt tablets during heated exercise. Instead, you need a full\nrange of electrolytes, and not so much sodium chloride. Drink fruit drinks. At mealtime, eat lots of fresh\nfruits and vegetables. Include seaweed in your diet. Potassium broth (from thick white potato peelings)\nis excellent.\nA fat-free, sugar-free, salt-free diet improves the circulation.\nEat an abundance of green leafy vegetables, in order to improve the quality of the blood and the mineral\nbalance.\nAlfalfa, brewer's yeast, and kelp are important.\nA deficiency of calcium, potassium, selenium, and vitamin E exists.\nMineral imbalances can produce cramping. Be sure you are getting enough calcium through\nsupplementation. Otherwise the phosphorous in certain foods locks with it, so the calcium cannot be\nabsorbed. See \"Bones, Strengthening\" for more information on solving the calcium-phosphorous\nproblem.\nThose with dentures, who find eating vegetables difficult, are especially prone to magnesium and\ncalcium deficiency and leg cramps. They should have vegetable soups, potassium broth, and raw\nvegetable juices daily.\nEvery 3 hours, drink a large glass of quality water, to help clean the bloodstream, liver, kidneys, and\nbowels of stored toxins.\nDrink less whole milk\nEat your meals slowly and chew well.\nDo not smoke. Nicotine greatly impedes blood circulation. Avoid second-hand smoke.\nIf you are taking diuretic drugs, take supplemental potassium. Better yet, switch to corn-silk tea and\nother herbal diuretics; also drink more water (see the several articles on kidneys and urine).\nDo not stand in one position for hours without moving. Some motion or shifting of body weight is vital.\nGet off your feet for 5 minutes every hour. If possible, during that time, take your shoes off; massage\nyour feet and wiggle your toes.\nDo not sit with crossed legs.\nStretch your legs every so often, with the feet flexed up, not down.\nWhen sitting, try to elevate your feet every so often.\nDo not wear garters or any binding clothes.\nAt night, wear roomy pajamas.\nKeep the bed covers loose or use a foot cradle, to keep bedding weight off the feet. If you sleep on your\nstomach, extend your feet over the edge of the bed. Another method is to sleep on your side, with your\nlegs bent and a pillow between your knees.\nRub olive or flaxseed oil into your muscles before and after strenuous exercise.\nTwice a day, soak in a tub of warm water (100o-110o F.). Massage the toes, feet, and calves.\nHere is an exercise which really helps stop ongoing lower leg cramps for many people: Stand with shoes\noff, facing a wall 2-3 feet away. Lean forward, bracing against the wall with hands and arms, all the\nwhile keeping your heels on the floor. When a moderate pull is felt in the calves, hold that position for\n10 seconds.\nThen stand straight for 5 seconds of rest, and lean forward and repeat. Do 3 stretching cycles.\nIf you are overweight, reduce to normal range or slightly below.\nIf leg cramps are caused by varicose veins or pregnancy, elevate the foot of the bed 9 inches.\nIf leg cramping occurs during pregnancy, take frequent rest periods with the feet elevated. Wear\ncomfortable, not tight, clothing. Be sure you are getting enough calcium; this is important.\n—Also see \"Claudication,\" which has the same leg symptoms—but some very special, dangerous\ncauses. It also has additional information on improving the circulation of the legs.\nENCOURAGEMENT—In His service, God will place upon you no restriction that will not increase\nyour happiness. In complying with His requirements, you will find a peace, contentment, and joy you\ncan never have in the path of sin.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• According to one view, sprains should be treated with ice or very cold water. Follow this\nby bandaging the injury with an Ace bandage.\n• But, according to a different view, sprains should be initially treated with alternate hot\nand cold—especially if it is in the wrist, elbow, or ankle. This method works better than\nusing cold alone!\n• Put the injured part in very hot water, and keep it there 20-30 minutes. Every few\nminutes take it out of the hot water and plunge it into cold water for about a minutes, then\nback into the hot. Keep the hot water hot. This can continue for up to 2 hours with good\nresults.\n• Repeat this for several days; and, twice a day, massage around the area.\n• If you use the cold method alone on a sprain, you may not be able to walk on a sprained\nankle for days; use the alternate hot and cold method, and you may be much better in half\nthe time.\n• (A third method calls for cold on strains to begin with, to reduce initial swelling,\nfollowed by alternate hot and cold afterward.)\n• If the sprain or strain is in the back or shoulder, treat it with hot fomentations, short cold,\nand massage.\n• A bad bruise on any part of the body can be treated as for a sprain or strain.\n• In addition to the above, strains frequently require a cast similar to that used for a\nfracture, so the injured joint area can be immobilized for more complete rest.\n• DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is a liquid that can be applied externally to the injured area,\nto relieve pain, reduce swelling, and promote healing. But only buy it in the health food\nstore.\n—Also see \"Athletic Workouts.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Those who put away iniquity from their hearts and stretch out their hands in\nearnest supplication unto God will have that help which God alone can give them. In His strength, you\ncan fulfill His will for your life.\n# ATHLETIC WORKOUTS (Strengthening the Muscles)\nPREPARATION—Here are a few helpful suggestions for those engaged in ongoing athletic workouts\nor other heavy labor or activity:\nMaintain a nutritious diet, including full vitamin/mineral supplementation. Eat salads, whole grains,\nseaweed, seeds, nuts, and drink vegetable juices.\nMaintain strong bones (see \"Bones, Strengthening\"). Include silica (horsetail and oat straw herbs), to\nhelp calcium strengthen the bones.\nVitamins A, D, E, C, zinc, and manganese are needed.\nAt the meal before a workout, do not eat much roughage, requiring energy to digest; it will make you\nsluggish. At that meal, avoid peaches, grapes, bananas, and celery.\nLocate your allergies and eliminate them. If you have food allergies, exercise may increase the\nabsorption of the allergenic food, resulting in severe reactions. See \"Allergies\" and \"Pulse Test.\"\nGlucose is the main fuel for the muscles. It is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen.\nYou can only work as long as you have stored glycogen ready to be changed into glucose. The best way\nto store up this glycogen is to eat complex carbohydrates.\nAlthough body fat can also be converted to energy, avoid eating much fat. Focus on getting\ncarbohydrates, not fat, in your diet.\nProteins are needed for muscles and tissues; they are not an energy source. The need for protein does not\nincrease during a workout. Excess protein intake (at any time) increases urine elimination, which\nproduces dehydration unless you are drinking enough water. Eating too much protein can damage the\nkidneys.\nStretch and warm up your muscles before exercising. Before doing this, muscles are about 98o F. and\nstiff. After a 5 minutes warm-up, they are several degrees higher and ready for action.\nDrink fluids before, during, and after workouts. To prevent dehydration and cramping, do this whether\nor not you are thirsty.\nBe sure and obtain adequate electrolytes. A 50-50 mix of fruit juice and water will help supply this.\nAfter a workout, keep moving until you are rested. Do not take a shower until your body temperature\nhas cooled down. This cooling down wait will help you avoid cramping and even a heart attack.\nDo not use steroids in order to increase muscle mass and athletic performance! You may see temporary\ngain, but you are injuring your body.\nIn men, Dr. Graham Reedy, M.D, says that long-term use can lead to cancer, sterility, breast\nenlargement, shrinkage of the testicles, and osteoporosis (hollowing of the bones, leading to breakage).\nAfter mentioning some of the diseases steroid usage can lead to, Graham Reedy, M.D., adds: \"Once the\nsteroid treatments are stopped, all the buildup is lost, and fat tends to infiltrate the\ntissue.\" (Complementary Medicine/Sports Review, March/April 1986, p. 33.)\nIn women, excess facial and body hair, breast cancer, shrinkage of the breasts may occur.\nSteroids tend to be psychologically addictive. The person feels dependent on taking them, until the\nphysical damage becomes deeply ingrained. Anabolic steroids can produce heart attacks.\nDo not lift weights if you have a heart problem. At the moment of the lift, breathing stops, circulation to\nthe heart decreases, and great pressure is placed on the heart and lungs by surrounding muscles.\nENCOURAGEMENT—Real happiness is found only in being good and doing good. Live to bless\nothers, and you will find your deepest satisfaction. Live only for yourself, and you will perish alone.\nSection 10\nMuscular-Skeletal\nPart 6\nSpine\n# POSTURE, IMPROVING\nSYMPTOMS—A round-shouldered appearance.\nIt is easy, over the years, to let your posture collapse. Here are several suggestions to get it back into\nshape:\n• Relax and practice standing up straight. Put your back and head against a wall as you\nlook forward. Hold it for a minute and get a feel for what the ideal is like.\n• Recognize that, as you go through the day, you will not always maintain this ideal. But it\ngives you something to work toward.\n• The best place to practice good posture is when you are walking outside. Try to walk\nerect. Notice that doing so makes it easier to take full breaths of air, and you feel better.\n• Then, when it is time to work, relax, and work, do not worry about keeping a ramrod\nback when you are stooping over, writing, washing the dishes, etc. Real living is not\nramrod; it is a variety of positions.\n• But, when you take your outdoor exercise, return closer to that ideal of perfect posture.\nHere are more ideas:\n• Lie on the floor with your chin down and head straight forward.\n• When you stand, keep both feet flat on the floor. Resting on one leg leads to curvature of\nthe back.\n• Adjust your chair height, so that your thighs are be parallel with the floor and your knees\nare level with, or slightly higher than, your hips. If not, they pull your body forward; your\nback slumps; and you work harder, trying keep your back upright.\n• If you place a small pillow between the small of your back (the lumbar area) and the\nback of the chair, you will tend to sit straighter.\n• As you are sitting, you ought to be able to feel the bones in your buttocks against the\nseat. If you cannot do so, wiggle around until you can. When you cannot feel them, you\nare slumping.\n• When seated at a table and not working, sit 6-8 inches away from it. This will keep you\nfrom slumping over onto it. Only your wrists will be on the edge of the table before you.\nMaintain this same distance if you are working on a computer or typewriter.\nTelevision news announcers use the following two methods, to make a better appearance when they talk\nwhile being seated:\n• (1) Tend to sit on the edge of your chair; you will be less likely to slump back into it.\n• (2) While sitting on the edge of your chair, curl one foot under the chair and stretch the\nother out for balance. This will help keep your back straight.\n• Do not cross your legs. Doing so throws your body out of alignment. Keep your feet flat\non the floor.\n• In a car, pull the seat toward the pedals, until your knees are bent and slightly higher\nthan your hips, and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Either place a small cushion\nbehind the small of your back or use the seat adjustment available in some cars.\n• Get enough sleep at night. You cannot stand or sit straight if you are exhausted.\n• Sleep on a firm mattress. When you lie on your side, both hips and shoulders should sink\nin just a little.\n• When sleeping, either sleep on the side, with a pillow under your head, thick enough to\nkeep your head untilted, or sleep on your back, with only a thin pillow under your head\nand possibly a small pillow under your knees.\n• Walk, run, cycle, or do exercises and stretching, to keep your muscles stretched and in\ngood condition.\n• Here is a way to rest your back and improve your posture at the same time, either during\nbreak or at the end of the day: Lie on the floor for a few minutes with your legs on a low\nchair or stool.\nENCOURAGEMENT—A ransom has been paid for the souls of men, but we must individually\nsurrender our lives to God, so that we may claim that ransom. God has a heaven full of blessings for\nyou.\n\n(Sprains and Strains)\nSYMPTOMS—Bruised wrists, ankles, fingers, knees, back, hips, and sore or swollen muscles.\nCAUSES—Muscle injuries can occur when straining muscles too much, using them too long or hard,\nsuddenly twisting, or hard falls.\nAthletes frequently have such problems.\nSprains are a painful stretching of ligaments of the joints, caused by lifting, sudden stops or turns,\ninjuries, or falls.\nStrains are more severe; They involve torn ligaments and torn joint capsule, with bleeding and swelling.\nThe following suggestions are good both for prevention and treatment of injuries:",

    "id": "disease-musculoskeletal-backache",
    "title": "Backache",
    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\nFirst, we will consider less serious back pain:\n• The most common cause of backache is muscle strain. Rest will generally eliminate the\nproblem. Bed rest for 24 hours may be needed.\n• Soaking in a tub of warm water may be quite relaxing to a strained back.\n• For the first 72 hours after a back strain occurs, an 8-minute ice massage often helps.\nUse ice cubes (or freeze water in a paper cup or frozen fruit- juice can). Massage the area\nand about 6-8 inches around it.\n• After 72 hours, use alternate hot and cold applications. Apply a wrung-out hot towel for\n30 seconds, followed by brief cold. Do this 4-5 times.\n• Ice packs are especially helpful in relieving muscles spasms.\n• Moist heat reduces local inflammation and increases blood flow to the area.\n• Some people think that staying in bed for a week will help back pain. This is not true. If\nyou remain in bed a week, it will take two weeks to rehabilitate.\n• Stretching a sore back will tend to accelerate the healing process. Gently bring your\nknees up from the bed and to your chest. Once there, put a little pressure on your knees.\nStretch, then relax. Do this again.\nPreventive measures that will help you, either before or after experiencing back problems:\n• Be very careful when lifting something. Take several deep breaths, to increase muscle\nstrength and then slowly lift with the legs, not the back, and hold the object close to your\nbody. Do not lift from a bending forward position (closing windows, lifting things from\ndeep in the car trunk).\n• Keep the body warm and do not become overly fatigued. When the muscles are chilled\nor you are exhausted, it is easier to injure joints because the muscles are not able to do the\nwork needed.\n• Do not take a hot bath just before doing heavy exercise, for your muscles will be in a\nweaker condition.\n• Proper nutrition, including adequate amounts of calcium, minerals, vitamin D, etc. See\n\"Bones, Strengthening\" for much more on this.\nExercises, to build the muscles are very important, if you would avoid back trouble. More on this later in\nthis article.\n• Walking and rowing are good for the back (walking is good for just about everything!).\n• When sleeping, either a firm mattress should be used or a ¾-inch thick ply board should\nbe placed beneath the top mattress. Place 1-2 pillows under the knees to straighten the\nlumbar curve. When lying on the side, flex the knees and place a pillow between them.\n• Avoid sleeping on the stomach; it increases the swayback and twists the neck. This is\ndue to the fact that the trunk, being heavier, sinks farther into the bed, causing the back to\narch.\n• It is reported that water beds, which do not make a lot of waves, may help people with\nback trouble to sleep.\n• When you get out of bed, roll out slowly and carefully. Do not sit straight up in bed.\n• If you have back pain, slide to the edge of the bed. Then, keeping your back rigid, let\nyour legs off the bed first. That will act as a springboard, lifting your upper body up and\noff the bed.\n• Sit in a straight chair with a firm back. The knees should be higher than the hips; if\nnecessary, use a small footstool. Avoid soft sofas and stuffed chairs. Chair arms help\nsupport the shoulders and upper back. Get up and move about every so often.\n• When in a car, push the car seat forward, to raise the knees higher than the hips. This\nlessens back and shoulder strain. Use safety belts.\n• Look for a car with adjustable lumbar support, and adjust the support down as low as it\ngoes. Then, if necessary, raise it a notch or two.\n• Do not stand in one position for long periods.\n• High-heeled shoes will bring trouble sooner or later. Women should wear low-heeled\nshoes if they want to protect their pelvic organs and spine.\n• Good posture when sitting, standing, or walking should be the goal.\nExercises to strengthen the back:\n• Do press-ups which are half a push-up. Lie on the floor, on your stomach. Keep your\npelvis flat on the floor and push up with your hands, arching your back as you lift your\nshoulders off the floor. This will help strengthen your lower back.\n• Do floor swimming. Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise your left arm and right leg.\nHold for one second, then alternate with the right arm and left leg. Go back and forth. This\nextends and strengthens the lower back.\n• Do a crunch sit-up. Lay on your back on the floor, with knees flexed and feet flat on the\nfloor. Cross your arms with your hands on your shoulders. Raise your head and shoulders\noff the floor as high as you can while keeping your lower back on the floor. Hold for one\nsecond, then repeat.\n• Know your limit when exercising. If you feel fine 1-2 days after exercising, then it is\nsafe to continue them.\n• Spinal surgery: Should you have a back operation? Sometimes the problem is so serious\nthat a back operation is necessary. But, if at all possible, try to avoid having one. Not only\nare they expensive, but frequently do not solve your movement and pain problems. It is an\nintriguing fact that, according to U.S. government reports, only 1% of those with back\npain obtains relief from back surgery. And there is always the possibility that the\noperation will only result in greater pain, more serious damage, and even less mobility.\nBut, after weighing all the possibilities, you may still decide to undergo it.\n—Also see \"Sciatica.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Those who come frequently to the throne of grace, offering up sincere,\nearnest, prayers for God's help will not fail of fulfilling His plan for their lives.\nSCOLIOSIS—1\n(Curvature of the Spine)\nSYMPTOMS—The spine is curved slightly to one side.\nCAUSES—Scoliosis occurs 80% of the time in girls, and primarily in preteen and teen years, during\nrapid growth spurts.\nDiagnosis is made by having the person bend over away from you. Look for lateral deviation (a leaning\nto the left or right).\nThe primary cause is that one set of the spinal muscles (right side or left side) is stronger than the other.\nThis causes an \"S\" curve in the spine.\nThese changes are the result of degeneration of muscles on one side; and, in some instances, they may\nbe the early stage of muscular dystrophy.\n• In the early stages, scoliosis can be eliminated. But the person must be faithful in taking\nmineral and vitamin supplements. Failure to do so can result in serious damage, back\nbraces, and surgery.\n• Avoid food allergies, eat a nourishing diet; drop all junk foods, caffeine, alcohol, soft\ndrinks, etc.\n• Each day take vitamin E (800-1,200 IU), selenium (500-1,000 mcg), calcium (2,000\nmg), and magnesium (1,000 mg).\n—See \"Scoliosis—2.\"(next article) Also see \"Bones, Strengthening\" for much more information.\nENCOURAGEMENT—No sin is small in God's sight; but, in His strength, we can resist all temptation\nto leave His side and run after the trinkets Satan offers us. Cling to Jesus and, in spite of the\ndisappointments of earth, you will have peace of heart.\nSCOLIOSIS—2\n(Curvature of the Spine; Posterior-Lateral Scoliosis) (J.H.\nKellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nTO IMPROVE GENERAL NUTRITION AND BLOOD MOVEMENT—Graduated Tonic Friction\nbaths; massage, carefully administered; nutritious aseptic dietary; sweating baths, especially the Radiant\nHeat Bath followed by Cold Mitten Friction, carefully given; copious water drinking.\nTO COMBAT LOCAL MORBID PROCESSES—Fomentation to the back twice daily, followed by\nHeating Compress to spine. The Heating Compress may be applied at night and retained until morning.\nHot Leg Bath with Fomentation to the spine; prolonged Neutral Bath, 1-4 hours daily.\nTO RELIEVE COLONIC SPASM AND NERVOUS IRRITABILITY—Warm Bath at 960-1000 F.;\nprolonged Neutral Pail Pour to the spine at 930-980 F., with Heating Compress at night; Rest in bed\nwhen symptoms are progressing.\nFOR MUSCULAR WEAKNESS OR PARALYSIS—Massage, exercise of muscles, special\ngymnastics.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid the Cold Douche and other general Cold Baths, prolonged Hot\nBaths, exercise to the extent of fatigue.\n—Also see \"Scoliosis—1.\" (the above article)\nSection 10\nMuscular-Skeletal\nPart 7\nAbdominal\nPERITONITIS—1\nSYMPTOMS—Severe abdominal pain and tenderness, rigidity of the abdominal muscles, fever, rapid\npulse, sunken eyes, vomiting, and a pinched expression of the face.\nCAUSES—Peritonitis is serious and frequently fatal. Take the person to the hospital.\nIt is caused by blows, stab wounds, gunshot wounds, complication of a surgical operation, appendicitis,\nchildbirth, or ovarian disease.\nLess common is chronic peritonitis, also called tuberculosis peritonitis. This is tubercular in origin, and\nshows little pain or fever and few symptoms other than great emaciation, loss of strength, and fluid in\nthe abdominal cavity.\n• Use warm, whole, baths or warm, wet, packs over the abdomen. A castor oil pack is also\ngood.\n• If there is pain, take a slippery elm retention enema every morning.\n• Go on a 3-day carrot juice fast or a diet of oatmeal gruels, lentil and barley soup, and\nother potassium fruits and vegetables.\n• During the inflammatory stage, avoid eating. Instead, drink as much slippery elm tea as\npossible, sipping it continually.\n• Helpful herb teas include bryonia, pleurisy root, and aconite.\n• Once past the critical stage, drink comfrey root tea every 3-4 hours, along with echinacea\ntablets.\n• If the condition is tuberculosis peritonitis, the patient should be treated as for\ntuberculosis (which see).\n—Also see \"Peritonitis—2,\" \"Appendicitis,\" and \"Tuberculosis.\"\nENCOURAGEMENT—Jesus cares for each one, as though there were not another in the whole world.\nYou can trust your case with Him. He will not fail you. Your only danger is in leaving His side, to\nfollow after the luring temptations Satan offers you.\nPERITONITIS—2\n(J.H. Kellogg, M.D., Formulas)\nPERITONITIS (ACUTE) —\nDIETETIC FACTORS—Rest in bed, fluid diet, fruit juice without sugar, gruels of dextrinized or\nmalted cereals, withhold food for 24-48 hours.\nALBUMIN IN URINE—Hot Blanket Pack and other sweating measures to maintain cutaneous activity,\nrepeated every 2-4 hours.\nFEVER—Hot Blanket Pack, followed by Cold Mitten Friction; prolonged Neutral Bath, Fomentation to\nabdomen with Cooling Wet Sheet Pack at the same time.\nGENERAL ASPECTS—Enema at 800 F., repeating, to remove gas. Fomentation every 2 hours for 15-\n20 minutes. During interval between, apply Heating Compress at 600 F., changing every 5 minutes while\nthe body temperature is elevated, less frequently as temperature falls. Copious water drinking; prolonged\nNeutral bath; cold Compress or Ice Bag over heart for 15 minutes, 2-3 times a day, for cardiac weakness.\nPREVENT OBSTRUCTION—Large enema 3 times a day from beginning, temperature 750 F.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—Same as Chronic form, just below.\nPERITONITIS (CHRONIC) —\nGENERAL ASPECTS—Aseptic dietary, liquid diet. Hot Enema followed by Fomentation to abdomen\nfor 20 minutes, 3 times daily; well-protected Heating Compress during the interval between. Copious\nwater drinking; graduated cold applications (Tonic Frictions), twice daily. If temperature is elevated,\nNeutral Bath half an hour to an hour daily.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS—Avoid Cold Full Baths, Prolonged Cold Douche, Cold Pail Pour, Cold\nWet Sheet Rub, and Cold Sitz.\nPERITONITIS (PELVIC), CELLULITIS —\nBASIC CONSIDERATIONS—Surgical and puerperal asepsis, care to avoid exposures at menstrual\nperiods, protection of feet and legs in damp and cold weather, proper clothing.\nINCREASE RESISTANCE—Cold Mitten Friction or Cold Towel Rub 2-4 times a day, protecting\npelvic viscera by simultaneous Hot Foot Pack or Hot Foot and Leg Pack or by hot water bottle to sacrum\nand Cold Compress over stomach area.\nCOMBAT LOCAL INFLAMMATION—Hot Hip and Leg Pack 20 minutes every 2 hours; during\nintervals between, Cold Compress at 600 F. to area over stomach, pudenda and inner surfaces of thighs,\nwith heat to feet and legs or ice bag over seat of pain; hot water bottles or Fomentations to feet, hips and\nthighs; hot and cold pelvic compress with ice bag over seat of pain, continue 20-40 minutes and repeat\nwhen needed; hot vaginal irrigation at 1100-1200 F., one gallon, every 4 hours.\nENCOURAGE RESOLUTION—After the acute stage has passed, apply Alternate Compress for 30\nminutes, 3 times a day; during interval, Heating Compresses, changing every 2 hours or as soon as well-\nwarmed; Graduated Baths for tonic purposes; alternate vaginal irrigation (1100, 800 to 700 F.); later,\npelvic massage.\nPAIN—Fomentation or Revulsive Compress every 2-4 hours or oftener, if necessary.\nCONSTIPATION—Large Hot Enemas, twice a day, during acute pain and inflammation; later,\ngraduated Cold Enema.\nCHILL—Anticipate chill by wrapping her in warm blankets with hot bags to trunk and limbs; hot water\ndrinking.\nSEPTlC FEVER—Add to local measures, if fever is high, Hot Blanket Pack 10-15 minutes, followed\nby sweating Wet Sheet Pack, Prolonged Neutral Bath. If suppuration (pussing) occurs, surgical\ninterference is generally indicated.\nCAUTIONS—Avoid Cold Baths; instead use partial cold applications, such as the Cold Mitten Friction\nand the Cold Towel Rub.\n—Also see \"Peritonitis—1.\"\n\n(Low Back Pain; Sciatica; Slipped Disk; Lumbar Disk\nHerniation; Spinal Disk Prolapse)\nSYMPTOMS—Pain in the back, frequently in the lower back.\nIf pain comes after lifting something heavy, after coughing, or after unusually heavy exercise, and the\npain prevents you from moving or shoots down one leg, you may have a herniated disk.\nCAUSES—Backache, or pain felt in the spinal column, is one of the most common reasons for\nhospitalization in the Western world. Your spinal column has a complicated interconnection of muscles,\ntendons, bones, and ligaments.\nIt is helpful to identify the various parts of the spine, also called the vertebrae (singular is vertebra): The\ntop part of the spine, where the neck is located, is called the cervical spine (or cervicals); the shoulder\nand mid-part (which protrudes outward in an adult) is called the thoracic; the lower portion (called the\nhollow of the back) is the lumbar; and the bottom part (ending in the tailbone or coccyx) is the sacrum.\nThe first cervical is the atlas. This enables your head to tilt up or down. The second is the axis; it permits\nyour head to turn from side to side.\nAches and pains in the lower back can be a chronic problem. This pain can be in the spine or it can be in\nthe sacroiliac. The sacroiliac joint connects (articulates is the correct word) the spine to the pelvic bone.\n(There can also be pain in the muscles of the lower back; it is called lumbago.)\nA subluxation occurs when two vertebrae get out of proper alignment with one another. A chiropractor\nputs these back in place for relatively little cost.\nSciatica is chronic pain in the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve in the body. This nerve, which\npasses down through the upper leg, can experience neuralgia and neuritis as a result of a pinched nerve\nin the lumbar region. If the problem is not solved, eventually the leg where the pain is may no longer\nreceive nerve signals from the brain or the central nervous system.\nThe intervertebral disks (also spelled discs) are made of cartilage and act as cushions between the\nvertebrae. Each disk has a tough, fibrous, outer layer surrounding a soft interior, which provides the\ncushioning.\nLumbar disk herniation and lumbar disk prolapse occur when the disk herniates (ruptures or breaks) and\nsome of this soft inner disk material pushes outward against the spinal cord to one degree or another.\nThis may be very serious; and, like sciatica, it can lead to muscle wasting, reduced nerve reflexes, and\nmuscle weakness. Disk herniation and prolapse are often erroneously referred to as a \"slipped disk.\"\nCauses of lower-back pain include wrenched or damaged muscles, bones, tendons, or ligaments, Kidney\nor bladder infection, prostate problems, or female pelvic disorders may cause backache. Overeating,\noverdrinking, eating the wrong kinds of food, and constipation can also be involved. The spinal bones,\nand muscles attached to them, are weakened by wrong habits. Chronic conditions causing back pain\ninclude arthritis, bone disease, or abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis).\nOther causes of back pain are poor posture, walking habits, improper shoes, lifting, straining, calcium\ndeficiency, slouching when sitting, or soft mattresses.\nThere is a definite relationship between smoker's cough and severe back pain. Injecting the nicotine\nequivalent of one cigarette decidedly reduced the measured blood flow in the vertebral body. It is also\nthought that using tobacco interferes with the elasticity of connective tissue.\nA small percentage of lower-back pain may be linked to flat feet.\nSometimes a serious case of constipation will cause an ache in the back, from impacted stools or\npressure from gas.\n(More rarely, back pain can result from congenital abnormalities, metabolic disorders, cancer, or\nreferred syndromes.)\nThe back pain can also be the result of an excess of lactic acid in the muscles, following muscular\nexercise. Drinking enough water helps lessen this problem.\nWhere can you go to get help with your bad back? There are lots of experts out there:\nChiropractors adjust the back by pushing and thrusting. They also recommend nutritional and lifestyle\nchanges. In 1994, the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research issued a report, that\nchiropractors generally provided the most effective treatments for acute back pain. They cost far less, do\nthe job quicker, and do not give medicinal drugs (most of which are usually poisonous). The British\nMedical Journal reported that chiropractic treatments proved more successful than hospital treatments in\nnearly every way.\nX rays are generally considered a routine part of back pain diagnosis; yet only a few back conditions\nshow up on x rays! If the pain is caused by muscle strain or a herniated disk, an x ray will not reveal\nanything because muscles, disks, and ligaments are all soft tissues. Beware of x rays if you are pregnant.\nOrthopedic surgeons are another source of help. These are medical doctors who also do back surgery,\nthey are very likely to recommend it—and that is something you want to avoid, if at all possible.\nOsteopaths can prescribe drugs and do surgery also, but they are less likely to do so.\nPhysiatrists, also called doctors of physical medicine, are also medical doctors. They have a good record\nof helping to solve serious back problems (such as disk problems) without resorting to surgery (which\nthey are not licensed to do). They recommend lifestyle changes, back braces, etc.\nPhysical therapists try to restore muscle strength and joint and spine mobility.\nWhich back pains are the most serious?\nBack pain that comes on suddenly, for no apparent reason.\nBack pain that is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, stomach cramps, chest pain, or\ndifficult breathing.\nAn acute attack of back pain that lasts more than 2-3 days, without any relief.\nChronic pain which lasts more than 2 weeks.\nPain in the back which radiates down the leg to the knee or foot.",

    "contentEn": "TREATMENT\n• Give a nourishing diet, restricting all salt. Put on a water and fresh fruit and vegetable\njuice diet. Eat no solid food until the fever subsides and joint pain is reduced. Then\nmaintain a light diet, including fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, etc.\n• Avoid caffeine, fried foods, soft drinks, processed or refined foods, sugar, or salt.\n• Bioflavonoids are especially valuable in preventing and treating rheumatic fever.\n• Bed rest is very important.\n• While in bed, massage and mild exercise is helpful. A planned exercise program should\nbe undertaken later.\n• Useful herbs include bayberry bark, goldenseal, yellow dock, pau d'arco, and burdock\nroot. Echinacea and dandelion are also good.\nENCOURAGEMENT—To many, as to Mary, Christ says, \"Why weepest Thou? Whom seekest thou?\"\nHe is close beside us, but so often our tear-blinded eyes do not discern Him. Pray earnestly for help, and\nyou will feel Him near.\n\nSYMPTOMS—Pain, inflammation, and stiffness in a large joint, such as the knee. These initial\nsymptoms are accompanied by pain.\nThe pain and swelling can travel from one joint to another. A skin rash may also appear.\nCAUSES—Rheumatic fever is a streptococcal disease (Streptococcus Group A), and occurs between the\nages of 4 and 18. It tends to follow a bout with tonsillitis, scarlet fever, strep throat, or an ear infection;\nmost often strep throat (see \"Tonsillitis\")\nAfter the disease appears ended, it may recur again later.\nRheumatic fever affects one or several body organs or locations: joints (arthritis), brain (chorea), tissues\n(nodules), skin (erythema marginatum), or heart (carius). It may also result in residual heart disease,\nproducing permanent damage to one or more heart valves. (See \"Arthritis\" and \"Chorea.\")\nThe residual heart valve damage is the most dangerous aspect of untreated rheumatic fever. Treatment\nearly in the course of the disease will generally prevent the heart damage. But this treatment may require\nthe help of a physician and a stay in the hospital.
